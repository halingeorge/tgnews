      <p>GKIDS has released another trailer for the fantastic looking and beautifully animated film <b><i>Weathering With You</i></b>, from the director of <i>Your Name</i>, <b>Makoto Shinkai</b>. The film is Japan’s biggest box office hit of the year and has been receiving a ton of critical praise. If you like <i>Your Name</i>, this is a film that you’ve gotta see!</p>
      <p>I feel like I’ve been reporting on this film for so long and I can’t wait to finally be able to watch it! The new trailer offers lots of stunning new footage and also praise from those who have already had a chance to see it. Here’s the synopsis:</p>
      <blockquote>The summer of his high school freshman year, Hodaka runs away from his remote island home to Tokyo, and quickly finds himself pushed to his financial and personal limits. The weather is unusually gloomy and rainy every day, as if to suggest his future. He lives his days in isolation, but finally finds work as a writer for a mysterious occult magazine. Then one day, Hodaka meets Hina on a busy street corner. This bright and strong-willed girl possesses a strange and wonderful ability: the power to stop the rain and clear the sky…</blockquote>
      <p><i>Your Name </i>character designer <b>Masayoshi Tanaka</b> also worked on this new film and was joined by <b>Atsushi Tamura</b>, who served as animation director, and <b>Hiroshi Takiguchi</b>, who served as art director. </p>
      <p>GKIDS has also announced that the movie will be released in U.S. theaters on January 17th, 2020, but there will be preview nights thanks to Fathom Events on January 15-16.</p>
