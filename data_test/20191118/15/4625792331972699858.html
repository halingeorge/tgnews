      <h1>‘How dare you’: Navy SEAL who shot bin Laden slams Biden for saying Trump is ‘not fit to command’ troops</h1>

      <p>Former Navy SEAL Robert O’Neill leveled former Vice President Joe Biden after he claimed that President Trump is “not fit” to be commander in chief.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Biden, 76, tweeted about Trump’s decision to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-clears-three-military-members-accused-of-war-crimes"><u>clear three military members</u></a> who had been accused or convicted of war crimes. The president pardoned Army Special Forces Maj. Mathew Golsteyn and Army Lt. Clint Lorance and restored the rank of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher. Their crimes included killing a suspected Taliban bomb maker, taking photographs of an Islamic State fighter's corpse, and killing two civilians.</p>
      <p>Trump claimed he intervened because he wants Americans fighting overseas to have the “confidence to fight.” Biden claimed Trump’s decision “betrayed the rule of law” and those who fight honorably.</p>
      <p>O’Neill, who claims he was the SEAL responsible for killing Osama bin Laden, shot down the 2020 Democrat's tweet by highlighting his own foreign policy flaws. He noted that Biden reportedly opposed <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/from-dont-go-to-go-joe-biden-has-told-opposite-stories-about-his-role-in-the-osama-bin-laden-raid"><u>the 2011 raid to kill bin Laden</u></a> and that he announced SEAL Team 6 was responsible for the operation.</p>

      <p>Some believed Biden’s admission that it was SEAL Team 6 <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/mother-of-fallen-seal-team-6-member-blames-wh-leaks-for-her-sons-death">put a target on their backs</a></u> that resulted in the attack on one of the team’s helicopters, which killed some who participated in the raid.</p>

      <p>O’Neill has spread his criticisms of political leaders across the aisle. He called Trump’s plans for a military parade <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/navy-seal-who-says-he-killed-osama-bin-laden-trumps-military-parade-is-third-world-bullshit">“third world bullshit.”</a></u></p>
