      <h1>Hiding Behind Parkinson’s Disease</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:00:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sherri Woodbridge</a></address>
      <p>We often try to hide from the world when we feel inadequate, abnormal, or different. It’s a natural defense that can be destructive when it leads to feelings of shame.</p>
      <p>Shame is an emotion we would rather avoid. It can come upon us unexpectedly. We tend to associate it with feelings of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6700625/">inadequacy</a> or a poor self-image.</p>
      <h3>Odd but true</h3>
      <p>It might seem odd to think a disease would cause you to feel shame. With Parkinson’s disease, our bodies change as they become more rigid. They become more difficult for us to manage and we must rely on help from others. The lack of independence can be humiliating and lead to feelings of shame.</p>
      <p>Negative feelings about our appearance or our capabilities affect our expectations. When <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/intense-emotions-and-strong-feelings/201104/shame-concealed-contagious-and-dangerous-emotion">shame is present</a>, we fear being judged harshly. You feel as if you have breached an unspoken code of conduct for what others view as acceptable behavior in public.</p>
      <p>We put pressure on ourselves by believing you have to walk a certain way, talk a certain way, and move a certain way to be normal. For someone with Parkinson’s disease, it might be impossible to live up to the code. It is easy to fall into the trap of feeling worthless and as if we have nothing to offer just because we have Parkinson’s. We can feel small and unimportant, and we may want to disappear.</p>
      <p>I was talking to a neighbor one day and my hand began to shake quite a bit. She asked, “What’s the matter with you? Am I making you that nervous?” The way she asked was embarrassing for me. But that was the day she found out I had Parkinson’s disease.</p>
      <h3>Take off the mask</h3>
      <p>We want to hide because of how our disease makes <i>us</i> feel. Others want to hide from us because of how our abnormalities make <i>them</i> feel. It is uncomfortable for both sides. People don’t always know how to approach someone with Parkinson’s disease. They don’t know what to say or how to respond.</p>
      <p>Don’t be embarrassed the next time you find yourself in a situation where someone is uncomfortable because of how you walk or talk. Enlighten them about the disease. Take off the mask of fear and shame and <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2019/10/14/burden-online-community-independence/">let others see you</a>. There’s no reason for you to be ashamed.</p>
