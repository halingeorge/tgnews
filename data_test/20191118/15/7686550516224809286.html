      <h1>A candidate to be a Labour MP wrote 'emotional and steamy' bondage novels</h1>
      <h2>Steffie Williams Roberts writes under a pen name and her books are described as being 'steamier than Fifty Shades'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:55:34+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Lydia Morris</a></address>
      <p>A Labour Parliamentary hopeful is a former beauty pageant contestant and also the author of bondage novels.</p>
      <p>Steffie Williams Roberts, 27, wants to be MP for Arfon - a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-candidates-arfon-16891858">constituency which most recently returned a Plaid Cymru MP.</a></p>
      <p>She writes under the pen name Steffie Dawn and has produced a number of racy books that have been in the Amazon Erotica Top 10, <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/labour-woman-bidding-north-wales-17258167">according to North Wales Live.</a></p>
      <p>They focus on BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadism and Masochism). Her seven-part series, A Week With My Romanian was published in 2013.</p>
      <p>It follows a submissive who has been sharing an online relationship with an Eastern European dominant.</p>
      <p>The first - Meeting My Master - shot to number three on the Amazon Erotica Bestseller List within six weeks.</p>
      <p>One reviewer wrote: "This book is emotional and very steamy. It's not for you if you are prudish! This book made my eyes bug out and my mouth drop open several times. You better get on board the 'Romanian Master Train'."</p>

      <p>Step-mother-of-two Steffie, who lives with her wife in Bangor, said her work was a "hobby that will always be part of me".</p>
      <p>She added: "I enjoy expressing myself."</p>
      <p>Born in Rhiwlas, <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/all-about/bangor">Bangor</a> , Mrs Williams Roberts grew up on the Maesgeirchen Estate and studied Law at university before joining the Labour party in 2015.</p>
      <p>She says her priority policy is to ensure there is fairer funding in Wales in the future.</p>
      <p>"It's time for real change. I've seen public services starved of money over the years," she said.</p>
      <p>"I want to see fairer funding for Wales in places with higher rates of poverty and unemployability.</p>
      <p>"It's all about opportunities, youth and life chances. We need proper funding for Wales.</p>
      <p>"I'm a real change for Arfon - I'm a stronger and newer voice."</p>
