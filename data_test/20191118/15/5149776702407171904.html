      <h1>Man 'running across the A52' detained after police called to burglary</h1>
      <h2>Police dogs were deployed</h2>

      <p>A police helicopter and force dogs were deployed on Sunday evening (November 17) after a burglary.</p>
      <p>Detectives were called to reports of a house burglary in Ruddington Lane, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Wilford</a>, at about 7.45pm that day.</p>
      <p>A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said: "Officers saw a man flee over the garden fence when they arrived.</p>
      <p>"The police helicopter later identified a man running across the A52, who was detained by officers."</p>
      <p>A 28-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident.</p>
      <p>The arrested man is also being questioned in connection with a number of other burglaries in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire</a> over the past month.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Kayne Rukas, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police's</a> burglary team, said: "Burglaries have a big impact on families and the thought of a stranger coming into their homes can be extremely distressing.</p>
      <p>"The force recognises the seriousness of burglary, which is why we have dedicated burglary teams covering the city and county.</p>
      <p>"This arrest follows a swift response and a coordinated action between officers on the ground, the dog section and the police helicopter."</p>
