      <h1>Celtic’s asking price too high for one club – And player not first choice for another two sides</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:33:56+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Claims from the UK of Crystal Palace interest in Odsonne Edouard have led <a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/357046/calciomercato_napoli_e_roma_pericolo_inglese_per_edouard">Calciomercato</a> to put out a report explaining where Serie A sides stand for the Celtic player.</p>
      <p>It’s been reported repeatedly that there’s Italian interest in the striker, with claims he’s been watched in action for Celtic.</p>
      <p>Twelve goals and the same number of assists so far this season are statistics which have attracted attention to the 21 year old, but it doesn’t seem like there’s going to be an Italian bidding war for him in the coming windows.</p>
      <p>Calciomercato name the interested sides as Lazio, AS Roma and Napoli.</p>
      <p>For Lazio, it’s stated Celtic’s asking price is too high, although no figure is attached to that.</p>
      <p>When it comes to Roma, they would be better placed to pay what the Scottish Premiership champions are looking for, however, Edouard isn’t near the top of their wanted list.</p>
      <p>Napoli have concerns over the fitness of their strikers, yet it’s stated they’d be likelier to try and sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a free transfer than go for the Celtic option.</p>
