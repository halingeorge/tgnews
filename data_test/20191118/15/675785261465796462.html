      <p>England face the daunting prospect of a Euro 2020 group including France and Portugal.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate recently said his Three Lions side were "further ahead" than when they headed to Russia last year and he will need that to be the case if England draw the World Champions and the European Champions.</p>
      <p>UEFA's interesting system could see France in pot 2, Portugal in pot 3 and England with a nervous wait.</p>
      <p>Southgate's side have assured themselves of a place in the top bracket alongside Belgium, Italy and Ukraine.</p>

      <p>The 24 teams who qualify for Euro 2020 are seeded based on their qualifying performance with the ten group winners taking the top ten slots.</p>
      <p>France are currently seeded fifth but can be overtaken by Spain, should they beat Sweden, and Germany, who only need a point against Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>It would leave them as the seventh seed and in the second pot, which includes a mixture of group winners and the leading runners up, for the group stage</p>

      <p>The second pot will include Croatia, Poland and Russia with the others still to be determined.</p>
      <p>France lost the final on home soil the last time Europe's elite international side came together four years ago.</p>
      <p>Portugal and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> , who toppled them in 2016, currently find themselves in the second pot, but only for the moment as they wait on the result of Holland's home game with Estonia.</p>
      <p>A Dutch win would demote the current European Champions into pot three where they would be joined by Turkey, Austria and the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>The remaining pot four has several outcomes still live with the Republic of Ireland and Wales still in with a chance of a play-off match.</p>
      <p>The draw for the tournament, which will take place in 12 venues across Europe, is made in the Bucharest on November 30.</p>
