      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:46:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Amber Hicks, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jodie-chesney">Jodie Chesney's</a> killers have been jailed for murdering the innocent Girl Scout in an "ambush" as she hung out with her boyfriend and pals in a park.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old student was killed in a case of 'mistaken identity' when she was stabbed in the back while sitting on a bench in Harold Hill, east London.</p>
      <p>Two drug dealers - Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and Arron Isaacs, 17 - were found guilty of murder after jurors heard the pair were involved in a violent turf war before the unprovoked attack.</p>
      <p>Ong-a-Kwie was today jailed for life and must serve a minimum of 26 years in prison.</p>
      <p>While Isaacs - who was named for the first time this afternoon after a judge lifted a court order - was locked up for a minimum term of 18 years.</p>

      <p>Jodie suffered an 18cm (7in) deep stab wound, which almost passed right through her body in the horrific attack.</p>
      <p>She collapsed into her boyfriend Eddie Coyle's arms before dying as the killers ran off into the darkness on the evening of March 1.</p>
      <p>Sentencing, Judge Wendy Joseph said: "What is important is that a blameless girl is dead at the hands of those engaged in and those that associate with drug dealing on the streets which Jodie and other blameless young people must live.</p>
      <p>"This death has brought great unease in the community. Those suffering, which spreads much further than Jodie's friends and family, need and have a right to known and understand how this has come about."</p>

      <p>Addressing the defendants, she continued: "One of you plunged a knife into Jodie's back.</p>
      <p>"Jodie screamed until she could scream no more."</p>
      <p>Jodie's family and friends tied purple ribbons - her favourite colour - to posts outside the Old Bailey before Ong-a-Kwie and Isaacs were sentenced.</p>
      <p>They had denied murder but were convicted on November 7 after a jury deliberated for nearly six hours.</p>
      <p>Two co-defendants - Manuel Petrovic, 20, and a 16-year-old boy - were cleared of murder.</p>
      <p>In a victim impact statement read out today on behalf of Jodie's boyfriend Eddie Coyle, he said: "Jodie was funny, silly, she always made fun of me and she had a bright future ahead of her.</p>
      <p>"She was full of energy and was always out doing something. We had been going out for three months.</p>
      <p>"I've never lost anyone before and for the first funeral I've gone to, to be my own girlfriend's is incredibly hard. I loved her."</p>

      <p>Jodie's sister Lucy Chesney also described the impact of her loss.</p>
      <p>She said in a statement: “I’m only 20 years old and already I’m dreading my life rather than looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>"Losing her is like losing half of myself. We went through everything together and she was always there for me and always putting everyone before herself. She gave me a type of love I will never feel again."</p>
      <p>She added: "Jodie will be greatly missed and the people who caused such tragedy to a whole family should hang their head in shame. You have ripped away a bright future that was destined to make a change to many lives."</p>

      <p>Jodie's uncle Dave Chesney, a Church of England minister, admitted that conducting her funeral was the hardest thing he had ever done.</p>
      <p>He said he was on a long "journey of forgiveness" which threatened to overshadow the rest of his life and work.</p>
      <p>On the defendants' conduct in court, he said: "It had been weeks of denial and blame all for the intention of self preservation."</p>
      <p>He added: "We are a broken family still coming to terms with the loss of a beautiful soul."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Although the motive for the murder was unclear, the court was told how the defendants had been involved in violent clashes as they fought to protect their turf.</p>
      <p>The trial heard Jodie became a victim of “casual violence” in the drug-dealing world where knife violence was "routine", and the Met Police later said the "girl next door" was stabbed "for no reason".</p>
      <p>The Girl Scout and her friends had been smoking cannabis and listening to music in Amy's Park when she was fatally stabbed from behind.</p>

      <p>Giving evidence, grief-stricken Mr Coyle, 18, fought back tears as he told jurors how one of the attackers - said to be 6ft 2in Ong-a-Kwie - swung his right arm and knifed Jodie.</p>
      <p>Mr Coyle caught her as she fell off the bench and cried out for help as he held his dying girlfriend in his arms.</p>
      <p>Jodie - who had once visited Downing Street with the Girl Scouts - screamed and lost consciousness in front of her horrified friends as paramedics and police raced to the scene.</p>
      <p>By the time an ambulance arrived, she showed no signs of life and was pronounced dead about an hour later on the forecourt of a petrol station.</p>

      <p>Doctors had met the ambulance while it was en route to a hospital and performed emergency surgery in an attempt to get Jodie’s heart beating again.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC had told jurors the defendants took a “casual approach to violence” in a world where knife crime was “routine”, and he described the unprovoked attack as an "ambush".</p>
      <p>The court had heard how Ong-a-Kwie had been knifed in the thigh six months before and was on the lookout for his assailants on the day of the murder.</p>
      <p>Police said at least three knives had been seized during the investigation but none was confirmed as the murder weapon.</p>

      <p>On the evening of March 1, Petrovic had driven the defendants to the park after Ong-a-Kwie sent an urgent request for a lift, jurors were told.</p>
      <p>Petrovic did a U-turn, turned off his headlights and waited in the car with the 16-year-old defendant as Ong-a-Kwie and Isaacs ran in armed with a knife.</p>
      <p>Chilling CCTV captured the shadowy figures of Ong-a-Kwie and Isaacs disappearing into the park before the sounds of Jodie screaming could be heard.</p>
      <p>The case was cracked after a motorist came forward to report Petrovic’s Corsa in a road nearby.</p>

      <p>It was connected to a separate incident later that night when Petrovic was forced to abandon the car in the street after being robbed at knifepoint, jurors heard.</p>
      <p>In the coming days, police seized key CCTV and phone evidence linking Petrovic to the rest of the defendants, who turned on each other at their Old Bailey trial, although the 16-year-old declined to give evidence.</p>
      <p>Petrovic said he knew nothing of what was about to happen in the park.</p>
      <p>Ong-a-Kwie admitted being in the park but claimed Isaacs had stabbed Jodie, thinking she was a youth called “Tash”.</p>
      <p>In turn, Isaacs said Ong-a-Kwie was responsible and had even confessed that he “messed up” before disposing on the knife and burning his clothes.</p>

      <p>After the murder, purple ribbons were tied to posts, signs and trees at the scene of the murder and across parts of east London to pay tribute to Jodie.</p>
      <p>They were tied to posts outside the Old Bailey during the trial.</p>
      <p>Jodie's father, Peter, was celebrating his birthday in London when his daughter was killed.</p>
      <p>He has since launched the Jodie Chesney Foundation to combat the UK's knife crime epidemic.</p>
      <p>Reading out a statement to court, Jodie's cousin Lauren Chesney said her loss had left their family "broken".</p>
      <p>She said: "As a family, we are broken. There will now be a constant missing piece from our family unit that will never be the same.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>"Each one of us brings something to the table and Jodie had so much more to give, we will never know what now.</p>
      <p>"We may carry on living, carry on working, carry on doing things that normal people do, but our lives will never be normal, not without Jodie."</p>
      <p>DCI Whellams said after the sentencing:<b> </b>“This has been a long and traumatic process for Jodie’s family, and today marks the start of years of imprisonment for her killers.</p>
      <p>“Jodie’s life was ended in the most brutal way by Svenson Ong-A- Kwie and Aaron Isaacs, and I hope her family and friends feel some measure of justice has been served.</p>
      <p>“On that Friday in March, Jodie was not in the wrong place at the wrong time, she was simply living her life as a teenager should - carefree and with her friends."</p>
