      <p>Starting next year the <b>fine</b> for throwing a cigarette butt in <b>Brussels</b> will be increased from 50 to 200 euros, according to the mayoralty of the Belgian capital.</p>
      <p>The city's cleanliness office is launching a plan to raise awareness among smokers, install urban ashtrays, as well as to launch a project for the utilisation of  <b>cigarette butts</b> via pocket ashtrays, the service said.</p>
      <p>Hard measures are explained by the municipal authorities with the fact that almost one third of the municipal waste collected by the municipal services are cigarette butts.</p>
      <p>It takes 15 years for a  cigarette butt to decompose and also contains many toxic substances. The mayor states that only one cigarette butt can contaminate 500 liters of water.</p>
