      <p>“There’s a lack of transparency on the part of the State government in conducting the local body elections,” said R. Mutharasan, State secretary of Communist Party of India, here on Monday.</p>
      <p>A three-day camp was held in Veerapandi near here in which party functionaries from Madurai, Theni and Dindigul districts took part and discussions were held on contesting in the local body polls.</p>
      <p>“The sudden shunting of Election Commissioner and transfers of district election-officers raise eyebrows about the intentions of the ruling party. The election should be conducted in a fair and democratic manner,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added that the five newly carved-out districts should be properly divided into taluks and wards for the local body elections to take place in a proper manner.</p>
      <p>“The lack of local administrative bodies had led to rampant corruption and swindling of public money. Lots of grassroots level problems have not been addressed,” he said.</p>
