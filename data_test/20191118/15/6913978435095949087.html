      <p><b>BERLIN —</b> Berlin on Monday urged Iran to respect the "legitimate" protests against a petrol price hike and open talks with the demonstrators.<br/><br/>"It is legitimate and deserving of our respect when people courageously air their economic and political grievances, as is currently happening in Iran," said Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer.<br/><br/>"The Iranian government should respond to the current protests with a willingness to engage in dialogue," she told a regular press conference, adding that Germany was following the events "with concern".<br/><br/>"We urge the government in Tehran to respect freedom of assembly and expression."<br/><br/>The French foreign ministry separately said it was "closely following" the events in Iran.<br/><br/>France reiterates the need "to respect freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest," a foreign ministry spokeswoman said.<br/><br/>At least two people have died in violent riots in Iran since Friday, sparked by a decision to impose petrol price hikes and rationing in the sanctions-hit country.<br/><br/>Major roads have been blocked, banks torched and public buildings attacked in the nationwide unrest.<br/><br/>Footage of the violence showing masked young men on debris-strewn streets setting buildings ablaze has been aired on state television, which rarely shows any signs of dissent in the country.<br/><br/>Germany on Sunday tightened its travel advice for Iran, warning citizens to avoid demonstrations and large gatherings and refrain from expressing political opinions to strangers. — AFP</p>
