      <h1>Catalan president on trial for attaching yellow pro-independence ribbons to public buildings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:39:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/james-badcock/" target="_blank">James Badcock</a></address>
      <p>Catalonia's president Quim Torra stood trial on Monday on a charge of disobedience for refusing an order to pull down yellow ribbons attached to Catalan government buildings in solidarity with jailed politicians.</p>
      <p>If found guilty, Mr Torra could be barred from public office for up to two years, which would almost certainly trigger fresh elections in Catalonia and potentially deepen the political crisis in Spain.</p>
      <p>Ahead of national, local and European elections held in Spain in April and May, the country’s electoral board ordered the removal of the ribbons deemed supportive of pro-independence parties.</p>
      <p>The ribbons paid tribute to nine politicians jailed for holding an unlawful referendum in 2017.</p>
      <p>Answering a member of his defence team, Mr Torra admitted that he had disobeyed the electoral board because it was, he claimed, an “illegal order” and “censorship”.</p>

      <p>Mr Torra, who said on the eve of the trial that he was not going to defend himself but rather “attack the Spanish state for violating its own rights and those of all Catalans”, argued that Spain’s central electoral board, made up of judges and academics, did not have authority over the president of Catalonia.</p>
      <p>Mr Torra refused to answer questions from the public prosecutor and the private prosecution by hard-Right party Vox, which won a shock 52 seats out of 350 in last week’s general election.</p>
      <p>In what at times sounded more like a political speech than testimony, Mr Torra said: “We are a democratic people, and we don’t understand how the people’s leaders can be subject to the penal code”.</p>
      <p>Mr Torra’s defence asked unsuccessfully for the trial in Catalonia’s high court to be abandoned alleging bias on the part of the panel’s chief judge, who has made public statements in support of the electoral board’s rulings on the ribbons.</p>
      <p>If Mr Torra is found guilty, he can appeal to Spain’s supreme court and at least avoid the bar on public office being imposed until 2020.</p>
      <p>Mr Torra, a close political ally of Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan president who moved to Belgium to avoid being tried for sedition, has demanded that Spanish acting-Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez offer talks on a self-determination referendum in Catalonia overseen by an international mediator.</p>
      <p>Following last week’s elections, Socialist leader Mr Sánchez needs the support of some Catalan parties in his bid to form a minority government with Left-wing party Podemos.</p>
