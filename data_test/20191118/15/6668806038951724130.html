      <p>Abhishek played Rajkummar Rao’s friend in Stree and won over viewer's with his comic timing. Now he's stepping into this rom-com and he seems to be  excited about the same. The actor spoke to an entertainment portal and said that he’s glad to be a part of this Dharma film. He’s initially worked with Collin D’Cunha (director of Dostana 2) as casting director for Secret Superstar. He couldn’t believe that life has come full circle. </p>

      <p>Abhishek was last seen in Bala as Ayushmann’s friend cum barber and he sure tickcled our bones in the superhit film. Here’s look forward to more from this budding actor. </p>
