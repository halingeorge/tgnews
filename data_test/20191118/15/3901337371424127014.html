      <p>A win against Egypt would earn Mzansi a place in next year’s Tokyo Summer Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>“We have played against this side twice before in our two friendly matches building up to this tournament and we know what to expect from them. We also profiled each player in our analysis sessions and you can be rest assured that the boys are hungry to push for a win in this one. Our goal is to qualify for next year’s Olympic Games, and we will stop at nothing until we achieve that goal,” said Malepe, as quoted on SAFA’s official website.</p>

      <p>Malepe played at the previous Olympics Games in Rio in 2016.</p>
      <p>“Playing in the 2016 Olympic Games was a good experience for me and my only wish is to see my teammates gaining the same experience as well. We have been speaking about it and everybody is just highly motivated to realise this goal. Not everybody gets the opportunity to feature in two back-to-back Olympics games and this is one opportunity I really do not want to miss in my playing career. I am just grateful to be playing with guys who share the common vision of being among the top three teams that will represent Africa in Tokyo, come next year,” the Chippa United defender added. </p>
