        <b>Macca's heading to Worthy Farm!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emily Eavis has now confirmed that <a href="http://nme.com/artists/paul-mccartney">Paul McCartney</a> will headline <a href="http://nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> next year.</p>
      <p>The news comes just hours after the <a href="http://nme.com/artists/beatles">Beatles</a> icon seemingly confirmed that he will headline the festival next year, after sharing a cryptic clue on his Twitter account.</p>
      <p>Macca shared an image of American composer Philip Glass, actress Emma Stone and rock legend Chuck Berry. When the surnames of all three are combined, the not-so-subtle clue of “Glass-Stone-Bury” is provided.</p>
      <p>Eavis wrote: “IT’S REAL!! So excited.. Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true. There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary.”</p>
      <p>McCartney has now also confirmed the news, writing: “Hey Glasto – excited to be part of your Anniversary celebrations. See ya next summer!”</p>
      <p>It ends months of speculation surrounding a headline slot for Macca at Glastonbury’s fiftieth anniversary next year.</p>

      <p>In April, founder Michael Eavis seemingly let slip that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/glastonbury-2020-headliner-rumour-paul-mccartney-2474759">McCartney would be coming to Glastonbury</a>, “Hopefully for the 50th. Don’t make a big thing of it though, will you?” he told the BBC.</p>
      <p>McCartney himself later <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/paul-mccartney-says-glastonbury-2020-remote-possibility-2545078">admitted that a headline slot was a “distinct possibility”.</a></p>
      <p>“My kids are saying ‘Dad we’ve got to talk about Glastonbury’ and I think I know what they mean,” he told Zoe Ball’s Breakfast Show in September.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“So they go every year, like a lot of people these days, and it is a great festival and we played there quite a long time ago so, maybe it is time to go back, I don’t know, I’d have to put a few things in place and try and do that but it’s starting to become some sort of remote possibility.</p>
