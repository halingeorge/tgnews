      <p>With a job as a stock market trader, Andre Baldeo, 45, was making a good wage and he thought he was happy.</p>
      <p>But when he realised he was just trapped in the daily grind, he decided to uproot his whole family and travel the world.</p>
      <p>In a bid to show kids, Rico, 12, and Tiana-Mae, ten, there was ‘more to life than suburbia’, he convinced wife Becky, 44, to quit their jobs and sell their house.</p>
      <p>They sold their belongings and bought a one-way ticket for an 18-month trip of a lifetime.</p>
      <p>They travelled 51,000 miles across 13 countries in South America and Asia, visiting 48 cities, staying in hotels, youth hostels and jungle lodges.</p>
      <p>They swapped days at school and work for stints conserving turtles, working on farms and even football coaching, ‘home-schooling’ the kids along the way.</p>
      <p>Now back home they are unemployed and living in rented accommodation – but said the £65,000 trip was worth every penny.</p>

      <p>Andre, from Enfield, north London, said: ‘It was time for a change and I rehashed one of my life long dreams to Becky – to travel the world and experience as much as we could as a family of four.</p>

      <p>‘It really hit home how we have to make the most of our lives.</p>
      <p>‘Working long hours stuck in front of six monitor screens, studying graphs and looking at news can become very lonely and extremely depressing. It became suffocating.</p>
      <p>‘It was completely life-changing and incredibly inspiring but it was the scariest thing I’ve ever had to do.</p>

      <p>‘We broke down all the security we had at home and gave up everything.</p>
      <p>‘I do feel proud to have done it and it is the best £65,000 I have ever spent.</p>
      <p>‘We now have the most amazing memories to keep forever and nothing will change that.</p>
      <p>‘I gave up our family home and I don’t regret it for a second.</p>

      <p>‘It was the trip of a lifetime and coming back home has been very strange. It’s going to take a while for us to get used to normal life again.</p>
      <p>‘I know when on my deathbed, I’ll have a head full of amazing experiences and memories and won’t have any regrets to what we sacrificed to make them happen.’</p>
      <p>Andre and Becky met in London, where he was working as a trader and Becky as a PA.</p>
      <p>They moved to Cape Town in South Africa, where Becky was from in 2007.</p>

      <p>Rico and Tiana-Mae came along and the family had a comfortable lifestyle with Andre earning around £35,000 a year.</p>

      <p>But in September 2016, Andre said he realised he was sick of this rut and he started to think about making a change.</p>
      <p>He finally decided to change his life when he heard a close friend in the UK who had a brain tumour had been given a matter of weeks to live.</p>
      <p>During 18 months of planning, they sold their Cape Town home and put all their belongings into storage.</p>

      <p>When they set off, they had no idea how long it would last but they started with a one-way flight to Sarawak, in Borneo, in April 2018.</p>
      <p>Andre said they planned their route as they went along, including trips to Thailand, Vietnam and Japan.</p>
      <p>‘Another volunteering opportunity arose in Japan, this time for me to dust of my boots and help to coach football at an academy”, said Andre.</p>
      <p>‘We lived with a Japanese family who had three small children.</p>

      <p>‘Food and board were provided in exchange for our help – me coaching football, and Becky helping around the house.</p>
      <p>‘Christmas was spent in Tokyo with an old friend of mine and his family, from my home town Enfield, North London.’</p>
      <p>In February the family flew to Colombia and spent five weeks working at a foundation with local children.</p>
      <p>After two months they flew to Ecuador for three weeks walking up volcanoes, exploring the Amazon and hiking in the Andes.</p>

      <p>The last leg of the journey took the Baldeo’s down the eastern side of South America with visits to Peru, Bolivia and Chile.</p>

      <p>Their last calling point was San Jose, in Costa Rica, where they boarded a plane back home, arriving back in Cape Town on October 29.</p>
      <p>The family had an amazing time but Andrew says it wasn’t always easy.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘A lot of people think that this way of life is glamorous and essentially a glorified holiday.</p>

      <p>‘It is very difficult being together, just the four of us 24/7. No one gets any personal space at all.</p>
      <p>‘My guilty pleasure when we packed our rucksacks to come away was my running shoes, so thankfully I got away for some time alone a few times a week.</p>
      <p>‘Becky’s guilty pleasure was her hair straighteners – but she has only used them once.</p>

      <p>‘To be honest living out of bags, having cold showers, long bus journeys and constantly moving and not having familiar surroundings got draining.</p>
      <p>‘But the amazing experiences that we had to cancel out the negatives.</p>
      <p>‘We realised we were coming towards the end after about a year and four months.</p>
      <p>‘We were getting very tired and planned our way back home.’</p>
