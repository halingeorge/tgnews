      <p>MINSKL Candidates loyal to Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko have swept to victory in parliamentary elections, results showed Monday (Nov 18), with the opposition failing to take a single seat.</p>
      <p>Critics had already denounced Sunday's vote as a fraud and said it was rife with violations, despite Lukashenko's recent efforts to reach out to the West.</p>

      <p>Official results released Monday showed parties loyal to Lukashenko taking all 110 seats in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of a parliament dubbed a rubber stamp by critics.</p>
      <p>The opposition had previously held two seats in the chamber.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old Lukashenko - who has been dubbed "Europe's last dictator" -Â has ruled the ex-Soviet nation since 1994 and overseen a series of elections that international observers have deemed unfair.</p>
      <p>The country is set to hold a presidential election next year and as he cast his ballot on Sunday Lukashenko confirmed he would again be a candidate.</p>
      <p>He said he understood that Western countries would be watching the parliamentary vote but that it was Belarusians who would have the last word.</p>
      <p>"We hold this vote in our country for our people, to make things better, and we hold it in the way we understand."</p>
      <p>Those critical of Lukashenko faced little choice at the ballot box, with the main opposition leaders and the only two current opposition MPs barred from standing.</p>
      <p>An election monitoring campaign organised by opposition parties reported multiple violations on voting day, including officials inflating voter numbers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>REACHING OUT TO THE WEST</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rights activists monitoring the vote complained observers were thrown out, banned from taking photographs and had their view blocked.</p>
      <p>According to the authorities, more than 35 per cent of the 6.8 million electorate voted ahead of polling day. Turnout reached 77 per cent, according to the official results.</p>
      <p>In recent months Lukashenko has been making renewed attempts to reach out to Western nations, which have been critical of his record on human rights and democracy.</p>
      <p>He made a rare visit to western Europe this month, meeting Austrian leaders in Vienna and saying he wanted the European Union to be "an important political and business partner" for his country.</p>
      <p>He also hosted then White House national security advisor John Bolton for rare talks in Minsk in August, saying a "new chapter" was opening in ties with Washington.</p>
      <p>Lukashenko is seeking a counterweight in relations with giant neighbour Russia, which is keen to ensure Belarus remains in its sphere of influence.</p>
      <p>The countries have formed a nominal "union", with close trade and military cooperation, but Lukashenko has opposed outright unification.</p>
      <p>EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic has said the bloc was watching Sunday's election closely.</p>
      <p>But there was little optimism among foreign observers for a more democratic vote.</p>
      <p>People did not expect polls to be "genuinely competitive" and "had little confidence in the process", the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an international election and war monitor, said in a preliminary report.</p>
