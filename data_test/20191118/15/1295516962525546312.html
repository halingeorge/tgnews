      <h1>In Defense of ‘Filler’ Episodes In Anime</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:11:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Gramuglia</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/anime/">Anime</a> filler is far less common, ever since anime studios adapted a seasonal rotation system. However, back in the day, filler proved to be the theoretical bane of fans' existence. Every major shonen anime, at some point or another, reached the dreaded "filler arc" when the anime finally caught up to the manga. Manga chapters take time to produce. There are shortcuts animators can take to get episodes out on a consistent, fast level, and, when you produce <a href="https://screenrant.com/most-underrated-anime/amp/">anime</a> for a weekly, almost constant basis, you get a lot of filler. For the most part, people hate filler.</p>
      <p>However, here is a radical statement: filler is not always bad. Sometimes, it's a great opportunity to explore characters and ideas that might otherwise be left unexplored.</p>

      <h3>Why is Filler Hated?</h3>

      <p>Manga is often created as a singular vision, with one viewpoint guiding it directly. When you deviate off that path, sometimes things fall apart and go unfocused. In <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/bleach/"><i>Bleach</i></a>, following the Soul Society Arc, where the murder victim Aizen is revealed to be both not dead and the series's big bad, the manga transitions straight into the Arrancar Arc, continuing Aizen's warpath on existence. In the anime, however, we transition into the Bount Arc and the Bount Assault Arc, a two-season filler arc lasting 28 episodes and 18 episodes, respectfully. That's a huge period of time devoted to something that won't be relevant once we return to the core plot of the anime. Keep in mind, at this point, <i>Bleach</i> was only roughly 63 episodes long before the Bount Arc, meaning that, by the time the Arrancar Arc rolled around in Season 6, slightly less than half of the entire series consisted of filler. That barely compares to the legendary hundreds of filler episodes throughout <i>Naruto</i>'s run.</p>

      <p>In other cases, anime can be canceled because filler is less interesting than the material from the manga. <i>Rurouni Kenshin</i>, one of the most beloved shonen manga of all time, ended up having its anime adaptation canceled after the third arc, which consisted of filler material. This arc was of such a lower quality that audiences lost interest, and the anime ended, never adapting the real third arc of the manga, which many fans of the manga consider to be one of the highlights of the entire series.</p>
      <p>Modern anime have avoided anime filler for the most part. <i>Dragon Ball Z Kai</i>, for example, is a re-release of the original anime with the filler material taken out, resulting in a faster-paced, leaner series. Anime like <i>My Hero Academia</i> and <i>Attack on Titan</i> rely on seasons with long hiatuses between to avoid resorting to fillers to allow the manga to go ahead. When modern anime include filler, such as <i>Black Clover</i>, it draws criticism from fans almost immediately.</p>
      <h3>But is Filler Material All Bad?</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Not all filler is bad. Though it might not be as good as the material produced in the manga, it can supplement that material when done well. The original 2003 iteration of <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i> is considered inferior to the more manga-faithful <i>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</i> -- and rightfully so. With only a third of the manga completed at the time of the original series, the original anime had to spin off its own narrative mostly on its own. However, until the more faithful adaptation was released, many fans hailed <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i> as a triumph.</p>

      <p>One aspect the original anime had over its later remake is that it took time to develop its characters further. When we are introduced to Shou Tucker and his daughter Nina in <i>Brotherhood</i>, we are introduced to both of them and learn what happens to them in the same episode. In the original series, this plot is dragged out further, giving audiences time to grow attached to both of them before...<i>that</i> scene happens.</p>
      <p>The same is true for Maes Hughes. Maes Hughes appears for ten episodes in <i>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</i> before being very famously killed off. Hughes's death in the original series happens in episode 25. While both series establish Hughes as a lovable dork, it's undeniable that the longer we spend with Hughes, the more attached we as audience members become to him.</p>
      <h3>Some Filler Arcs Are Enjoyable</h3>

      <p>While many filler arcs are of a subpar nature, many others are less bad. Some are even fun. While the filler arcs that led to Rurouni Kenshin's cancellation were weaker than the Kyoto Arc that preceded it, Season 3 isn't by any means bad. It's a step-down, certainly, but the arcs present some fascinating concepts. Most notably, the Christian cult, which draws heavily from the historical Shimabara Rebellion. The ending is also fitting for the series -- arguably, far more fitting than the <i>Samurai X: Reflection</i> movie.</p>

      <p>Returning to <i>Dragon Ball</i>, while many fans decry the Garlic Jr. saga as weak and unimportant filler, it's undeniable that not all its filler is equally reviled. One arc that stands out as particularly good is <i>Dragon Ball</i>'s final five episodes, where Goku and Chi-Chi go on an adventure to retrieve a magical fan to stop a fire burning up the Ox King's house. The arc is undeniably filler, but it offers fans something we never saw before or since: Goku and Chi-Chi going on an adventure as a married couple together. The manga never really presented Chi-Chi as much more than Goku's aggressive wife, but this offers us a different perspective of Chi-Chi that often gets overlooked by fans.</p>
      <h3>Some Filler Allows the Story to Change</h3>

        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eternal-Sailor-Moon-Widescreen-sailor-senshi-6346912-1680-1050.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=601&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>Not every anime needs to be a faithful adaptation. Aside from the 2003 <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i> series, another series that embraces filler is the original<i> Sailor Moon</i> anime. The anime only loosely adapted the original manga, often using it as an outline to take a divergent path on its own, creative accord. This led to ideas that became popular in and of themselves. Most of the episodes served as monster of the week stories that ultimately were mostly not present in the manga.</p>

      <p>While the Ali &amp; En Arc that opens the second season, <i>Sailor Moon R</i>, is obviously filler, it manages to bridge the first two seasons together in a necessary way, given the first season's ending. The same is true for the Nehelenia Arc in<i> Sailor Moon Stars</i>, which opens up the fifth season. This arc, in particular, is fondly remembered for its incredibly dramatic, powerful moments throughout. For a filler, the stakes feel raised, and it introduces the main villain of the Stars arc: Sailor Galaxia.</p>
      <p>But even many of the greatest moments of the anime outside of pure filler arcs are, in fact, filler. The entire subplot in the first arc of <i>Sailor Moon</i>'s anime between Naru and Nephrite is entirely an anime-original arc, yet it remains one of the most fondly remembered aspects of the anime. Due to its loose adaptation, it can spin-off with new plot concepts and ideas that are actually compelling in and of themselves.</p>
      <p>So while filler is less than fondly remembered, it isn't always bad. At least, when its used creatively and not 100 episodes of nonsense filler like in <i>Naruto</i>.</p>
