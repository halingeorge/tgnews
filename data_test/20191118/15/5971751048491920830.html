      <p>CES published the list of Honorees and Best of Innovation awarded devices for the <a href="https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2020/Honorees/N/Nokia-7-2.aspx">CES 2020 awards.</a> The good news is that Nokia 7.2 has been selected as a CES 2020 Innovation Awards honoree for its great design and camera and engineering qualities. Nokia 7.2 wasn’t alone on the list and the competition was pretty tough. CES also awarded Asus Rog Phone II, LG G8X ThinQ and others with the title of CES 2020 Awards honoree. The highest-rated product in the category of Mobile phones and accessories was given the Best of Innovation award. This year’s laureates in the category are Samsung with its great Galaxy Note 10+5G and OnePlus with its 7 Pro smartphone.</p>

      <p>It is good for the Nokia brand to be given the Honoree title since that will raise the visibility of the brand and help it spread at the US market. But, imagine if Nokia 7.2 came with a newer processor, 18W charger and maybe a Gorilla 5 glass, that would make this phone the best in the class. Anyway, this means (or maybe even confirms) that we’ll be seeing Nokia Mobile at CES2020 which is not that far away.</p>
