      <h2>Repeated extension of deadlines for submission of tenders also delays the process</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:25:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Suchith-Kidiyoor-15507/" target="_blank">Suchith Kidiyoor</a></address>
      <p>Karnataka’s wait for electric buses (e-buses) is yet to end with technical glitches in the e-procurement portal and frequent extension of deadlines for submission of tenders delaying the process.</p>
      <p>While glitches in e-procurement has delayed the leasing of 400 e-buses, the deadline for the submission of tenders has been extended eight times, inconveniencing bidders.</p>
      <p>The Union government had set November 15 as the deadline for the three transport corporations to issue a letter of approval to successful bidders and avail the subsidy under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles (FAME India II scheme).</p>
      <p>With fear of losing the subsidy, the corporations approached the Union government seeking extension of deadline citing technical glitches in the e-procurement portal. The government agreed to extend the deadline to issue letter of approval to December 15.</p>
      <p>A transport corporation official said: “Repeated technical glitches in e-procurement has jeopardised the entire tender process — not one or two times; the final date of submission of tender was auto extended eight times. The tender was floated on September 18 with a deadline for submission of tender by October 18. Owing to repeated glitches, finally the date was extended till November 18. The process has delayed leasing and operations of the e-buses in the State.”</p>
      <p>Under the FAME India II scheme, the State will get 400 e-buses, of which 300 will be leased by Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC). The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) will lease a fleet of 50 buses each. The KSRTC had floated tender on behalf of all the corporations.</p>
      <p>As per the specification fixed by the corporations, both BMTC and KSRTC will get 12-metre-long buses and NWKRTC is likely to operate nine-metre buses. As per the FAME India II scheme, a subsidy of ₹55 lakh will be provided to the longer buses and ₹45 lakh to the 9-metre ones.</p>
      <p>“We could have ended up losing crores of subsidy under the project owing to the long delay. Luckily, the Centre agreed to our request,” the official said.</p>
      <p>In FAME I scheme, the BMTC had missed the chance of using ₹75 crore subsidy as it failed to award tender within the stipulated time. The corporation had dropped the plan of leasing buses at a later stage citing that the financial interest of corporations was at stake. Leasing and operations of e-buses through a private party under FAME I was embroiled in controversy, as then Transport Minister D.C. Thammanna opposed the corporation’s move.</p>
      <p>As on Monday, the e-procurement portal indicated that the problem still persists. “Application is being upgraded to resolve technical issues. Hence, to manage the load on the system, tender closure dates have been distributed between November 15 and 30. Bidders are requested to check the date and time of closure of tenders in the e-procurement portal,” an announcement on the website said.</p>
