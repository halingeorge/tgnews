      <h1>Glastonbury 2020: Beatles legend Paul McCartney announced as Saturday night headliner</h1>
      <h2>He last headlined the festival in 2004</h2>

      <p>Sir Paul McCartney has been announced as the first headliner for Glastonbury 2020.</p>
      <p>The icon dropped a huge hint that he will be performing at the 50th anniversary of the festival with a cryptic tweet on his Twitter this morning.</p>
      <p>He posted an image of Philip Glass, Emma Stone and Chuck Berry next to each other, spelling out <i>Glass-Stone-Berry</i>.</p>
      <p>And just hours later, the festival tweeted to put an end to the ongoing rumours and confirm his appearance, writing: "We are incredibly excited to announce that Paul McCartney will headline the Pyramid Stage on the Saturday night of Glastonbury 2020."</p>
      <p>Festival founder Michael Eavis stoked the rumour mill back in April when he said he hoped Macca would play again, 'hopefully for the 50th.'</p>

      <p>And in September the former Beatle added to the speculation on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show, when he said: "People are saying that it will be good if I did it, so I'm starting to think about whether I can or whether it would be a good thing.</p>
      <p>"My kids are saying 'Dad, we've got to talk about <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/glastonbury-festival">Glastonbury</a>' and I think I know what they mean.</p>
      <p>"It's starting to become some remote kind of possibility. It's definitely not fixed yet but people are starting to talk about it."</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old last headlined the festival in 2004, when he performed a mammoth 33-song set including Wings material, a selection of The Beatles' most timeless releases and solo music.</p>

      <p>The Beatles recently re-entered the charts following a reissue of their classic album <i>Abbey Road</i>, and next year will mark five decades since their split, which prompted <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/paul-mccartney">McCartney</a>'s stellar solo career.</p>
      <p>Other major acts rumoured to headline the Pilton spectacular, which takes place between June 24 - June 28, include <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/glastonbury-2020-festival-rumours-lineup-3533665">Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift and Foals</a>.</p>
      <p>The first act to be confirmed was <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/glastonbury-2020-festival-diana-ross-3412277">Diana Ross</a>, who was announced for the Sunday afternoon legends slot back in October.</p>
