      <p>Former Cabinet Minister Jonathan Moyo has started opening up on his escape details together with fellow ex minister Savior Kasukuwere during the height of 2017 military coup which toppled the late former president Robert Mugabe.</p>
      <p>While it is no secret that the late former president Robert Mugabe assisted the duo’s escape to the neighboring Mozambique the finer details of their escape remain a mystery.</p>
      <p>Moyo has started releasing photos and footages of his grant escape with Kasukuwere together with a narration.</p>
      <p>He also claimed that the current Mozambican president Filipe Nyusi  also helped in facilitating his escape.</p>
      <p>Said Moyo</p>
      <aside>1,Sight after crossing Ruya River into Mozambique. At this time #TrevorNcube was lying on @Twitter &amp; to readers of his newspapers that we were under arrest at KGVI barracks. The other gentleman is a Mozambican. Details are in a coup story, yet to be told!<br/>2,Ruya River was drought-dry in Nov 2017, with no crocodile; we crossed it into Mozambique by motorbike &amp; were received by Sekuru Dzenga of Dzenga Village at 4am. Rested for an hour; proceeded to Mazowe to catch a lift to Tete and flew to Maputo next day!<br/>3,And the last installment in this Coup Story is this souvenir I’m keeping to bequeath to my grandchildren. I used the cap from the day we started our 19-hour long coup-escape from Harare to Dzenga Village in Mozambique; until 15 November 2018. Take care!<br/>4,ADDENDUM: Cde @Hon_Kasukuwere filmed the video on his fone. From Dzenga Village we went to Mazowe &amp; then Tete for the night. Flew to Maputo 21/11/17. From airport we went straight to President Nyusi’s office. He was waiting for us. The rest is history!</aside>
