      <h1>Euro 2020 tickets: How to get tickets for the Republic of Ireland's matches if they qualify</h1>
      <h2>A win over Denmark will see Ireland qualify for the finals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:27:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/eamon-doggett/" target="_blank">Eamon Doggett</a></address>
      <p>Ireland are just one win away from qualifying for Euro 2020 and the prospect of playing at least two group matches at home.</p>
      <p>In their way are old foes Denmark who need only a single point point from the crucial qualifier at the Aviva.</p>
      <p>Victory for Mick McCarthy's side though and we can look forward to the Euros rolling into Dublin.</p>
      <p>Here is all you need to know about getting tickets:</p>
      <h3>How can I get tickets for the Ireland matches?</h3>

      <p>The first phase of the general sale closed in July on this year but there will be a second phase of sales where one million tickets will be available to fans of the participating teams.</p>
      <p>You will be available to get tickets here on <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/ticketing/">UEFA's official website.</a></p>
      <h3>When will tickets go on sale?</h3>
      <p>The second phase of tickets sales will start after the final tournament draw, which takes place on 30 November 2019.</p>
      <p>Supporters must meet the criteria set out by the respective National Association in order to be allocated tickets at this stage. More information is set to be released on this should Ireland qualify for the finals.</p>
      <p>For all matches and categories where demand exceeds supply, tickets will be allocated by a lottery.</p>
      <h3>How much will tickets be?</h3>
      <p>Tickets in Dublin will be priced at €50, €125 and €185 across three categories.</p>
      <h3>Where will Ireland be playing?</h3>

      <p>If Ireland qualify for Euro 2020 directly i.e. by beating Denmark at the Aviva, a draw will be made to decide if they or Spain play all three of their group matches at home.</p>
      <p>If Ireland qualify for Euro 2020 via the playoffs, they will play two group matches at the Aviva in Dublin and will take on Spain in Bilbao.</p>
      <p>Then we can start dreaming...</p>
      <p>
        <b>If Ireland win Group E they will play...</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Last 16: Glasgow</li>
        <li>QF: Rome</li>
        <li>SF: Wembley</li>
        <li>Final: Wembley</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>If Ireland come second in Group E they will play...</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Last 16: Copenhagen</li>
        <li>QF: St Petersburg</li>
        <li>SF: Wembley</li>
        <li>Final: Wembley</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>When will the group stage take place?</h3>
      <p>The group stage matches will take place between 12-24 June.</p>
      <h3>When is the Euro 2020 draw?</h3>
      <p>The draw will take place on Saturday 30 November.</p>
      <p>It is set to start in Bucharest at 5pm (Irish time).</p>
      <h3>Which teams are involved?</h3>
      <p>The draw includes the teams that finished in the top two places from the ten qualifying groups plus the eventual four play-off winners.</p>

      <h3>How does the draw work?</h3>
      <p>Each team will be put into a designed pot. There are four pots altogether with six teams in each pot. The pots are ranked 1-4 with the highest seeded teams in pot 1, the next highest in pot 2 and so on...</p>
      <p>However, as there are 12 host nations, each nation that qualifies (or could qualify via the play-offs) is placed in one of the following groups so that they are guaranteed to be at home in at least two group games:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Group A: Italy, Azerbaijan</li>
        <li>Group B: Russia, Denmark</li>
        <li>Group C: Netherlands, Romania</li>
        <li>Group D: England, Scotland</li>
        <li>Group E: Spain, Republic of Ireland</li>
        <li>Group F: Germany, Hungary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If both teams from each of these groups qualify, another draw will be held to determine which team plays at home.</p>
      <p>In short, if Ireland qualify for Euro 2020, we know already that we will be guaranteed to be in Group E with Spain.</p>
