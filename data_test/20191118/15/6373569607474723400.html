      <h1>'Ridiculous' traffic island now also has cones around it</h1>
      <h2>The cones are expected to be there all week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:50:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Dowrick</a></address>
      <p>The new traffic island in Saltash - which locals have labelled 'ridiculous' - is now surrounded by cones.</p>
      <p>Several traffic cones have been spotted around the island, which appears to create two lanes - with the reason for it being installed revealed today.</p>
      <p>Cornwall Council has now explained that the island has been put up ahead of constructing a new cycle lane and expects the cones to surround the island for the rest of the week.</p>
      <p>The explanation comes after hundreds of baffled residents shared their <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/local-news/locals-confused-ridiculous-traffic-island-3544029">confusion over the 'ridiculous' traffic island</a> on social media, and many told Plymouth Live that they just couldn't understand why the 'strange' island had been put up.</p>
      <p>Before the cones were placed around the island, Saltash residents said they were baffled at the 'ridiculous' new traffic island that appeared to be dividing the road into two parts, leaving it too small for cars to get through on one side.</p>
      <p>The erection of the traffic island near the Brunel Pub car park, at the junction of Culver Road and Victoria Road, led to dozens of comments on social media from bemused and confused local residents trying to make sense of why it was there.</p>
      <p>Local resident Lisa-Marie Arnold said the island was 'hideous' and was confusing drivers as it's 'not clear'Â  whether drivers were no longer permitted to turn right.</p>
      <p>Lisa-Marie told Plymouth Live: "It looks like the people that have done the work and placement have no clue.</p>
      <p>"If it's been put there to stop the right-turn fair enough, but there's better ways if that's the case."</p>
      <p>"This island just looks like its been chucked there and that's it." she added.</p>
      <p>Now, Cornwall Council has put cones around the island and told Plymouth Live that the island has been erected in preparation of a new cycle lane.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the council said: "The road traffic island in Saltash is in preparation for a new cycle lane to be added.</p>
      <p>"Until the road markings have been updated, due over the next week, our team has put cones around the island to safely direct traffic down the road."</p>
