      <p>The outcome of the investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against a former teacher of Bishops Diocesan College in Cape Town will only be made known at the end of the school term, the school said on Monday.</p>
      <p>A short statement, after a request for an update on the probe, said the school did not want any distractions for the pupils during year-end exams.</p>
      <p>The SA Council of Educators last week said it too would hold off on its investigation until exams were over.</p>
      <p>The investigation followed allegations that former teacher Fiona Viotti engaged in sexual misconduct, initially with an 18-year-old matric pupil. The school later confirmed that several boys had been <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/bishops-teacher-several-boys-have-been-affected-over-a-number-of-years-says-school-20191015">affected over a number of years</a>, according to a preliminary report.</p>

      <p>The school's principal Guy Pearson asked anybody else who may have been affected to report this so their claims could also be investigated.Â </p>
      <p>The teacher resigned from the private school shortly before the allegations hit the news and, due to stress, was placed under medical care.</p>
      <p>Videos purporting to be of her were posted on a well-known porn website, but was then taken down.</p>
      <p>Her lawyer William Booth warned that it is a criminal offence to post such videos without the consent of the person in the images. His team were investigating who had posted the material.</p>
