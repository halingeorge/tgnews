      <h2>Ready for launch.</h2>

      <p>After launching on PC earlier this year, Kerbal Space Program: Breaking Ground is finally coming to PS4 and Xbox One on 5th December.</p>
      <p>The expansion boasts three new major elements for the Kerbonauts: "exploration, experimentation, and building new technology". Celestial bodies have been updated with new landscapes, and redesigned surface features which players can study to earn "insightful scientific data" to help on their journey through the solar system.</p>
      <p>There's a host of new scientific tools to help the Kerbals collect minerals, study geological shifts and even measure atmospheric changes. Players will even have access to brand new robotic parts to make more complex machinery to help them on their travels - or hinder them on their travels, as <a href="https://www.privatedivision.com/2019/11/18/kerbal-space-program-breaking-ground-expansion-comes-to-console-on-december-5th/">Private Division's post</a> definitely mentions something about "explosive failures".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-19-kerbal-space-program-2-in-development">Kerbal Space Program 2 was announced at this year's Gamescom</a> - we don't have a release date for it yet, but while we're waiting to hear more the Breaking Ground expansion should keep fans plenty busy.</p>
