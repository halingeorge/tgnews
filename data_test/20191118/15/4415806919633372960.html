      <h1>Ferrari to decide whether to stop Vettel and Leclerc racing each other</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:41:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Ferrari bosses will this week decide whether to stop Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc from racing each other after they crashed out of the Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>Vettel and Leclerc are due to arrive at Ferrari’s Maranello headquarters to explain how they came to collide on lap 66 of Sunday’s chaotic race.</p>
      <p>Mercedes were forced to revise their rules of engagement after Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed for a third time in the final year of their fractious relationship as team-mates.</p>

      <p>And Ferrari will consider reining in their drivers to avoid a repeat of Sunday’s embarrassing accident.</p>
      <p>“We need to sit down and decide where the limits are to make sure these things don’t happen anymore,” said Mattia Binotto, the Ferrari team principal.</p>
      <p>“When we have tried to manage the drivers before we have been criticised. When they are free to fight we have been criticised, too.</p>
      <p>“But we need to clarify what is silly, what is not, and what is the limit. When you have a crash there is no doubt that something has gone wrong.”</p>
      <p>Vettel’s partnership with Leclerc has proved troubling for Ferrari with both drivers vying for top spot in the team.</p>

      <p>Vettel was signed by Ferrari to end a drivers’ title drought which extends back to 2007, but Leclerc, a decade younger than the four-time world champion, has emerged as the team’s star for the future.</p>
      <p>Vettel’s £36million-a-season deal with Ferrari expires at the end of next year.</p>
      <p>“I am still convinced it is a luxury to have them in the same team because they are both very good drivers and a benchmark for each other,” added Binotto.</p>
      <p>“What I read or hear, is different to what I see internally with them. They have a good relationship, but certainly what happened on Sunday may not help that.”</p>

      <p>Hamilton, who was demoted to seventh following his late collision with Red Bull’s Alex Albon, said both Vettel and Leclerc will have been wounded by the events at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>Hamilton collided with former Mercedes team-mate Rosberg at the 2014 Belgian Grand Prix, and then in Spain and Austria two years later as they fought for the championship.</p>
      <p>“I have experienced it first hand,” said the six-time world champion. “The burden is that there are so many people involved with the team that it is not just about you.</p>
      <p>“And when all those people are relying on you to do your job and something like that happens, it is not a great feeling.”</p>
