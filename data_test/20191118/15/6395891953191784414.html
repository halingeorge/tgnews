      <p><b>WAVERLY, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A judge has delayed what was supposed to be the first trial connected to the investigation into the 2016 slayings of eight family members in Ohio.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Monday that both sides agreed to postpone the trial for Rita Newcomb just as jury selection was to begin. Officials didn't give a reason for the delay.</p>
      <p>Newcomb isn't charged with any of the Rhoden family killings. She is accused of forgery, obstructing justice and perjury charges related to the case.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old is the mother of one of the four suspects in the killings. Newcomb along with those charged in the killings has pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said after the arrests were announced a year ago that a custody dispute between two families may have been the motive.</p>
