      <p>A young Port Elizabeth man is one of two people who were reported missing in the ocean at Strandfontein in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>NSRI spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, said their Strandfontein duty crew was activated on Monday morning following reports of two people in difficulty in the water at a place known as 'Garbage Beach'.</p>
      <p>He said various other role-players also responded to the scene, including the Skymed helicopter, to search for two males, "a 17-year-old male from Delft in Cape Town and a 22-year-old male believed to be from Port Elizabeth and visiting friends in Delft".</p>
      <p>"They had been reported to have been swept into the water by rip-currents and were no longer visible in the water. Â Despite an extensive sea and shoreline search no sign of the two have been found," Lambinon said.</p>
      <p>"A police dive unit has been activated to continue in an ongoing search operation," he said.</p>
