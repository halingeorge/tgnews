      <h1>Long-awaited restoration work begins at Grade II listed rectory in Clifton Village</h1>
      <h2>It was sold at auction back in 2004</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:50:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>Work to restore a historic rectory in Nottinghamshire has finally got the go-ahead after a 15-year wait.</p>
      <p>The Old Rectory in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-abut/clifton">Clifton</a> Village is a Grade II listed building and former care home. The building fell into disrepair after it sold at auction in 2004.</p>
      <p>Despite some works, the site had been targeted by vandals and as time went on residents were concerned restoration would never get started.</p>
      <p>But as of Monday, November 18, work has begun to transform the rectory into four separate homes called The Gatehouse, The Lodge, The Cottage and The Rectory, each with their own entrance and garden.</p>
      <p>Three new luxury homes will also be built within the grounds, called Beech House, Cedar House and Oak House, which will be accessed by a gated private drive.</p>

      <p>Once the home to the Rector of Clifton, the property dates back to the mid-1700s and is a typical Georgian-style building with south facing garden elevations.</p>
      <p>The property has the original square stairwell with wooden cantilever stairs and large purpose-built rooms. It has a prominent position in Clifton Village.</p>
      <p>Midlands contractor G F Tomlinson has taken on the construction of the scheme, with works due to complete in autumn 2020, alongside CBP Architects and Haart Estate Agents.</p>

      <p>Speaking after the launch event, Pat Rice, chairwoman of the Clifton Village Residents' Association said: "Progress has been delayed after experts needed to assess the building for bats. But permission was granted last month and residents are so relieved.</p>
      <p>"We've been watching it sitting there for years as it deteriorated through vandalism.</p>
      <p>"To see it be neglected all these years was truly heart-rending as Georgian designs are typically attractive.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be a fantastic transformation and the contractors have said they are prepared to engage with the village to keep us updated.</p>
      <p>"It's been good for us to meet with councillors, our local MP, the architects, contractors and marketing teams so we can see the plans.</p>
      <p>"We're all very impressed and it should be finished to a high standard by this time next year."</p>
