      <h4>Tequila shots, board games, bubble baths — Emma White’s new music video for ‘If You’re In It’ has us all craving a nice hotel stay &amp; a super hot boyfriend!</h4>
      <p>Fresh off the success of her viral hit <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/06/07/women-country-music-cmt-awards-2019-interviews/">“Ten Year Town,”</a><b> Emma White</b> is back with a sultry music video to go along with her jam “If You’re In It,” and <b>HollywoodLife.com</b> has the EXCLUSIVE first look! In the vid for the upbeat song, Emma is joined by a super cute man at Nashville’s <b>The Fairlane Hotel</b> for a little staycation action! The pair enjoy the incredible room that includes a stone fireplace and amazing bath tub (we’ll get to that later!) Emma puts dating apps on blast (same, girl), as she rolls in the bright white sheets singing, “<i>Don’t wanna, swipe right ’til I get a match wanna be totally in it with you / Don’t wanna, guess game not knowing when it could be exclusively me plus you / If you’re in it I’m in it, down to forget about anyone else but you / If you feel what I’m feeling, if not I’ll forget it tell me what you wanna do.</i>” Now that’s something we can relate to!</p>
      <p>“It’s about someone I met on a dating app. I wrote it last summer and actually sent it to him, and then that relationship ended,” Emma revealed in an <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/09/20/ryan-hurd-platonic-ep-interview/">EXCLUSIVE interview</a> with <b>HollywoodLife.com</b>. “It’s a fun song, it’s basically like, I really like you, do you like me?!” In the video, there seems to be no question whether the man is into Emma, though! At one point, the two sneak into a private party in the Fairlane Hotel lobby, where the guy takes the mic to profess his admiration of Emma! Then, the chef cooks the couple up a special meal that they share before taking things up to their room. Steamy! At another point, he brings Emma takeout while she’s sitting in a bubble bath — and then he joins her, fully clothed!</p>
      <p>While she calls “If You’re In It” more of a pop-leaning number, Emma added that her future releases will be a mix of <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/04/11/mitchell-tenpenny-interview-women-country-music-girlfriend/">her country roots,</a> as well as her inspirations, like <b>Ed Sheeran</b>. “I released an EP that was more of a songwriters set of songs I felt like showcased me, bare bones being really honest with people, setting the stage of what it to come,” she explained. “It was like, this is who I am and I wanted to make a statement about what I really care about and think about, but then to come is more production and entertainment. I want to do something that’s chameleon-esque, with production value.”</p>
