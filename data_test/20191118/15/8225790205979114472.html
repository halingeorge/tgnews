      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - Hawaii education officials say public school students who study and master English as a second language before high school were more likely to graduate on time than native speakers.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/">The Honolulu Star-Advertiser</a> reported Sunday that 90% of students who completed the stateâ€™s English Learner program before entering high school graduated on time.</p>
      <p>Data presented to the state Board of Education Nov. 7 shows students who did not require English-language support had an on-time graduation rate of 83%.</p>
      <p>Officials report a 69% on-time graduation rate for students enrolled in the English Learner program during high school.</p>
      <p>Officials say the lag is expected since those students have not yet mastered the school language of instruction.</p>
      <p>The information on English learners was prepared by the Hawaii P-20 Partnerships for Education.</p>
