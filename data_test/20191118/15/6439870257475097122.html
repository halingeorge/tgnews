      <p>GREENVILLE, S.C. (WCSC/WYFF) - Recent attacks on horses in the Upstate now have the attention of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division.</p>

      <p>Greenville County Sheriff’s Office deputies are currently looking into two incidents involving horses.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 31, a horse was found standing on Fews Bridge Road bleeding heavily with multiple cuts. The second happened between Nov. 14 and Nov. 16 when owners found one of their horses shot dead.</p>
