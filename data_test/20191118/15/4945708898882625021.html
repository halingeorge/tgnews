      <p>Yandex, the internet giant said to be Russia's answer to Google, unveiled planned governance changes Monday as authorities seek to tighten control over the internet.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/company/">company</a> that operates Russia's largest search engine and news aggregator said it would create a Public Interest Foundation able to block any single entity from accumulating 10 percent or more of its economic or voting interests.</p>
      <p>The foundation's board is to consist of just three members of Yandex's <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/management+team/">management team</a>, including company founder and chief executive Arkady Volozh, as well as representatives of top universities and non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p>Yandex's announcement came after a Russian lawmaker proposed limits on foreign ownership of top internet companies to tighten online control.</p>
      <p>Yandex N.V., the parent company of Yandex Group, is registered in the Netherlands, and about 85 percent of its shares trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York.</p>
      <p>At present, Russian state lender Sberbank holds a "golden share" in Yandex that allows it to veto consolidation of 25 percent or more of the company's shares.</p>
      <p>The Financial Times reported that Yandex had agreed its new structure with the Kremlin, but President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any talks with the company.</p>
      <p>Peskov nonetheless told reporters that the Kremlin was looking at the restructuring plan "with great interest."</p>
      <p>He praised Yandex's management for understanding that the state would give "special attention" to the company because of its size and significance.</p>
      <p>All the proposed changes are subject to shareholder approval at a meeting on December 20.</p>
      <p>"With this behind us, we can get back to doing what we do best: innovating, providing world-class products and services to our users, and delivering superior returns to our investors," Volozh was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
      <p>Ruling United Russia party MP Anton Gorelkin has proposed a bill that would prevent foreigners from owning more than 20 percent of Russia's top online companies.</p>
      <p>He said Monday that he has withdrawn the bill to rework it.</p>
      <p>Russian law already limits foreign ownership of media companies to 20 percent.</p>
