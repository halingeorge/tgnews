      <p>Google has detailed a few of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> deals, which start on November 24th, just a few days before Black Friday. Deals on Google products will be happening all over the web, including at Google’s online storefront. Regardless of where you shop, the discounts cover almost its entire range of products, including the Pixel 4, Stadia, Nest Wifi, Nest Mini, other Nest products, and more.</p>
      <p>While the start and end dates for most of these sales haven’t been shared, we’ll be keeping this post updated with the latest info.</p>
      <h3>Pixel 4</h3>
      <p>Starting on November 24th, Google’s Pixel 4 will be $200 off, priced at $599 for the 64GB version and $699 for the 128GB version. Applying this discount to the Pixel 4 XL makes it $699 for the base 64GB version and $799 for the model with 128GB of storage. This deal concludes at the end of Cyber Monday, which takes place on December 2nd.</p>

      <h3>Pixel 3A</h3>
      <p>Starting on Thanksgiving Day, November 28th (and ending as Cyber Monday concludes on Monday, December 2nd), Google’s Pixel 3A and 3A XL will each be $100 off their usual prices at Best Buy, Amazon, and B&amp;H Photo, with more to be confirmed as we get closer to Black Friday. The start and end times for this sale are more staggered than the Pixel 4.</p>
      <p>This sale brings the starting price of the Pixel 3A down to $299.9. For the Pixel 3A XL, with its bigger screen and battery, you’re looking at a starting price of $379. These phones are commonly $50 off their retail prices, and the best deal before this was when they launched in May; several retailers included $100 gift cards with purchase, but the actual price of the phones didn’t change.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pixel 3A will be $299.99 at <a href="https://amzn.to/34JB8lT">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-3%2Fgoogle-pixel-3a-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1556124332800.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1556124332800">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://fave.co/33w8Aw7">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>
        <li>Pixel 3A XL will be $379 at <a href="https://amzn.to/2qFmmh9">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-3%2Fgoogle-pixel-3a-xl-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1556124838576.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1556124838576">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://fave.co/32sUH0q">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>

      <h3>Nest products</h3>
      <p>Google hasn’t yet shared start dates for the below deals, but here’s a sneak peek at what’s to come later in the month from the <a href="https://store.google.com/us/">Google Store</a> and possibly other retailers.</p>
      <p>At the Google Store, the new Stadia Premiere Edition comes bundled with Nest Wifi (three-pack; one router, two points) for $398. Normally, the Nest Wifi three-pack costs $349, so adding on this Stadia package that includes a controller and a Chromecast Ultra is a good deal if you’re in for the investment.</p>
      <p>Another Nest Wifi deal is a $40 discount on the Nest Wifi router and point bundle. It usually costs $269, but you’ll be able to pick it up for $229.</p>
      <p>The Nest Hub smart display will be $79, which is a $50 discount off of its retail price. Granted, it doesn’t usually cost that much; $99 is a normal price to pay for this product. If you’re looking for the bigger Nest Hub Max that has a camera, Google is knocking $30 off of that, bringing it down to $199. This is the first official price cut we’ve seen for the Nest Hub Max.</p>
      <p>The new Google Nest Mini smart speaker will be almost half-off of its usual $49 price. That makes it $29, which is a nice price for this wall-mountable speaker.</p>
