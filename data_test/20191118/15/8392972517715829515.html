      <h1>I'm A Celebrity viewers in hysterics at Ant and Dec gags about Prince Andrew's 'sweating'</h1>
      <h2>They notched up a dig against royal within minutes</h2>

      <p>Cheeky hosts Ant and Dec delighted viewers by wasting no time and getting stuck into <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/piers-morgan-rips-into-prince-andrew-for-desperate-toe-curling-interview-about-friendship-with-paedophile/">Prince Andrew</a> as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">Iâ€™m A Celebrity</a> returned to TV screens last night.</p>
      <p>Within minutes of Sunday nightâ€™s programme beginning, the presenting pair had already notched up one dig against the beleaguered royal - and shortly followed it up with another swipe just ten minutes later.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> cracked the first gag after <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> had set him up by mentioning how the Iâ€™m A Celebrity celebrity campmates were sweating with nerves over heading into the jungle.</p>
      <p>The Geordie star began: "And what a line up we've got in store for you this year.</p>

      <p>"Ten celebrities all of them very nervous, all of them sweating."</p>
      <p>"Presuming they can sweat. Not everyone can sweat, apparently," Dec noted in a mock sage manner, referring to how Prince Andrew claimed he once suffered from a medical condition that prevented him from perspiring.</p>
      <aside>Not everyone can sweat, apparently.</aside>
      <p>The bizarre claim - <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-let-side-down-over-friendship-with-paedophile/">made during Prince Andrew's disastrous Newsnight grilling over the weekend</a> - was mentioned in response to Virginia Giuffre's previous claim he sweated "profusely" when dancing with her in a nightclub in 2001 when she was 17.</p>
      <p>And it wasnâ€™t too much longer into the first episode of the new series of the ITV reality show before Ant and Dec took another swipe at Prince Andrew.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Echoing their earlier words, the production crew tittered as the presenters delivered a similar line about â€˜not everybody being able to sweatâ€™.</p>
      <p>"I love that shade from Ant &amp; Dec on Prince Andrew ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£," chuckled one viewer on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Another said: "Ant &amp; Dec making sly jokes at Prince Andrew's expense made my night ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>A third wrote: "Cool Prince Andrew dig by ant &amp; dec."</p>

      <p>And a fourth person tweeted: "Straight in with a Prince Andrew joke ðŸ˜‚ ...god Iâ€™ve missed Ant &amp; Dec! #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>But not everybody was amused. One person complained: "For Ant/Dec 2 make crass gags about sweating related to a royal who befriended a convicted paedophile is total hypocrisy."</p>
      <p>On Saturday night, BBC2 viewers watched the eighth in line to the throne <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-let-side-down-over-friendship-with-paedophile/">admit he let the royal family down</a> by remaining friends with late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction.</p>

      <p>The 59-year-old <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/the-queens-favourite-son-revealed-and-its-not-who-you-think/">'favourite son' of the Queen</a> said he 'kicks himself' every day for the decision - but denied ever meeting Virginia Giuffre - who claims the royal had sex with her when she was a teen.</p>
      <p>Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan declared the conversation between the Duke of York and journalist Emily Maitlis as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/piers-morgan-rips-into-prince-andrew-for-desperate-toe-curling-interview-about-friendship-with-paedophile/">"desperate" and "toe-curling"</a>.</p>
