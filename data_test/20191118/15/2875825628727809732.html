      <p>Prosecutors in Holland have opened an investigation after a second tier match was suspended for racist abuse.</p>
      <p>Sunday's fixture between FC Den Bosch and Excelsior Rotterdam has held up for half an hour after the away side's striker Ahmad Mendes Moreira was abused.</p>
      <p>Moreira, whose parents hail from the West African nations of Bissau-Guinea and Guinea, said he was called a "negro and cotton-picker" by fans from the beginning of the game.</p>
      <p>With the scores at 1-1 earlier in the match, Moreira gave away a foul over by the touchline, before he was shouted at by Den Bosch supporters sitting nearby - which forced an angry reaction from the player.</p>

      <p>He was escorted off the pitch by sympathetic teammates before a lengthy break, during which the match looked as though it could be abandoned.</p>
      <p>However the game soon resumed and Moreira quickly provided the best response, scoring and cupping his ears in celebration.</p>
      <p>Objects were hurled at the 24-year-old and his teammates as they celebrated.</p>
      <p>Dutch football association KNVB said it would investigate the incident and look into possible sanctions against Den Bosch and its supporters.</p>

      <p>"Together with the club, we will do everything to track down who did this", the KNVB's league director Jan Bluyssen said.</p>
      <p>Den Bosch coach Erik van der Ven blasted Moreira as a "pathetic little man" for his actions during the match.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a post match press conference, Moreira said: "That just hurts me a lot."</p>
      <p>"I'm just very angry and very sad that these things still happen."</p>
      <p>Former Man Utd star Memphis Depay reacted to the incident on social media, tweeting: "I'm sick and tired to see these images over and over! When is it going to stop!!? #SayNoToRacism."</p>
      <p>He then tweeted the Dutch FA, saying: "What we going to do? Specially with the upcoming Euro 2020?"</p>
      <p>Den Bosch released a statement after the fixture condemning the behaviour of their fans.</p>
      <p>It read: "Let one thing be clear; FC Den Bosch distances itself from everything that has to do with this and acts strongly against stadium visitors who are guilty of this."</p>
      <p>The match eventually ended in a 3-3 draw, after Excelsior fought back from 2-1 down following Moreira's goal, and then levelling late on through Ruben Rodrigues.</p>
