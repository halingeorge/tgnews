      <h1>Trump says he’ll ‘strongly consider’ testifying in impeachment hearings</h1>
      <h2>U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly invited the president on Sunday to testify in front of investigators.</h2>

      <p>Donald Trump said he would “strongly consider” testifying to the House in the impeachment hearings after Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited him to participate in the proceedings determining the fate of his presidency, though added in the same tweet that "she also said I could do it in writing."</p>
      <p>“Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” the president tweeted Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Trump lashed out at Pelosi on Twitter Monday, yet again railing against the ongoing impeachment inquiry and lobbing familiar attacks at the speaker of the House in a two-part tweet.</p>
      <p>“Our Crazy, Do Nothing (where’s USMCA, infrastructure, lower drug pricing &amp; much more?) Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they &amp; Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sunday’s DEFACE THE NATION that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>If Trump were to submit a written statement rather than appearing in person, he would avoid live questioning that could put him in danger of accidentally perjuring himself, but his answers would still be considered under oath.</p>
      <aside>“Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” — <i>Donald Trump via tweet</i></aside>
      <p>Trump previously submitted written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller as part of the Russia investigation. In his report, Mueller said Trump's answers were "inadequate" and "incomplete or imprecise."</p>
      <p>Trump's tweets Monday came after Pelosi publicly invited the president on Sunday to testify in front of investigators ahead of the second week of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“If he has information that is exculpatory, that means 'ex' — taking away — 'culpable' — blame — then we look forward to seeing it,” she said in an interview that aired on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “He could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants.”</p>
      <p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed Pelosi’s invitation.</p>
      <p>“If Donald Trump doesn’t agree with what he’s hearing, doesn’t like what he’s hearing, he shouldn’t tweet. He should come to the committee and testify under oath. And he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath,” Schumer told reporters on Sunday. “What is he hiding?”</p>
