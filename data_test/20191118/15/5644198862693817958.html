      <p>ROME: ArcelorMittal is drafting a plan to re-commit to the 2018 deal, under which it bought the troubled Ilva steel plant in southern Italy, on three conditions, Il Messaggero daily reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>After withdrawing from the contract, the world's biggest steel maker is drafting a proposal for Italy's government in which it will demand the reintroduction of legal immunity, the possibility to revise its industrial plan and the layoff of 5,000 workers.</p>

      <p>Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has postponed a meeting with ArcelorMittal's Lakshmi Mittal, due this week, hoping that a Milan court will already decide on an appeal filed by Rome last Friday, Il Messaggero said.</p>
      <p>The report added that economy minister Roberto Gualtieri is examining the potential entrance of state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti in the shareholding of the Franco-Indian company that manages Ilva.</p>
