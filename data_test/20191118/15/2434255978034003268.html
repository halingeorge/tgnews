      <p>Budget supermarket Aldi has confirmed its Kevin the Carrot and friends toys will be back in stores next week.</p>
      <p>Aldi's 2019 Christmas advert featuring the beloved vegetable was a huge hit and now we know when the much-anticipated range will be available to buy in store.</p>
      <p>Whoever thought that a soft toy posing as one of our five a day would be such a runaway success?</p>
      <p>So much so, folks queued in the freezing cold last year to buy cute little toy.</p>

      <p>For those who wish to go above and beyond, there's also the option to buy a one metre tall Kevin toy, as well as a Giant Katie.</p>
      <p>A few of the famous carrots friends are tagging a long with him as well.</p>
      <p>The supermarket giant has introduced Tiny Tom and wait for it....Russell Sprout - you guessed it, a sprout! (We know - it's the best name yet, so good you may even eat your sprouts at your Christmas dinner)!</p>
      <p>This year, the range is bigger and better than ever, with 23 Kevin related products including Family Pyjamas, a Children’s Christmas Jumper and a range of stationery.</p>

      <p>You might remember that last year the demand for Kevin the Carrot toys was so intense that they completely sold out after just one day on the shelves - so make sure you don't miss out!</p>
      <p>As for the advert itself, we see that Kevin has managed to get himself into something of a pickle after tangling with Russell and his street gang, The Leafy Blinders.</p>
