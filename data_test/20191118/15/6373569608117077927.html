      <p>If you love both Christmas and fried chicken, then your prayers may have just been answered.</p>
      <p>KFC's Christmas menu has just launched in restaurants today, and contains three new seasonal items.</p>
      <p>The KFC Festive Burger, Festive Fries and a new Mint Choc Krushem Soft Serve combine the brand's love of Original Recipe fried chicken with traditional Christmas ingredients.</p>
      <p>The Festive Burger includes a classic Original Recipe fillet with a crispy hash brown, sage and onion stuffing mayo, tangy cranberry dressing and a layer of cheese.</p>

      <p>It costs £4.59 by itself or you can opt for a meal for £1 extra.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can also get a Festive Burger Box Meal for £6.89, which comes with a burger, drink, fries and some festive sides of beans and a chicken drumstick.</p>
      <p>There's also a new flavour of fries for the Christmas period. KFC's Festive Fries are sprinkled with a smoky seasoning of pepper, toasted onions and garlic and herbs.</p>

      <p>Jo Tivers, Top Festive Elf at KFC UK &amp; Ireland, commented on the new menu, saying: “A round of santa-plause for this epic festive feast please.</p>
      <p>"We'll let turkey have its moment on the 25th but until then, we’ve got your back.".</p>
