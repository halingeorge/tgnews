      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:28:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity's</a> Helen Flanagan has taken to Instagram to share with her fans what she thinks of the show seven years after she went Down Under.</p>
      <p>The former Corrie star filmed herself snuggled up in her pyjamas as she watched yesterday's series opener, and reflected on the ups and the downs.</p>
      <p>"Right so I'm just catching up now on I'm A Celebrity," the 29 year old said, "Just the thought of when Ant and Dec come on and say, 'For this challenge', it just gives me the fear.</p>
      <p>"I remember as well when they used to explain things to me about the trials, I'd panic because I'd be so scared like when they used to talk to me about things I wouldn't even process because I'd be so worked up.</p>
      <p>"I remember I did this trial, ugh, vile, I hate crocodiles, I had to go underneath the water and get these stars, but I forgot I had to get them with my mouth, but I was so worked up I just didn't think."</p>

      <p>The model also dished that she'd be letting her little girl Matilda, born in 2015, watch her in action in old clips of her BushTucker Trials.</p>
      <p>"I'm gonna let Matilda watch back some old clips, which she's gonna find hilarious," Helen laughed.</p>
      <p>Despite the public giving Helen a rough time but often voting for her to take on the trials, she does think on her time on the show with fondness.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm A Celebrity, even though I was beyond rubbish at the trials, it was an amazing experience when I look back on it."</p>

      <p>Helen was loving fellow soap star Jacqueline Jossa, who ended her run on EastEnders last year.</p>
      <p>"Jacqueline's coming across so nice already," Helen gushed, "She's just such a lovely girl, already killing it."</p>
      <p>"I really like Nadine," she added of the former Girls Aloud singer, "I couldn't jump out of that helicopter."</p>
      <p>Tonight's show will see Good Morning Britain's Kate Garraway and Olympian turned reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner take on 30,000 creepy crawlies as they battle for those all-important stars.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn impressed viewers last night with her steely determination and motivation during the challenges, while Rak-Su singer and former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> star Myles Stephenson became a fan favourite for his chilled out approach.</p>
