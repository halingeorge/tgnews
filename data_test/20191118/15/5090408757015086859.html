      <p>Dwayne Haskins made the best throw of his young career on Sunday, but it didn’t even count.</p>
      <p>In the second quarter, Haskins, making his second career start, got flushed from the pocket by the New York Jets. While on the run, Haskins tossed a floating, 67-yard bomb to rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who made the catch and took it an additional 15 yards or so.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the play got called back because of a holding penalty on the Washington Redskins.</p>
      <p>Washington ran three more plays, didn’t get a first down and punted.</p>
