      <p>Germany began their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign strongly and passed the single biggest test when they won 3-2 away to Holland in the opening game thanks to Nico Schulz’s last-minute goal. Further victories over Belarus and Estonia – the latter an 8-0 rout in Mainz – were made to look entirely routine. But they suffered a setback in September with a 4-2 home defeat to the Dutch, who scored all of their goals in the second half. However, that proved just a blip and they have won every qualifier since, booking their ticket to the finals with a 4-0 win over Belarus on Saturday.</p>
