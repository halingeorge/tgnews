      <p>Accra, Nov. 18, GNA - Mr. Kwadwo Baah Agyemang, former Member of Parliament (MP), for Asante Akyem North and Board Chairman for National Sports Authority (NSA), has described the just ended TeqballTournament as a success, saying the sport has come to stay.</p>
      <p>Mr. Baah Agyemang, who is the brain behind the tournament that took place in Agogo in the Asante Akyem Constituency, said though the sport was new to Ghana and the people of Asante Akyem, the euphoria that the tournament generated was overwhelming and it's was a clear indication of how well the sport had come to stay.</p>
      <p>"This was a way of getting the people together in a different way by introducing a different sport or game all together and it achieved that purpose.</p>
      <p>“The young and old came out in their numbers to partake in the sport, which needed all parts of the body to play aside the hands".</p>
      <p>According to him, it was always important in making sure that there was an avenue for him to interact with his constituents and how best he could help and sports was a great way of doing so.</p>
      <p>"I know there are so many issues confronting my Constituency and it is important I created the platform to meet them and interact in ways to help ourselves.</p>
      <p>"Sports present that big platform, because you have both the young and old turning up for it and we have that interaction after every sporting activity.</p>
      <p>"I have been organising the Asante Akyem Marathon for some time now, we have had soccer tournaments too and the Teqball Tournament has also happened and like you know, we mostly have weekend jogging and aerobics as well as, which is not going to end any time soon,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Teqball Tournament which brought together over five hundred participants including the young and old in both sexes is a game played as a single or double game.</p>
