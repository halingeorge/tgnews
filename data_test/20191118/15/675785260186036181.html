      <h2>EXCLUSIVE Public schoolboy Joshua Molnar stabbed 17-year-old Yousef Makki in Manchester and is serving a 16-month sentence for possessing a knife and perverting the course of justice</h2>

      <p>A teenager who killed Yousef Makki has submitted a bid to be released from jail 'to spend time with his family'.</p>
      <p>Joshua Molnar, now 18, killed the 17-year-old in an argument over drugs in Hale Barns, Cheshire, on March 2.</p>
      <p>Yousef, a scholarship pupil at Manchester Grammar School was knifed in the heart by pal Molnar.</p>
      <p>Molnar, formerly of prestigious £12,000-a-year Cheadle Hume School, was acquitted of the murder and manslaughter of the straight-A student in July, on the grounds of self-defence.</p>
      <p>He is currently serving a 16-month sentence and training order at a young offenders' institution after he admitted possessing the knife which inflicted the wound from which Yousef died.</p>
      <p>He also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by telling police someone else had caused the injury.</p>

      <p>Yousef's sister Jade Akoume, 28, told Mirror Online she was visited by a family liasion officer on Friday who told her that Molnar had applied for a day release to "spend time with him family" at the end of the month.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-three said: "We are appalled.</p>
      <p>"It appears the application has been made so he can spend the day with his family - but it's only months after he's been sentenced.</p>
      <p>"Yousef will never ever have the chance to spend time with his family again.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"It's another real kick in the teeth as we will never have the chance to have another day with Yousef and they are fully aware of that."</p>
      <p>Yousef's family had appealed against Molnar's sentence but a judge ruled it was not unduly lenient.</p>
      <p>The family were also left reeling after Monlar's wealthy parents Mark and Stephanie hired Manchester PR agency MC2 Communications to tell their story - a move Yousef's mum Debbie called "shameless".</p>
      <p>Stephanie, 51, is the co-founder of a chain of Cheshire nurseries, and 56-year-old Mark, is a company director and business consultant.</p>

      <p>Stephanie said her son fully accepts responsibility for Yousef's death.</p>
      <p>Jade said: "This feels like another opportunity for the family to show their lack of remorse.</p>
      <p>"Mum is not taking this news well at all, it's like every time we try to move on his name comes up again.</p>
      <p>"It feels like he is doing this to taunt us."</p>

      <p>If Molnar is granted the day release, which could take place by the end of the month, Jade said he is expected to be banned from entering Manchester.</p>
      <p>"We've been told he won't be allowed back in the area so at least we don't have to worry about bumping into him.</p>
      <p>"But the judge who sentenced him spoke out against his fascination with knives and knives being a cancer on society.</p>
      <p>"What kind of message does it send if he can be let out on day release so soon?"</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman from the Ministry of Justice said she was unable to comment as the application was being processed.</p>
