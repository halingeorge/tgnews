      <h1>Pitti Uomo 97 Will 'Show its Flags' at January 2020 Trade Show in Florence</h1>
      <h2>“A flag is never a silent fabric.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:44:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Iley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/pitti-uomo">Pitti Uomo</a>, the international trade show that sees fashion brands from around the world descend upon Florence, has unveiled its theme for January. Looking to the symbolism and power a flag can hold, such as identity, nationality, pride and celebration, this coming Pitti will explore the various meanings pieces of fabric possess in our culture.</p>

As always, January’s fair will see a special guest invited for a special unveiling. This season sees <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/stefano-pilati">Stefano Pilati</a>, the designer behind the independent label <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/random-identities">Random Identities</a>, hold the honor, and guests can look forward to an exclusive preview of his upcoming Fall/Winter 20/21 collection.</p>
