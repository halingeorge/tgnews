      <p>Fans of streaming TV and movies without paying for cable or satellite already know that one of the best ways to get content from streaming sources onto your big screen is the Amazon Fire TV Stick. Amazon has a smoking good deal going on right now for the Fire TV Stick 4K bundle with a third generation Echo Dot smart speaker.</p>
      <p>The bundle deal gets shoppers the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/fire-tv-stick-4k">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> and the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/echo-dot">Echo Dot</a> for $46.99. That is 53% off the normal $99.98 price the bundle goes for. The bundle is cheaper than the Fire TV Stick 4K alone, which typically sells for $49.99. Anyone wanting a Fire TV Stick 4K and the Fire TV Recast DVR with an HD antenna can get that bundle for $249.95, which is a discount of $50 off the regular $299.97 price.</p>
