      <h1>ASUS Gaming Marketing Chief Vivian Lien To Replace Frank Azor As VP Of Dell And Alienware Gaming</h1>

      <p>Earlier this year, we reported that Frank Azor -- who was one of the original co-founders of Alienware and served as VP and GM for Dell's XPS, G Series and Alienware gaming brands -- was <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/alienware-dell-frank-azor-leaving-for-amd-gaming">exiting the company to take position at AMD</a>. Today, we have received confirmation from multiple reliable sources that Azor's official replacement has been named, and she is none other than Vivian Lien of ASUS.</p>
      <p>For those that have been around the enthusiast computing and gaming community for a while, Vivian should be familiar to you. She most recently served as the Global Head of Marketing for <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/asus">ASUS</a> Gaming. Vivian has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivian-lien-kralevich-822b85/">been with ASUS since 2007</a>, where she has become a powerhouse presence in the marketing sphere for the enthusiast-centric company. So, it should come as no surprise that Dell would want to tap her expertise to head marketing efforts for Dell's gaming hardware and premium consumer laptop and desktop brands.</p>
      <p>At this point, we don't have any further details from our sources on when Vivian will start her new position at Dell (though we heard it was today actually). However, we'll be sure to update this post once official confirmation comes down from <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/dell">Dell</a> or ASUS.</p>
      <p>Vivian will be entering Dell at a time that sees the company loaded with fresh hardware, including the brand new <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/alienware-aurora-amd-ryzen-edition-review">Alienware Aurora AMD Ryzen Edition</a> that we reviewed last week. This futuristic-looking gaming rig is powered by AMD's brand-new flagship <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/ryzen-9-3950x">Ryzen 9 3950X</a> 16-core/32-thread processor, and is hooked up with 32GB of DDR4-2933 memory, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card, and a 1TB NVMe PCIe SSD.<br/><br/>More to come here as the announcement likely rolls out and we get further details. </p>
