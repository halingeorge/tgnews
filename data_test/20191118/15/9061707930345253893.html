      <p>Police are urging residents in Swadlincote to keep their homes secure after two properties were broken into on the same night.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 16, two houses in New Street, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/swadlincotes-historic-pottery-archive-building-3549875">Church Gresley</a>, were broken into between midnight and 5am on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>A burglar snuck into the first of the two houses, through an unlocked door, at some point between midnight and 5am and stole a PlayStation console and controllers.</p>
      <p>The second house was also entered via an unlocked door. It is not known what, if anything, was stolen, said a police spokesman.</p>
      <p>The two burglaries occurred after another break-in in Weston Street, Swadlincote on Friday, November 8.</p>
      <p>Police are now investigating the possibility that all three burglaries could be linked.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/white-van-stolen-busy-south-3549322">Derbyshire Police</a> said: "We are urging residents in Swadlincote and the surrounding villages to review their home security following several burglaries.</p>
      <p>"In each case, the homeowner was inside when the burglary took place but they did not see the thief.</p>
      <p>"We are asking residents to make sure they lock windows and doors before going to bed."</p>
      <p>Anyone who has information about the thefts is asked to contact PC Elliot Dicker, by calling 101, quoting reference number 19000613713.</p>
