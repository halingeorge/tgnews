      <p>Divers will be required to help with the recovery of a car that plunged into the Kettle River in Grand Forks over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Emergency crews were alerted to a motor vehicle accident at the corner of 12th Street and Kettle River Drive around 1:15 a.m. on Saturday, said Grand Forks acting fire chief George Seigler.</p>
      <p>“The female occupant was able to self rescue from the vehicle and out of the river as well,” he told Castanet.</p>
      <p>RCMP say the four-door-Oldsmobile is believed to have been travelling east along Kettle River Drive near the Black Train Bridge when it suddenly left the roadway and entered the river. </p>
      <p>The driver and sole occupant, a 24-year-old Grand Forks woman, sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital for a checkup.</p>
      <p>"Police are investigating reports that the driver performed an evasive manoeuver to avoid colliding with wildlife," said Cpl. Jesse O'Donaghey, of the RCMP Southeast District. "Although speed has not been ruled out, investigators do believe that alcohol was a factor in this early morning crash."</p>
      <p>Witnesses are asked to come forward to police.</p>
      <p>The car remains on the bottom of the Kettle River. Seigler says a towing company has been tasked with removing the wreck, but divers will be needed for the recovery. </p>
