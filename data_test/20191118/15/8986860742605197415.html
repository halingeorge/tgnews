      <p>Gari soakings aka Agyenkwa is one food that comes in handy when most people are broke especially in the boarding houses and students in the hostel.</p>
      <p>Even though it’s easy to be made, the way you enjoy eating your gari is up to you.</p>
      <p>While some prefer to add milk to the ingredients others, on the other hand, like to change the taste by adding yogurt and biscuit.</p>
      <p>Well, a young man has taken gari a notch higher by adding tomatoes.</p>
      <p>On social media, the twitter user with the handle @lemerstachu shared a photo of a gari soaking he is about to take which has gotten people talking.</p>
      <p>See the photo below:</p>
