      <h1>Mass Effect 5 is in very early development</h1>

      <p>It looks like Bioware is working on another <i>Mass Effect</i> under Michael Gamble, who is a project director at Bioware. The game is in very early development, as Bioware is already working on the <i>Dragon Age 4</i> and the recently announced overhauled <i>Anthem</i>.</p>
      <p>Bioware went through a rough patch these last few years and unfortunately no patch was able to fix it. Nonetheless, even if their latest game is a complete disaster, they seem to be pushing forward.</p>
      <p>Personally, I have very little faith in Bioware and EA in general. I think it might prove difficult for them to get back on their feet after <i>Anthem</i>. Maybe if <i>Dragon Age 4</i> is actually great, because itâ€™s been a while since we had an awesome epic RPG experience.</p>

      <p>There is no information on the release date, since Bioware have not officially confirmed anything at this point.</p>
