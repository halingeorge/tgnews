      <p>SoftBank mobile payment JV PayPay hit 20 million users in Japan, with plans in place to continue its frequent promotional campaigns to drive further growth in users and cashless transactions.</p>
      <p>The service, which is a joint venture between SoftBank and Yahoo Japan, launched in October 2018 and reached 15 million users <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/money/news-money/softbank-mobile-payments-jv-reaches-15m-users/">within the first 12 months of operation</a>.</p>
      <p>Its latest 5 million users were added in 47 days, during which it undertook a thanksgiving campaign and offer related to its reward points scheme. The activity, PayPay noted, contributed to the increase of users on the system.</p>
      <p>PayPay will launch a number of promotional schemes over the next month including a reward boost, cashback initiative and lottery for users.</p>
      <p><b>Cash heavy<br/></b>Japan had been viewed as a tough market for mobile payment companies. On announcing the launch of PayPay, SoftBank estimated 80 per cent of transactions in the country were made using physical cash.</p>
      <p>However, authorities are keen to drastically decrease the use of physical currency and <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/softbank-sets-lofty-targets-for-japan-payments-play/">have set lofty national targets</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to activities by brands including PayPay, several of the countryâ€™s providers banded together to <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/money/news-money/ntt-docomo-backs-japan-payment-project/">form the Mobile Payment Alliance</a> to promote the use of the technology.</p>
