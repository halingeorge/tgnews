      <h1>Watch LeBron James high five himself after he's left hanging</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:28:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/andy-moser/" target="_blank">Andy Moser</a></address>
      <p>LeBron James, NBA superstar and GOAT contender, was left hanging on the bench Sunday night when the Lakers faced off against the Atlanta Hawks. </p>
      <p>James didn't seem bothered, but there's surprisingly a lot happening in this little three-second clip.</p>

      <p>First, the obvious: LeBron reaches out to teammate Dwight Howard for a standard high five. Howard, who is 6'10" and quite used to blocking shots, rejects LeBron in an entirely different way, not even acknowledging the attempt. Howard then slaps hands with a man in a navy blue suit instead. </p>
      <p>Once LeBron notices what just happened, he high fives himself. Because why not? But then, the man in the dark grey suit behind LeBron decides he wants to be a hero. Having witnessed the stone-cold rejection in front of his face, he ponders for a brief moment and then boldly reaches his hand out to LeBron as a consolation. That man is then, left hanging. Oofs all around. </p>
      <p>And then there's the man in the light grey suit and tie, whose face reads, <i>How long until Howard gets cut? </i></p>
      <p>As strange and hilarious as it is to see players get left hanging, LeBron is only the latest in a slew of NBA legends to airball a high five.</p>

      <p>Thanks to this montage from YouTube channel Hoops Card, you can watch Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin, and... LeBron James, again, feel the cold sting of a failed high five. It's as if it's a rite of passage for NBA stardom, which for LeBron, means it was going to happen sooner or later.</p>
