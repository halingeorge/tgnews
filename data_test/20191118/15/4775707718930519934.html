      <h3>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Datamine Reveals 200 Player Battle Royale</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 18 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>A data miner has trawled through <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare/achievements">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a>'s files on PC and found details relating to a 200 player battle royale mode, a map and perks.</p>

      <p>The data miner, u/Senescallo posted the new information up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dx4me0/battle_royale_coming_to_modern_warfare_map/?sort=new">Reddit</a>. Senescallo was responsible for finding over <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39396/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-customization-leak">250 customisable options in Modern Warfare</a> in a previous leak — Activision has since taken down his video of the leak with a copyright claim. The Reddit post details a Battle Royale Mode with a 200 player count with players being able to play either Solo, in Duos or as a four-person squad. The leak also reveals a list of zones, and points of interest. The new map includes the Ground War and Spec Ops inside it, which are both huge in themselves.</p>
      <p>There is also a respawn mechanic which involves looting Respawn Tokens. A player can use them on themselves once; then they become disabled. However, they can still be used on other teammates by obtaining a token and dropping their body near an ambulance. The player will then be entered into a 1v1 in the Gulag, and if successful will respawn into the match. Players can spectate other players fighting in the Gulag, with a countdown showing how long is left until you fight. According to the leak, a jailbreak can happen, kicking everyone back into the match.</p>
      <p>Players will also have the ability to place bets on players fighting in the Gulag using Plunder. Plunder is collected by completing missions (such as killing specific players) and eliminating enemies. Plunder can then be converted into XP at ATM machines; however, an alarm will sound alerting players to your presence while doing so.</p>
      <p>Missions can be started by finding tablets during the battle royale. Only one mission can be active for a squad at a time. Some of these missions include Assassination (eliminate specific player) and Domination (capture Domination Point).</p>
      <p>It is important to note that these leaks have not been confirmed and should be taken with a pinch of salt. However, the leaker has been accurate in the past. There is no date of when the 200-player battle royale could be coming to Modern Warfare; however, rumours are suggesting that it could be early 2020 as a standalone, free-to-play game mode.</p>
