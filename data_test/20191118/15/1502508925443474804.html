      <p>"The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi-police">Delhi Police </a>staff acted with restraint all along and, despite continued defiance by some groups of students, methods of persuasion were resorted to, and there was no use of water cannons, tear gas shells or lathi-charge at any stage of the protest," read the release.</p>
      <p>Apart from 10 companies of CAPF, around 800 <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi-police">Delhi Police </a>personnel were deployed to handle the protest and ensure the maintenance of law and order, it said.</p>
