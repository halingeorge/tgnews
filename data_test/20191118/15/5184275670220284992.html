      <p>Dhvani along with Millind can be seen fully immersed while performing the dance track.

The song makes you groove to it, and I, as an individual love dancing.”</p>

      <p>Millind Gaba shares his reasons for selecting Akh Lad Jaave and She Don’t Know for T-Series MixTape Punjabi Season 2. He informs, “These two songs already had been super hit blockbusters and I personally wanted to do something special with She Don’t Know. So we mutually chose these tracks.”</p>
      <p>Millind has been part of MixTape series in the earlier season as well. Describing his experience of T-Series MixTape Punjabi Season 2, the singer adds, “Bigger sets, bigger canvas and most importantly everyone on the set worked harder than before. Radhika ma’am and Vinay sir had a fabulous focus. I think they pulled it off amazingly!”</p>
      <p>Dressed in a bright, colourful attire, Millind ensured that he went out the whole hog. Director Radhika Rao even conferred on him the title of the best-dressed man on the show. Far from being shy, Millind has pulled out all stops to display his showmanship by dancing unabashedly as he belted out the track. In hindsight, he offers, “I just don’t know how to explain this. When on stage, I am totally a different Millind Gaba. I feel I have all the energies of the world and I perform as if there is no tomorrow. I cannot tell how my love for stage gradually has increased to a super high point in all these years.”</p>
