      <p>PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech government approved a 7% digital tax proposal on Monday aimed at boosting state coffers by taxing advertising by global internet giants like Google and Facebook, the Finance Ministry said.</p>
      <p>The proposed tax, which still must make it past lawmakers in parliament, covers revenue gained from targeted advertising, providing digital market places, and user data sales.</p>
      <p>It will be aimed at services provided to Czech users.</p>
      <p>It would apply to companies with global revenue over 750 million euros ($826.50 million) annually, 100 million crown ($4.32 million) turnover in the Czech market and a reach exceeding 200,000 user accounts.</p>
      <p>The Finance Ministry said it estimated the tax, which it said would be temporary until a global deal could be reached, will raise 2.1 billion crowns next year if it takes effect for June, and about 5 billion annually in following years.</p>
      <p>The Czech Republic has followed some other countries in Europe with the digital tax after the European Union (EU) failed to reach a bloc-wide agreement last year.</p>
      <p>The ministry said the Czech proposal was based on the earlier ideas for pan-European legislation.</p>
      <p>Similar moves by countries like France or Italy have upset the United States, home to the biggest internet players.</p>
