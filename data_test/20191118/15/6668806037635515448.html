      <p>Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a powerhouse performer and we all know it. Even in a small role, he manages to steal the show and walk away with the praises. His roles have  been edgy, dark and unconventional. However his recently released film, Motichoor Chaknachoor, is quite different from the films he has done previously.</p>

      <p>Nawazuddin plays a 37- year-old man, looking for a bride. Unlike his other roles, here he’s not holding a gun here nor swearing at the goons or even scheming and plotting destruction in the city. He just plays a simple man and he’s done a great job of it. When a daily asked him, why he opted for this film, he said that he wanted to do a light-hearted film for a long time. And also, he picked this role specifically because his li'l daughter, Shora, has not seen any of his films and he wanted her this film. </p>

      <p>Nawazuddin Siddiqui has time and again, proved his mettle and has always surprised us with his roles. Black, white or grey, he excels in every character he plays and yet make us root for him. </p>
