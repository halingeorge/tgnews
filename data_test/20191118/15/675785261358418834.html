      <h1>Man Utd handed huge Bruno Fernandes transfer boost and could land midfielder 'in January'</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd had their sights set on Bruno Fernandes in the summer and Sporting Lisbon's financial issues may open the door in January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:32:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> 's hopes of signing Portuguese star Bruno Fernandes have been enhanced.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils chased the Sporting Lisbon star for much of the summer but were unable to finalise a deal.</p>
      <p>Fernandes is valued at around Â£65 in the Portuguese capital, but Sporting have mounting debts that need clearing promptly.</p>
      <p>It could force their hand should United come knocking and a January move is not out of the question according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10367383/united-fernandes-january-sporting-debt/">The Sun</a> .</p>

      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer saw Ander Herrera leave for PSG in the summer without replacing the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>The majority of his current midfield options are also deemed below par and recruits are needed.</p>
      <p>Nemanja Matic is ageing while Fred has not impressed following his big money move from Shakhtar Donesk over a year ago.</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay is a rare bright light in the centre of the pitch which increases their need for a fresh impetus.</p>

      <p>Fernandes scored 31 times last season and could add a potent goal threat missing from United midfield.</p>
      <p>But they face competition from Premier League rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> who were understood to be the 25-year-old's first choice.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has made it known the time required to rebuild his side, but his relationship with Daniel Levy has been questioned.</p>
      <p>Signing Fernandes would be a major coup and provide the Argentine with the assurances he needs that he will be backed in the market.</p>
      <p>Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso were both added in the summer, but neither have lived up to expectations with the latter struggling for fitness having returned late from the Copa America.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have won just three games all year and had United for company in the bottom half of the Premier League before Solskjaer's side won two of their last three.</p>
