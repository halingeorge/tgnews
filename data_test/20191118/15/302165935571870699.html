      <p>PARIS, Nov 18 — Dividends paid by companies across the world to shareholders hit a record in the third quarter, according to a study released today, although further growth was likely to be weak.</p>
      <p>The amount shareholders received in dividends in the third quarter rose by 2.8 per cent from last year to hit US$355.3 billion (RM1.4 trillion), a record for the July-September period, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.</p>
      <p>“A slowdown in global dividend growth is underway,” said the report, adding “2020 likely to see a moderation in dividend growth given the global economic environment”.</p>
      <p>In the third quarter of last year dividend growth came in at 4.4 per cent.</p>
      <p>While the United States hit an all-time record for dividends, China showed weakness and Australia saw a decline, according to Janus Henderson, a major player in the asset management industry with more than 355 billion euros under management.</p>
      <p>Dividends in the Asia-Pacific region slid by 2.8 per cent, with Janus Henderson Investors noting that many firms there distribute a fixed percentage of profits in dividends.</p>
      <p>Janus Henderson said it had made no change in its forecast for 2019 — a 3.9 per cent increase to a record US$1.43 trillion in dividends. — AFP</p>
