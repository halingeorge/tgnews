      <h1>T-Mobile CEO John Legere is stepping down</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:50:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Manskar</a></address>
      <p>The man who took T-Mobile off life support and built it into the nation’s third-largest carriers said he’s leaving the company Monday — and Wall Street shrugged.</p>
      <p>Magenta-clad T-Mobile CEO John Legere said he will hand the reins of the company he rescued to his more straight-laced protege, Mike Sievert, the company’s president and chief operating officer, this spring.</p>
      <p>Shares of T-Mobile closed the day up flat to $78.19 a share.</p>
      <p>While Sievert lacks Legere’s trademark long hair and brash social media presence, analysts say they think he’s the right pick to carry on his boss’s legacy of growth without throwing a wrench in the No. 3 wireless carrier’s mega-merger with Sprint.</p>
      <p>“Our initial take is that this will be as undisruptive as a CEO transition will be,” Bernstein analysts Peter Supino and James McNeill wrote in a Monday report. “We think T-Mobile is well past the point of needing a big personality to gain attention, as its consumer ‘premium value’ proposition is now entrenched.”</p>
      <p>Legere’s departure — slated for April 30 when his contract expires — comes amid bumps in the road on his latest project: T-Mobile’s $26 billion acquisition of Sprint, the nation’s fourth-largest cellular carrier.</p>
      <p>The US Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission have <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/26/justice-department-oks-t-mobiles-26-5m-acquisition-of-sprint/">approved the deal</a>, but attorneys general in New York and other states <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/11/ny-attorney-general-spearheads-new-challenge-of-t-mobile-sprint-merger/">sued to block it</a> in June. A trial in the case is set for Dec. 9, more than a month after the Nov. 1 expiration of the two companies’ tie-up agreement.</p>
      <p>Legere said he’s been working with T-Mobile’s board of directors for “the past few years” to identify his successor. The search landed on Sievert, who was one of Legere’s first hires when he landed at the company in 2012. Legere called him “my mentee, my secret weapon and my friend.”</p>
      <p>The outgoing chief executive plans to focus on completing the Sprint merger and making sure the leadership change goes smoothly in the coming months, he said. Legere will still be a member of T-Mobile’s board.</p>
      <p>“Mike is well prepared to lead T-Mobile into the future,” Legere said in a news release. “He has a deep understanding of where T-Mobile has been and where it needs to go to remain the most innovative company in the industry.”</p>
      <p>Legere and Sievert have turned the once-struggling company into the market’s fastest-growing wireless provider through <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/t-mobile-dangles-15-cell-deal-ahead-of-potential-sprint-merger/">aggressive cost-cutting</a> and by simplifying cellular plans. One of their signature moves was to do away with contracts that bound customers to a wireless provider for a certain period of time.</p>
      <p>Sievert said his aim as CEO will be “to position T-Mobile not only as the leading mobile carrier, but as one of the most admired companies in America.”</p>
      <p>Sievert is not as active on social media as Legere, and his style is a little softer around the edges, analysts say. But his marketing expertise and close involvement in T-Mobile’s growth will make for a relatively smooth transition at the top with the Sprint merger in its final stages, according to experts.</p>
      <p>“He and Legere are more alike in personality than dislike in their personality,” said John Butler, a senior telecom analyst at Bloomberg. “They’re both promoters, both of them. They’re peas in a pod.”</p>
      <p>Legere announced his departure days after a report that he would not take over as chief executive of WeWork, the troubled office subleasing giant. Legere had no plans to move to WeWork despite being a candidate to succeed ousted ex-CEO Adam Neumann, CNBC reported Friday.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear why T-Mobile made the leadership change public at a time when the Sprint merger still has at least one legal hurdle to clear. But it’s likely time for a new kind of leader to usher the company through the next stage of its life, according to Butler.</p>
      <p>“John Legere has done a superb job turning T-Mobile around and restoring it to health,” Butler said. “It’s now of a size where just naturally it’s going to move into a more mature phase of growth given the lack of a need to turn it around anymore.”</p>
