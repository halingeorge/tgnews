      <p>The registrar-general(RG)’s office has announced that  it will hike up its fees in a bid to retain enough foreign currency needed to produce sufficient passports for Zimbabweans,</p>
      <p>Registrar-General Clemence Masango said the existing passport fees were not economical and needed an urgent review to reflect the current economic situation in the country.</p>
      <blockquote>“The matter (of increasing fees) is now with Treasury. They have the final say on the adjustments after we have advised them.<br/>“The process is underway … If there is a change in fees or anything to do with policy that will be properly communicated;’ Masango said.<br/><br/>An ordinary passport currently costs $53 —while urgent passports issued within working days cost $253. Express passports which are issued within 24 hours cost $318, and temporary travel documents cost $38.<br/><br/>These fees were last increased during the era of the multi-currency system when bond notes were pegged at parity with the United States dollar.<br/><br/>As a result, the RG’s office has not been able to process passports and other critical documents on time, owing to the acute shortages of foreign currency in the country.</blockquote>
