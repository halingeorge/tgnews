      <p><b>The now-relegated Tornado were really playing for pride<br/></b> <br/><u>UCA Men’s National Cricket League<br/></u> <br/><i>Division 1 results<br/></i> <br/><i>Challengers 466/6 Tornado 61/9<br/></i> <br/><i>(Challengers win by 405 runs)<br/></i> <br/><i>Kutchi 235/7 KICC 155/10<br/></i> <br/><i>(Kutchi win by 80 runs)<br/></i> <br/><b>It was not expected to be competitive but even then, a 405-run victory for the Challengers over Tornado in their UCA Men’s National Division 1 Cricket League encounter Sunday at Entebbe was a bit of a shocker.<br/></b> <br/>Sure, the now-relegated Tornado were really playing for pride while the Challengers are hunting for the championship, this win giving them a twelve-point lead on Aziz Damani atop the standings, but the lop-sidedness of the result is almost concerning.<br/> <br/>Maybe it underscores the thirst of the Challengers, who have become perennial title bridesmaids and will be praying reigning two-time champions Damani drop one of their three games in hand.<br/> <br/>Arnold Otwani helped himself to a century (115 runs off 108 balls) while Trevor Bukenya (80), Steven Wabwose (74) and Zephania Arinaitwe (64) all picked up half-centuries against a Tornado team that only had 10 players.<br/> <br/>The record national champions will play in the second division for the second time in three years after a systemic collapse that shows no signs of ending soon. Maxwell Torach, with 2/72 was Tornado’s most notable performer.</p>
