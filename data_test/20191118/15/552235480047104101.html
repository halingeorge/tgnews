      <p>LIVELY Highland band Hò-Rò are set to light up this year’s Gaelic Awards with their brand of traditional and contemporary music.</p>
      <p>The musicians will entertain the finalists, judges and guests at the prestigious awards ceremony on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Daily Record and Bòrd na Gàidhlig Gaelic Awards pay tribute to all aspects of Gaelic culture, education and language.</p>
      <p>And the band will provide the entertainment as the winners step on to the stage at the event, hosted by broadcaster Cathy Macdonald.</p>
      <p>Calum MacPhail, Hò-Rò’s vocalist and accordionist, said: “This is the first time we have been asked to play at the Gaelic Awards.</p>
      <p>“We are really pleased and it will be great to be among the Gaelic community and help celebrate its achievements.”</p>
      <p>The band, who have six members, released their debut album in 2016.</p>
      <p>The line-up features traditional Highland music instruments – bagpipes, border pipes, accordion, fiddle, bodhran and whistles – along with the more contemporary guitar, keyboards and drums.</p>
      <p>Hò-Rò, who won the Up &amp; Coming Artist of the Year prize at the BBC Traditional Music Awards in 2017, play Scottish music with a contemporary twist, as well as more recent compositions, including their own.</p>
      <p>“We are firmly rooted in the musical traditions of the places where we belong – the Outer Hebrides, Argyll, Lochaber, Inverness and the Isle of Lewis,” added Calum.</p>
      <p>“Our repertoire includes well-known folk ballads, songs of love, longing, scandal and praise and the infectious rhythms of Gaelic mouth music, puirt-a-beul.</p>
      <p>“We love to get the audience singing and dancing along.</p>
      <p>“Sharing some great Highland craic with the audience is at the centre of our performances and much of our feedback highlights this atmosphere of energy andfun.”</p>
      <p>The award finalists were selected by judges Mairi Kidd, head of literature, languages and publishing at Creative Scotland, Daibhidh Boag, director of language planning and developing communities, Bòrd na Gàidhlig, Ruairidh Graham, Historic Environment Scotland, and judges’ chair Cathy.</p>
      <p>Cathy said: “This year we received glowing recommendations across a variety of disciplines.</p>
      <p>“It’s a measure of how far-reaching the scope is, once again, that many of the names and projects on the shortlist were unknown to me.</p>
      <p>“The awards acknowledge the work, and celebrate the achievements of, a number of individuals who selflessly give their time and passion to the language and the culture.</p>
      <p>“Their commitment deserves recognition and we are indebted to those who nominate them for shining a light on what is happening at grassroots level.</p>
      <p>“It’s also heartening to see the work done by those new to the language, as well as those who have been its custodians for many years.</p>
      <p>“I can’t wait to hear the cheers in the room when the recipients’ names are read on the night.”</p>
      <p>The Gaelic Awards ceremony will take place on Tuesday at the Glasgow Marriott Hotel.</p>
