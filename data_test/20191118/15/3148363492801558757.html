      <h2>President Donald Trump said Monday he would “strongly consider” testifying for the House Democrat-led impeachment probe.</h2>

      <p>“Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” Trump wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The president responded to a challenge from Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who invited him to testify to the committee.</p>
      <p>“The president could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants,” Pelosi said in an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nancy-pelosi-face-the-nation-trump-has-every-opportunity-to-present-his-case-in-impeachment-inquiry/">interview</a> on Sunday’s <i>Face the Nation</i> on CBS News.</p>
      <p>Trump described Pelosi as a “crazy, do nothing” Speaker who was “petrified” by the leftists in her caucus, and criticized her for failing to pass the USMCA trade deal, infrastructure and lower drug prices.</p>
      <p>Trump has appeared willing to testify during investigations in the past, which his White House lawyers typically advised against.</p>
