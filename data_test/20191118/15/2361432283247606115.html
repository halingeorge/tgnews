      <h2>And about all those Instagram comments…</h2>

      <p>This is NOT what Sara Lee needs right before Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>On Saturday’s “SNL,” host Harry Styles played the food brand’s fictional Instagram manager in a sketch where he’s confronted by Sara Lee employees, played by members Cecily Strong and Bowen Yang, who are concerned about the activity they’ve seen on Sara Lee’s IG.</p>
      <p>Apparently, Style’s character Dylan has been “mixing up” the Sara Lee Instagram account and his personal Instagram account resulting in Sara Lee writing comments like “Wreck me daddy” and “Destroy me king” on a photo of Nick Jonas.</p>
      <p>He’s also been captioning pictures of Sara Lee products with statements like, “Feeling really depressed after threesome. What was supposed to be a fantasy ended up more rejection. Must get rid of toxic in community,” and, “A little moody after being used. Why do guys freak out when I ask them to spit in mouth? Need a real king that can handle. It’s 8 am and have to go to hell job at sara lee. A little in my head after another threesome.”</p>

      <p>You can watch the sketch in question above.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t participate in creating the skit and its content doesn’t align with Sara Lee Bread’s brand,” a Sara Lee spokeswoman told TheWrap on Monday. “But, we all know ‘SNL’ pushes the envelope for laughs and we are taking it in stride.”</p>
      <p>“We didn’t know about or participate in the creation of the skit so as you can imagine, waking up to all those comments threw us for a bit of a loop,” the spokeswoman said. “We didn’t delete any comments but did temporarily hide them until we could read through and understand what happened.</p>
      <p>“All comments are now visible and we will be monitoring for any that violate Instagram standards. While the explicit jokes in the skit do not align with Sara Lee Bread’s brand, we know ‘SNL’ pushes the envelope for laughs and are taking it all in stride,” the statement added.</p>
