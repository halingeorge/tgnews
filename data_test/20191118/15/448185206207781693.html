      <p><b>Whangarei</b><b>:</b> England batsman Joe Denly is looking forward to scoring his first Test century in the New Zealand Test series after missing out on the T20 Internationals due to injury.</p>
      <p>“I was very disappointed when (I got injured) just before the T20 series,” Denly was quoted as saying by ICC.</p>
      <p>“When I first did it, I was probably thinking my tour was over. It was pretty nasty, a tough one to take, and it always touches and goes to get ready for this game (against New Zealand A).”</p>
      <p>Denly made a half-century on his return against New Zealand A in the warm-up game here.</p>
      <p>“It’s settled down nicely. There’s no discomfort. The running between the wickets and playing all the shots feels fine. It’s just a case of monitoring it and making sure it doesn’t swell up,” said Denly, who smashed seven fours and three sixes in his knock of 68.</p>
      <p>Denly made his Test debut against West Indies in January this year and has already scored four fifties in eight matches for England.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old came close to scoring a hundred in the second innings of the final Ashes Test at the Oval in September but fell six runs short.</p>
      <p>“It was disappointing not to get three figures, but I was dropped on naught and I could have had an lbw shout against me as well,” he said. “Playing in the Ashes, being exposed to those bowlers, I’ve come out of it as a more confident player, and I certainly feel a lot more comfortable within this batting line-up now.</p>
      <p>“It would be nice to get that first Test hundred on this trip. I’m feeling pretty good out in the middle.” IANS</p>
