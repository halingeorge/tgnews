He shared his list with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/">Business Insider</a> so that we could round up the 15 most expensive residential sales the country has seen over the past 10 years.</p>
      <p>From a number of $100 million mansions to one nearly $240 million penthouse, 14 out of the 15 homes that made the list are located in either <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/florida">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/new-york">New York,</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/california">California</a> – three states with notoriously expensive housing markets.</p>
      <p>The only sale that didn’t take place in those markets was a 50-acre property in Greenwich, Connecticut; that home sold for $120 million in 2014.</p>
