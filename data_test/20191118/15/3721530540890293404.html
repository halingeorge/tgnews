      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/animal-crossing-pocket-camp/40236"><i>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</i></a> is getting a paid subscription service soon, similar to the one in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/mario-kart-tour/40541"><i>Mario Kart Tour</i></a>.</p>
      <p>An in-game notice said that there will be two different plans for the subscription service. One plans lets you set a villager as your “camp caretaker” and one where you’ll get Fortune Cookies (the game’s loot boxes) and the ability to store furniture and clothes in a “warehouse.” At this time, we don’t know the specifics of what the warehouse is or what the camp caretakers do exactly. No price was listed either.</p>

      <p><i>Animal Crossing</i><i>: Pocket Camp</i>’s monetization <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/31/20942068/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-2-years-later">has gotten iffier since its release</a>. This month marks the second anniversary of the game’s release and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ACPocketCamp/comments/dxnpv3/thank_you_nintendo_very_cool/">players were less than thrilled</a> to see the notice for the upcoming paid service mixed among the announcements of free celebratory items.</p>
      <p>If it’s anything like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/25/20883283/mario-kart-tour-gold-pass-features-price"><i>Mario Kart Tour</i>’s subscription service</a>, it’ll be a $4.99 price tag on getting monthly special goodies.</p>
      <p>More details about the subscription service will be revealed through videos that will release on Nov. 20.</p>
