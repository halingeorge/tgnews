      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-does-kylie-jenner-make-money-2018-7">Kylie Jenner</a> has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kylie-jenner-sells-600-million-stake-in-beauty-business-11574084772">sold a majority stake</a> in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hollywood-celebrity-billionaires-oprah-jay-z-kylie-jenner-2019-6">Kylie Cosmetics</a> to beauty conglomerate Coty Inc.</p>
      <p>Coty, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kylie-jenner-sells-600-million-stake-in-beauty-business-11574084772">owned by the European investment firm JAB Ltd.</a>, acquired a 51% controlling stake in the company for $600 million, valuing the brand at $1.2 billion. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kylie-jenner-sells-600-million-stake-in-beauty-business-11574084772">The Wall Street Journal reports that</a> Jenner will remain the "public face" of the brand.</p>
      <p>Jenner founded the brand in 2015, and it quickly became successful. In 2017, two years after its launch, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2018/07/11/how-20-year-old-kylie-jenner-built-a-900-million-fortune-in-less-than-3-years/#7f836fc1aa62">Forbes reported that the brand</a> already had a valuation of $800 million, with Jenner, at the time, on track to become the youngest self-made billionaire in history. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-jenner-luxury-car-collection-bugatti-rolls-royce">She achieved this feat just two years later</a>, in June 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2018/07/11/how-20-year-old-kylie-jenner-built-a-900-million-fortune-in-less-than-3-years/#7f836fc1aa62">according to Forbes. </a></p>
      <p>Coty said in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kylie-jenner-sells-600-million-stake-in-beauty-business-11574084772">statement</a> that Jenner's brand is set to bring in roughly $200 million in sales this year.</p>
      <p>Known primarily known for <a href="https://www.coty.com/brands">their brands</a> CoverGirl, Clairol hair dye, and OPI nail polish, Coty has struggled with weak sales in recent years, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kylie-jenner-sells-600-million-stake-in-beauty-business-11574084772">WSJ</a> reports. The Wall Street Journal's Sharon Terlep reported in early November that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/beauty-giant-coty-tries-on-a-smaller-size-11572874045?mod=article_inline">the beauty conglomerate was restructuring</a> and had experienced high executive turnover, with Coty on its third CEO in as many years. With this deal, Coty will refocus on revitalizing its flagging beauty division.</p>
      <p>"This new partnership between Kylie and Coty is an exciting step in Coty's renewed emphasis on its beauty business," Peter Harf, Coty's Chairman of the Board, <a href="https://www.coty.com/in-the-news/press-release/coty-and-kylie-jenner-announce-strategic-partnership-expand-beauty-brands">said in a press release</a> about the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. "Kylie is a modern-day icon, with an incredible sense of the beauty consumer, and we believe in the high potential of building a global beauty brand together."</p>
      <p>Coty's shares <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/coty-buys-majority-stake-in-kylie-cosmetics-shares-jump.html">jumped 6%</a> upon the initial announcement of the acquisition; the company's stock is currently <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/coty-stock">trading up a little over 2%</a>.</p>
      <p>A representative for Kylie Cosmetics declined to comment further when reached by Business Insider. Representatives for Coty didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>
