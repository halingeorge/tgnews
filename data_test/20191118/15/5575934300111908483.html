      <p>The racket which Serena Williams smashed during her 2018 US Open Final defeat to Naomi Osaka is up for auction, and could fetch up to $US50,000.</p>
      <p>Williams infamously destroyed the “Wilson Blade” midway through the second set of the match, shortly after being accused of coaching by the umpire on the day Carlos Ramos.</p>
      <p>She received a code violation for the outburst, and later a game penalty from the resulting argument. After losing to Osaka 6-2, 6-4, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/serena-williams-cant-remember-the-umpire-she-accused-of-sexism-2019-8">she then labelled Ramos a “sexist” and a “thief.”</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://goldinauctions.com/2018_Serena_Williams_US_Open_Finals_Match_Used_Ten-LOT55009.aspx">The racket is now up for sale on Goldin Auctions</a> and already has a bid of $US2,100. However, that figure is expected to rise significantly before the auction closes.</p>
      <p>“I think the low end would be $US10,000, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it goes to $US25,000 or $US50,000,” Ken Goldin, the founder of Goldin Auctions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/sports/tennis/serena-williams-racket-auction.html">told The New York Times.</a></p>
      <p>The piece of memorabilia came up for sale by way of a US Open ball boy named Justin Arrington-Holmes, who told The Times that Williams said he could keep it after the match.</p>
      <p>Holmes, however, unaware of its potential value, then sold it, alongside a certificate of its authenticity, on to a buyer for a meager $US500, and it’s since made its way to Goldin Auctions.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear whether the person who bought the racket from Holmes is now the seller, as they asked to remain anonymous, says The Times.</p>
      <p>The auction ends on December 7.</p>
