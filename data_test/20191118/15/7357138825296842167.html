      <h1>Yahoo! Japan Strikes 50-50 Merger Deal With LINE</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:27:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>SoftBank’s Yahoo! Japan is merging with Naver Corp’s Japanese messaging app LINE in a deal that will give each company a 50 percent stake, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-japan-and-chat-app-line-agree-to-merge-11574040785">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported on Monday (Nov. 18).</p>
      <p>The deal creates a mega-platform with more than 100 million users across financial services, eCommerce and more. <a href="https://line.me/en/">LINE</a> is Japan’s most popular chat app with 82 million monthly users, putting it far ahead of both Instagram and Facebook in the country.</p>
      <p>The tender offer for LINE’s remaining shares will be ¥5,200, a 13.41 percent premium over the Nov. 13 closing price of LINE’s common shares, according to a <a href="https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/set/data/news/press/sbkk/2019/20191118_02/pdf/20191118_02.pdf">SoftBank</a> memorandum.</p>
      <p>The merger is expected to be completed in October 2020 and values LINE at ¥1.3 trillion. The combined group has a market value of ¥3.3 trillion with $11 billion in combined revenue.</p>
      <p>Kentaro Kawabe, CEO of <a href="https://about.yahoo.co.jp/info/en/company/">Yahoo! Japan</a>’s parent, told WSJ that “the SoftBank-Naver joint venture would hold 65 percent of that company and the rest would be owned by minority shareholders.”</p>
      <p>According to analysts, the combined company could end up as a formidable competitor in Japan to Google and Amazon.</p>
      <p>“We were driven by a sense of crisis about global competition and the pace of change in AI,” Takeshi Idezawa, co-chief executive at LINE, said at a joint press conference in Tokyo, as the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c4c081ec-09b2-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">Financial Times</a> reported. “The timing arrived for us to move on to the next phase [with this merger].”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2019/line-digital-payments-business/">In February</a>, LINE was planning to invest ¥20 billion ($182 million) into its payments business in an effort to grow that area of its operations. The company said it sees a big in Japan as the government aims to get people used to digital payments at the 2020 Olympic Games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://pay.line.me/portal/global/main">LINE Pay</a> is also available in Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia. It used to be available in Singapore until it was forced to shut down operations in February.</p>
