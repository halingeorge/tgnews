      <p>As you know, Marvel Studios has revealed a new collector’s edition set for The Infinity Saga that includes all 23 Marvel movies, and it’s packed with all kinds of special features. The set will feature a ton of never before seen deleted and bonus scenes <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/marvel-studios-is-planning-to-release-film-footage-that-theyve-been-too-humiliated-to-show">previously teased</a> by Marvel Studios president, <b>Kevin Fiege</b>.</p>
      <p>Well, we now have details to share with you regarding the extra footage that fans will be able to enjoy. The information comes from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/dx1a7w/captain_marvel_was_originally_going_to_appear_in/f7mwr3q/">Reddit</a> user TMOTS2099:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The deleted scene from Iron Man with Nick Fury which was <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/kevin-feige-shares-unused-iron-man-post-credits-scene-with-nick-fury-mentioning-mutants">released already</a>.</li>
        <li>The scene from Iron Man 2 with the video recording of his dad.</li>
        <li>An alternate ending for Thor 2 in which Thor and Jane break up.</li>
        <li>The scene from Age of Ultron with Captain Marvel.</li>
        <li>An extended scene from Ant Man that shows Hank being a badass in Panama.</li>
        <li>An alternate scene from Civil war in which Zemo steals the red book from an auction by poisoning everyone.</li>
        <li>A scene from Doctor Strange that mentions Mordo.</li>
        <li>The scene from Thor Ragnarok in which Hela comes from an Alley in New York and Odin is homeless.</li>
        <li>A scene from Black Panther in which Okoye interacts more with agent Ross.</li>
        <li>Test footage for the Black Order.</li>
        <li>A scene with Hulk Busting out of the Hulkbuster in Infinity War</li>
        <li>That scene that leaked a long time ago from Infinity War in which Doctor Strange tells Peter to "Save them" meaning the Guardians, everyone thought it was fake but it turned out to be real.</li>
        <li>Smart Hulk interacting with Natasha in Infinity War.</li>
        <li>A scene from Ant Man and the Wasp in which Janet and Pym are looking for the Egghead guy which causes the explosion that creates Ghost.</li>
        <li>A scene in the quantum realm in which Janet saves Hank.</li>
        <li>A scene from Captain Marvel with a comic accurate Supreme Intelligence.</li>
        <li>Some test footage with Smart Hulk.</li>
        <li>Thor at the end of Endgame trying to kiss Valkyrie but she rejects him.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’ll be fun to eventually watch these and discuss them. I’m curious to see how some of these scenes play out. The Infinity Saga box set was briefly available at Best Buy, and it appears to have sold out completely. I’m sure that they will get restocked if you weren’t able to grab one of them.</p>
      <p>Do you plan on picking up The Infinity Saga set?</p>
