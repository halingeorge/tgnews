      <h1>Liverpool fans will love what Spurs and Man United target James Maddison posted on Twitter</h1>
      <h2>The Leicester midfielder sent the message on Twitter to his England teammate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:40:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>James Maddison has praised England teammate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after the Liverpool midfielder's international comeback.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal star started in both of England's Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo, scoring in the 7-0 win over the former last Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has suffered dreadful luck with injuries for club and country in recent years, missing out on several major tournaments with serious muscle problems.</p>
      <p>But the clash against Montenegro was his first start for England in 19 months, and Roy Keane believes the Liverpool midfielder will be an asset for Jurgen Klopp and Gareth Southgate moving forward.</p>
      <p>“The few games he’s been involved in recently, he does look sharp,” Keane said on ITV.</p>
      <p>“I know he’s probably not up to speed but he’s had a tough time.</p>
      <p>“I like the look of him and when you’ve got a midfielder who’s a goal threat and can put the ball in the back of the net, then it’s a huge plus.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to see him back because he’s had a difficult time but he’s certainly a talented boy.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to ITV Sport ahead of the Kosovo clash, Oxlade-Chamberlain opened up about the knee ligament injury sustained in 2018 which kept him out of the World Cup that summer.</p>
      <p>He said: "Oh yeah, that was a car crash, wasn't it? [laughs].</p>
      <p>"Watching the World Cup was very difficult. You're missing out on something that could've been. But over a while, I became a fan and loved every minute of it. I've never seen it - how much it means to everyone.</p>
      <p>"It kept me going, kept me motivated to come back."</p>
      <p>England teammate Maddison, who came on during the Montenegro clash for his full senior debut, retweeted Oxlade-Chamberlain's interview and also wrote: 'This video sums him up as a guy. Right out the top draw.'</p>

      <p>The Leicester midfielder was included in the England squad after a hugely impressive start to the season for Brendan Rodgers' side.</p>
      <p>The Foxes sit second in the Premier League after their 2-0 win over Arsenal before the international break, and look well set to finish in the top four.</p>
      <p>Maddison has been linked with Tottenham and Manchester United in recent transfer windows, and reports claim Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are still interested in signing the former Coventry and Norwich star.</p>
