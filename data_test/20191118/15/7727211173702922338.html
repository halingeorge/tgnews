      <p>The death of a man at a care home is being treated as "unexplained" by police.</p>
      <p>Police and the North West Ambulance Service were called to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liscard">St Martins in Liscard,</a> at around 4.30pm on Saturday, after a resident had become unresponsive.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old was <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wallasey">taken to hospital</a> where he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.</p>
      <p>The death is currently <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/north-west-ambulance-service">being treated as unexplained.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Merseyside Police</a> told the ECHO the man's death is not being treated as suspicious.</p>
      <p>He has been formally identified, next of kin have been informed and a Home Office post mortem will take place to establish the cause of death.</p>
      <p>A manager for St Martins declined to comment.</p>
