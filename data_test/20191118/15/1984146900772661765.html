      <h2>Sunderland head to Gillingham for their FA Cup first round replay tomorrow, and the Black Cats' squad is severely depleted</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland will draft in seven members of their U23 squad for tomorrow's FA Cup first round replay at Gillingham as the Black Cats struggle with international call-ups and injuries.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Black Cats</a> have four players away on international duty - <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jon-mclaughlin">Jon McLaughlin</a> , <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conor-mclaughlin">Conor McLaughlin</a> , <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tom-flanagan">Tom Flanagan</a> , and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/benjamin-kimpioka">Benji Kimpioka</a> - while <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jordan-willis">Jordan Willis</a> (knee), <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joel-lynch">Joel Lynch</a> (back), <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/marc-mcnulty">Marc McNulty</a> (hamstring), and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/george-dobson">George Dobson</a> (hamstring), have been added to an injury list that already included <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charlie-wyke">Charlie Wyke</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lynden-gooch">Lynden Gooch</a> (both ankle), and long-term absentee <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/elliot-embleton">Elliot Embleton</a> (hamstring).</p>
      <p>And that has led <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> to include in his squad young midfielder <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bali-mumba">Bali Mumba</a> , defenders Jack Bainbridge and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/brandon-taylor">Brandon Taylor</a> , and forward Lee Connelly, all of whom have played at first-team level, along with goalkeeper <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/anthony-patterson">Anthony Patterson</a> , midfielder Ruben Sammut, and winger Cieran Dunne, who have yet to make their senior debuts.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: "We have had lads who have been playing with issues that our medical department felt needed clearing up.</p>
      <p>"Jordan Willis has had an injection in his knee, Joel Lynch has had an epidural in his back, and those two players will be out.</p>
      <p>"George Dobson has an ongoing problem which needs a bit of time to get right.</p>
      <p>"They are not serious problems, but they need clearing up before we go into this run of league games, and that's why we have included seven younger lads in the squad."</p>
      <p>Will Grigg will also return to the squad after he missed last week's EFL Trophy defeat at Scunthorpe United due to a sickness bug, and Alim Ozturk is also available after recovering from a back injury.</p>

      <p>Wyke is edging closer to fitness but Parkinson is wary about pressing the striker back into action before he is fully ready, after losing him to injury in his first game in charge at Wycombe last month.</p>
      <p>He said: "Charlie is getting closer. He has done a lot of work on the training pitch this week but we just have to be careful that we don't push him too hard and end up losing him long-term, because he is eager to get back out there and he is a tough lad."</p>
      <p>Gooch twisted his ankle in the game at Shrewsbury last month and is taking longer to heal.</p>
      <p>"Goochy is not quite at the same level as Charlie, unfortunately - he faces another injection on Thursday," said Parkinson.</p>
      <p>"He's done some running so, physically, he is in good shape but it's an ankle ligament problem so it's about contact and striking a ball."</p>
      <p>Both Sunderland and Burton Albion - who also face an FA Cup replay tomorrow, in their case at home to Salford United - have seen their squads depleted by injuries and international call-ups, and they explored the possibility of postponing their league meeting at the Stadium of Light next Tuesday, and playing their cup games on that date instead.</p>
      <p>But while the EFL were willing to move the league game, the FA considered the request before deciding not to allow the cup games to be switched.</p>
      <p>And it was that delay that led to the late confirmation of Sunderland's cup replay date, with tomorrow's match only confirmed last Thursday.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: "There was talk of that [moving the games], and the FA took a while to decide that we couldn't do it.</p>
      <p>"It's a bit of a loophole, really, that you can call a league game off because of international call-ups but not an FA Cup replay.</p>
      <p>"They looked at it very, very, closely and decided against it, but they promised that they would review the rules for next season.</p>
      <p>"That's what was said to us and we will go ahead with it, but Burton were equally as frustrated as we are."</p>
