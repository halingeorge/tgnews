      <p>Anyone who has owned a smartphone will know the pain of dropping it and watching the screen shatter into a thousand pieces.</p>
      <p>But new research has found that a fifth of the 1,071 people surveyed have a cracked screen.</p>
      <p>The survey, carried out by Protect Your Bubble, found that one in six had a screen so cracked that they struggled to read on it.</p>
      <p>Half of those with severely cracked screens also admitted that it hurt for them to touch their screen – due to glass splinters.</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>
      <p>There were some interesting findings, in terms of age, too.</p>
      <p>According to the data, 16-24 year-olds were three times more likely to drop their phones than over 55s.</p>
      <p>It also found that men were more likely to get their phones fixed within the first week of breaking it – 40% of men said they would do so, compared to just 31% of women.</p>

      <p>What’s more, being drunk often plays a role in phone damage – with 8% confessing they dropped their phone whilst they were drinking.</p>
      <p>This rises to 17% amongst 25-34 year-olds.</p>
      <p>James Brown, director of gadget insurance provider at Protect Your Bubble, said: ‘Considering that the smartphone has become such a huge part of our everyday life, and the workhorse of the gadget world, it’s surprising that so many of us are happy to soldier on with cracked screens that are barely readable and in many cases painful to touch.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe an obstructed view is not such an issue when texting or calling, but we also use our smartphones for day-to-day tasks such as paying bills, bank account transfers, online shopping and in car sat navs, when a clear view may be more critical.’</p>

      <h3>Phone protection</h3>
      <p>The study also found that more than half (52%) said they spent less than a tenner on a phone case, and a third said they spent less than £5.</p>
      <p>Figures which seem somewhat surprising considering how much smartphones are worth.</p>
      <p>When it comes to repairs, taking out insurance is the best way to cut the costs. Many companies cover left and loss, too.</p>
      <p>Applying a clear screen protector is also another great way to help minimise damage.</p>
      <h3>What to do if a phone smashes?</h3>

      <p>Most insurance companies offer screen repairs for accidental damage.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there are plenty of shops which offer one-off screen repairs. Prices tend to vary depending on the model.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth making sure that the repair – carried out by either an insurer or a retailer – will not invalidate your phone’s warranty.</p>
