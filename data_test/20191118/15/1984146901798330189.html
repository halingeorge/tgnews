      <p>While he let his dancing do the talking to great aplomb on Saturday night, Chris Ramsey got Strictly Come Dancing viewers talking for a whole different reason!</p>
      <p>And attention on the South Shields' comedian's bulge has escalated so much that it even has its own Twitter account.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/chris-ramsey-survives-fiery-tango-17230944">Chris</a> and professional partner Karen Hauer opened the live show at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool in serious style at the weekend with a high octane <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/chris-ramsey-opens-strictly-come-17269358">Salsa to Mark Ronson &amp; Bruno Mars' worldwide smash Uptown Funk.</a></p>
      <p>Their routine had the audience and some of the judges on their feet and earned Chris &amp; Karen a score of 33, their second highest to date, just behind the score for THAT <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/chris-ramsey-lets-get-rhumble-17191618">Let's Get Ready to Rhumble dance.</a></p>
      <p>But, after the dust had settled on what was a spectacular night of fancy footwork, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> fans were talking about something else...namely Chris' bulge, with one tweeting "Completely distracted by Chris's crotch."</p>
      <p>His wife Rosie even got on the act. Uploading a zoomed in screen grab of Chris in some VERY tight pink trousers, she joked "</p>

      <p>"You guys didn’t think I married him for his personality did you?!?! . Oh you did?? .. That’s embarrassing."</p>
      <p>Rosie was actually referenced in another fan tweet, with someone posting "Rosie is a lucky woman."</p>
      <p>And now the bulge has it's own Twitter account. Called Chris Ramsey's Bulge, with the handle @BulgeChris, the account's bio reads "I am the monster which lurks inside the undergarments of Chris ‘The Package’ Ramsey and I am a grower."</p>
      <p>So far Chris hasn't followed the account but we reckon it's only a matter of time!</p>
