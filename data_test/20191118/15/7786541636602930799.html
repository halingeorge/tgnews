      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - U.S. stocks moved lower in early trading Monday as investors assessed mixed signals from the latest round of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.</p>
      <p>Media reports early Monday suggested that China is pessimistic about a deal because of U.S. reluctance to ease existing tariffs. That conflicted with a report from China's state media over the weekend that said negotiators had constructive discussions.</p>
      <p>Trade negotiations between the world's two largest economies have become the main focus for the market as the latest round of corporate earnings comes to a close. The broader market has been rallying for weeks and major indexes are still trading near record highs set on Friday.</p>
      <p>Technology stocks made some of the biggest declines in the early going. Broadcom fell 1.4% and Cisco fell 1%.</p>
      <p>Oil prices dipped 1% and weighed on energy stocks. Exxon Mobil fell 1.1% and Chevron fell 1.3%.</p>
      <p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.81% from 1.83% late Friday.</p>
      <p>Investors leaned toward safe-play holdings. Procter &amp; Gamble and Coca-Cola both rose just under 1%. Utilities and real estate companies also held up better than the rest of the market.</p>
      <p>KEEPING SCORE: The S&amp;P 500 index fell 0.2% as of 10:21 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12 points to 27,992. The Nasdaq fell 0.3%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell 0.4%.</p>
      <p>European markets moved lower and Asian markets made gains.</p>
      <p>WEEK AHEAD: Several important retailers will report earnings this week and close out the latest round of corporate results. More than 90% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported their latest earnings.</p>
      <p>Home improvement retailer Home Depot will report results on Tuesday. Target and Lowe's will report results on Wednesday. Macy's and Gap will release their earnings on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Investors will get a more detailed look at the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut interest rates when the central bank releases minutes from its October meeting on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>LOW INK: Computer and printer maker HP fell 1.1% after rejecting Xerox's roughly $33.5 billion takeover offer, saying it was too low.</p>
      <p>HP also said it was concerned about Xerox's debt. Both companies have faced difficulties as the demand for printed documents and ink have waned. Xerox fell just under 1%.</p>
