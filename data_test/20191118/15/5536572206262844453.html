      <p>The New England Patriots took a trip to Philly fresh off their first loss of the season and a bye week ready to get back on the winning track.</p>
      <p>That’s exactly what they did with a 17-10 victory that moved the Patriots to 9-1 on the season with Philadelphia dropping to 5-5.</p>
      <p>In the midst of that game was a battle between Eagles tight end Zach Ertz and one of the best cover guys in the NFL, New England cornerback Stephon Gilmore.</p>
      <p>Following the matchup, Gilmore had something to say about Ertz and he did not mince words.</p>
