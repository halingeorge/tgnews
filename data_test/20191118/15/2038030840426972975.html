      <p>Cape Town – Kick off the week with three brand new series. </p>
      <p>From an Australian hit drama, to the long-awaited fourth season of Rick and Morty, to the British monarchy – here are our top three recommendations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Heights</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>21:40 - M-Net City (DStv 115)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The series explores the lives and relationships of a truly diverse group of residents of a fictional inner-city neighbourhood, and with relatable characters and credible social dynamics, manages to realistically portray Australian life in all its complexities in a way that hasn’t been seen on television in a long time.</p>

        <b>Rick and Morty</b>

      <p>More than two years after the end of season three, fans of the cult-favourite adult animated series will finally be able to join Rick and Morty as the disastrous pair tear through the multiverse along with a host of old friends, including Mr Poopybutthole, Mr Meeseeks and more. This season it’s pretty much the same with crazy and over the top fun, like Rick telling Morty to wait exactly 10 minutes for a salve to fix his skin or else "I’d have to hunt down what you become".</p>

        <b>The Crown</b>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The third season of <i>The Crown</i> sees a new guard sweep into Downing Street, as Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) and her family struggle to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing Britain. From cold-war paranoia, through to the jet-set and the space age - the exuberance of the 1960s and the long hangover of the 1970s - Elizabeth and the Royals must adapt to a new, more liberated, but also a more turbulent world.</p>
