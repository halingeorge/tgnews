      <p>India’s credit crisis has come with a silver lining for some of the country’s funds investing in top-rated corporate bonds.</p>
      <p>Returns have jumped after the central bank delivered a string of rate cuts in part to fight the crisis. The broader credit market woes have also helped indirectly by burnishing the appeal of higher-rated debt, even as lower-rated credits have struggled.</p>

      <p>“The rate-easing cycle is on and liquidity is expected to stay surplus,” said Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer for fixed income at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co.</p>
      <p>Average returns have jumped to the highest in three years on funds holding company notes rated AA+ and above overseen by the top 10 asset management companies.</p>
      <p>The Reserve Bank of India this year has delivered five back-to-back rate cuts. The gains may extend as the RBI is expected to further ease policy amid continued weakness in the economy, fund managers say.</p>
      <p>The spread between a three-year, top-rated company and sovereign debt narrowed 55 basis points so far this year, thanks to Asia’s most aggressive easing cycle. That compares with a widening of 35 basis points in the year-earlier period.</p>
      <p>The risk aversion generated by the collapse of the shadow lending giant IL&amp;FS Group last year has seen assets of funds that invest mainly in AAA or AA rated debt jump to 740 billion rupees ($10.3 billion) in October from 610 billion rupees in April, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India show.</p>
      <p>In comparison, the pool of money managed by funds holding higher-risk debt securities has shrunk by about a fifth to 210 billion rupees during the period, the data show.</p>
