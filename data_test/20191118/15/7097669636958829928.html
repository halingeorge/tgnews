      <p>PARIS (AP) — A 15-year-old girl and a truck driver died Monday when a road bridge collapsed in rural southwest France, dumping several vehicles into a river and prompting nationwide questions about bridge safety.</p>
      <p>Bystanders were able to rescue the girl’s mother after her car fell into the Tarn River near the village of Mirepoix-sur-Tarn, regional prosecutor Dominique Alzeari told reporters.</p>
      <p>Several hours later, Mirepoix-sur-Tarn Mayor Eric Oget said on BFM television that a truck driver whose vehicle fell into the river was also found dead, and rescuers were working to extract his body.</p>
      <p>Five people were injured in the collapse, including two firefighters at the scene, according to the prosecutor.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the cause of the collapse has been opened.</p>
      <p>The bridge had been renovated in 2003 and its last safety check was in 2017. The mayor said it was in good condition, and suggested a truck might have violated the bridge’s weight limit.</p>
      <p>French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, on a visit to Senegal, deplored the “tragic accident.”</p>
