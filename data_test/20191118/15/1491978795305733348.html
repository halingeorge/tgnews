        <i><b>Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff</b><br/>The flamboyant Swedish band fuse rock bombast with pop classicism on their most ambitious tour to date</i>
      </p>
      <p>‘Welcome to tonight’s spectacle,” murmurs the fiendish figure in the spotlight, his latex face rigid as the audience roars. And it is quite a spectacle, replete with pyrotechnics, costume changes, crowd participation and confetti. Swedish metal outfit Ghost have arrived in the big league with a bang.</p>
      <p>The man in the mask is the band’s leader Tobias Forge, taking to the stage here as Cardinal Copia, a sort of satanic Barry Manilow who serves as the latest in a string of creative personas. He’s flanked by a slick band who perform under horned silver helmets and go by the collective sobriquet Nameless Ghouls. It’s all terribly silly, and tremendous fun.</p>
      <p>This tour is Ghost’s most ambitious to date, but they wear the bubbling pre-curtain excitement well. Their recent album, Prequelle, was a Top 10 hit on both sides of the Atlantic and in the years since their emergence as an occult metal oddity with a flamboyant streak, Forge has fine-tuned his writing to combine rock bombast with a winning line in pop classicism.</p>
      <p>Beginning with the thunderous Rats, he plots a course through a set brimming with outlandish camp and pantomime theatre. The music does the heavy lifting to offset some hackneyed stagecraft: if call and response isn’t your thing then the tiered psych-pop harmonies of Mary on a Cross or the monstrous Cirice, 70% doomy riff-fest, 30% Total Eclipse of the Heart, offer more intriguing fare.</p>
      <p>By the time the disco-derived stomp of Dance Macabre has reduced the crowd to a giddy mess of hugs and awkward shape-throwing, Ghost have successfully retrofitted their schlocky origins with a thrilling sense of scope and ambition. The closer, Square Hammer, is fitting. It keeps Forge’s obsession with melody close to its heart, but it’s also the sort of head-banging imperative that satisfies the old guard.</p>
      <p>Ghost’s arena show is loud, self-aware and studded with outstanding songs. Pop and metal have long found common ground in a shared love of over-the-top pageantry, and there are few better at delivering that than Forge and his anonymous crew. “Are you with us?” he yells. The answer from the floor is a resounding yes.</p>
      <p>• <a href="http://ghost-official.com/#tour">Touring the UK</a> until 23 November.</p>
