      <h1>Arsenal midfielder’s agent comments on potential exit – Position under Emery an issue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:46:58+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Earlier on Monday when covering claims from TMW that Lucas Torreira is increasingly convinced his future is best served by leaving Arsenal, we explained that it’s worth taking notice of what is reported in Italy about the player… because his agent has a history of speaking to the media there.</p>
      <p>Right on cue, Pablo Bentancur has obliged and had a brief chat with <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/bentancur-a-cm-milan-torreira-ecco-perche-non-e-andata-in-porto--25745">Calciomercato</a>.</p>
      <p>Asked why he believes the player has lost his place under Unai Emery, the agent appeared to confirm rumours Torreira isn’t happy with the manager changing his position: <i>“I must say that the change of role has penalised him sharply. He is no longer at ease and we hope that things can change.”</i></p>
      <p>Calciomercato then asked if an exit is possible next summer if the situation at Arsenal remains the same.</p>
      <p>Bentancur made sure to show appreciation to those in charge at the London club, but didn’t rule out a move: <i>“We have no problem with Arsenal but only words of thanks. Arsenal has allowed Lucas to compete in the Premier League, he has always been shown great confidence. Clearly there’s interest for Torreira, especially from Spanish clubs, but I have never sat down with any club to talk about his transfer. This is because of the great respect we have for the Gunners and their general manager Raul Sanllhei.”</i></p>
      <p>When further pressed on whether one of the Spanish clubs is Atletico Madrid, the agent said: <i>“I don’t want to name the teams out of respect, but I can tell you that Atletico had tried to take Lucas from Sampdoria two years ago.”</i></p>
      <p>And when asked if it’s true the Uruguayan nearly moved to AC Milan during the summer window, he explained: <i>“There was an interest as well as other clubs. But we got together with the Gunners general manager, Raul Sanllhei, and he immediately told us that for Arsenal, Torreira was not for sale, an adamant position. I also have to say that Milan did not present a real concrete offer, perhaps because they knew what Arsenal thought.”</i></p>
      <p>Bentancur didn’t rule out a return to Italy, where the midfielder had success before moving to England, and it’s clear there’s a desire to get Torreira’s unease out into the media.</p>
      <p>This situation could be a growing problem for Emery.</p>
