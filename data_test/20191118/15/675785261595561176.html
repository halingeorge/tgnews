      <h1>Unite's Len McCluskey mocks Boris Johnson as 'Eton's answer to Del Boy'</h1>
      <h2>The Unite General Secretary compared the Tory Prime Minister to the Only Fools and Horses hero. He attacked Mr Johnson's privileged upbringing and education</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:16:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>A senior union leader has described Boris Johnson as "Eton's answer to Del Boy".</p>
      <p>Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said the Prime Minister's "privileged upbringing" had given him an "arrogant sense of entitlement to rule".</p>
      <p>Mr McCluskey, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, said austerity will never be over as long as the Tories are in power, adding: "The damage and destruction they have imposed on our communities has been absolutely devastating.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately this election is about trust. Who do we trust to charter our communities out of the troubled waters, to a better future?</p>
      <p>"Is it <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> , a man whose privileged upbringing has given him such an arrogant sense of entitlement to rule, and would appear to be prepared to stop at nothing to keep the keys to Number 10. Eton's answer to Del Boy.</p>
      <p>"Or is it <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> , the only leader able and determined to speak for our whole nation, on Brexit as on other issues."</p>

      <p>He told a Unite conference in Brighton: "We're in the fight of our lives to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to elect a government that gives working people hope, that will give our industries a fighting future.</p>
      <p>"We need to stop a no-deal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , which only a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> government is pledged to do.  </p>
      <p>"Labour is the only party trying to bring the country together on Brexit. Not just half of it, while dismissing the other half, as the Tories and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> are doing.  </p>
      <p>"Our big task now is to ensure that the Labour vote holds. In striving to do that, never has the need been greater to take the debate beyond Brexit, to start dealing with the issues that affect the lives of ordinary people every day."</p>
