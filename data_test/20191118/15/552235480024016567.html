      <h1>Health bosses: "No-one will be turned away from Vale Hospital GP service"</h1>
      <h2>But NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde say patients will be "redirected" if it's closed.</h2>

      <p>Health chiefs have reassured patients that no-one will be turned away from getting urgent access to a GP at the Vale of Leven Hospital amid claims a mum was told to take her child to a unit in Glasgow instead recently.</p>
      <p>Jackie Baillie MSP also says she has been contacted by constituents left frustrated after showing up at the unit only to find out it is closed.</p>
      <p>However health chiefs have reassured that, if patients contact NHS24 ahead of attending at the out-of-hours service, they will be directed to the nearest available facility and they will not be turned away.</p>

      <p>Jackie Baillie MSP has expressed her worries that the service could hit crisis point soon with plummeting temperatures.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s getting worse. I have had people contacting me saying they are being sent to Gartnavel and to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley because out-of-hours at the Vale isn’t open.</p>
      <p>“They will end up at the front door of A&amp;E which is already struggling.</p>
      <p>“This will be a hard winter and people should not have to travel to access a service such as this.</p>
      <p>“Out-of-hours is a service where people need to be seen locally and want to be seen locally. The health board need to recognise this.”</p>
      <p>Hospitalwatch chair Jim Moohan remains optimistic that the situation will improve but said that there had been some issues recently including a situation where a mum showed up at the Vale with her child but, due to the GP out-of-hours unit being closed, were sent to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital instead.</p>
      <p>Doctors locally are understood to be in the process of taking over the running of rotas at the GP out-of-hours service but this is yet to be finalised with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde saying “the exact format of this has not yet been agreed and work is still progressing”.</p>
      <p>The unit, which gives patients access to a doctor urgently outwith normal health centre opening times, has been plagued by problems for several years with closures at short notice due to staffing difficulties.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Speaking about the most recent closures, a spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “Every patient across NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) who requires GP out-of-hours care needs to contact NHS 24 in the first instance.</p>
      <p>“Access to the GP out-of-hours service via NHS 24 will ensure patients receive safe and high quality patient care by the right service at the right time. If patients call, they will be directed to their nearest out-of-hours service which is open at that time.</p>
      <p>“No patients are turned away but if they turn up without having called NHS24 first and the out-of-hours centre is closed, they are redirected to the nearest centre which is open.</p>
      <p>“The majority of shifts at all our GP out-of-hours centres are filled but when we don’t fill all our shifts we need to allocate staff to ensure adequate geographical cover is provided and that demand is met.”</p>
      <p>When the Vale of Leven unit is closed, people are redirected to either the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley or to the nearest site in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>During closures, a GP home visiting service is available as normal for patients assessed by NHS24 as requiring this and patient transport is also made available to those without their own means of getting to another hospital.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The spokeswoman stressed that closures at short notice due to staffing problems are not unique to the Vale of Leven Hospital and that work is currently ongoing to try and improve the “front door” services.</p>
      <p>She said: “We recently hosted a workshop to look at a redesign of the ‘front door’ services, including what further work could be done to help provide a more sustainable out-of-hours service at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to work with local clinicians and stakeholders to develop these proposals.”</p>
