      <p>Michelle Visage <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-michelle-visage-voted-out-in-week-9/">was eliminated</a> from <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> this weekend, and viewers were left perplexed as to why her "best bits" were shown on the Sunday night show.</p>
      <p>Michelle was the eight celebrity to leave the BBC show and it's the first time the best bits have been aired during the results show.</p>

      <p>There were, however, some fan theories as to why Michelle's best bits were shown on the main show.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Some said it was probably because bosses knew "she was a finalist".</p>
      <aside>Why did they show Michelle’s best bits like that? Also they had a prerecorded goodbye. That was weird wasn’t it?</aside>
      <p>While some said it was to "make up" for the fact she posed rather than danced on Saturday night.</p>

      <p>Others thought there was a more sinister reason, and said there was "something fishy" going on.</p>
