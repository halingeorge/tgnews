      <p>The 66-year-old television personality took to Instagram Sunday after Cassidy Gifford, 26, got engaged to her boyfriend, Ben Wierda.</p>

      <p>"So thrilled to announce that my beautiful daughter, @cassidygiff is engaged to a wonderful man, Ben @letsgetwierda," she captioned the post. "I am beyond the moon and stars. Thank you, LORD!"</p>
      <p>Gifford's former<i> Today </i>co-host Hoda Kotb, <i>Today </i>contributor Joy Bauer and television personality <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kris-Jenner/?tps=1">Kris Jenner</a> were among those to congratulate Cassidy Gifford and Wierda in the comments.</p>
