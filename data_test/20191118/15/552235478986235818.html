      <p>P7 children at Springholm enjoyed a Hallowe’en party at the school.</p>
      <p>They played corners, musical statues, dooking for apples, decorating biscuits, pin the nose on the pumpkin, pin the wart on the witch and music.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They are also currently enjoying an eight week block of coaching from Queen of the South FC.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">And the primary seven class took part in curling lessons at Dumfries Ice Bowl at that start of the month.</a>
