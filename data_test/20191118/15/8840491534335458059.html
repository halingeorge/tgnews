      <p>MAYO GAA County Board has informed Mayo sports journalist Michael Gallagher that his nomination for the role as public relations officer has not been accepted due to a technicality.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gallagher was told he was not a member of Ballycroy GAA Club, the club which nominated him, on March 31 in line with the organisation's guidelines.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued to <i>The Connaught Telegraph</i>, Mr. Gallagher said his challenge for the position is not over yet.</p>
      <p>He said: “They (county board) rang me last night (Sunday) saying I was disqualified because I wasn't a member of Ballycroy GAA on March 31.</p>
      <p>“I thanked them for getting in touch.</p>
      <p>"They asked me to withdraw. I refused and told them to disqualify me. They did so.</p>
      <p>“We're taking it to another forum in the coming week.”</p>
