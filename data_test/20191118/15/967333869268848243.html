      <p>As reporters sought to obtain the prime minister’s opinion on the matter, he simply told them that he has no intention to get "dragged" into this issue, refusing to give any further comment.</p>
      <blockquote>"I won't get dragged into commentary about matters concerning the royal family," Johnson stated.</blockquote>
      <p>Last week, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, sat down with the BBC’s Emily Maitlis to discuss his ties with Epstein and allegations of child sexual abuse.</p>
