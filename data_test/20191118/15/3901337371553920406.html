      <p>With the domestic season quickly approaching the halfway mark, Soccer Laduma takes a look at six of the many players who could end 2019 without a club. </p>
      <p>George Lebese who parted ways with Mamelodi Sundowns during the final hours of the July/August transfer window this year, is still a free agent and according to Siya sources, there is yet to be a club to show official interest in the player. </p>

      </p>
      <p>As previously revealed by the Siya crew, Lebese’s camp was also looking for options overseas, although it could be possible that he will still be a free agent by the end of the year.  </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Bhongolethu Jayiya, who was previously on the books of Kaizer Chiefs, received his clearance from Amakhosi in May this year; however, the player is still unattached and could possibly end the year as a free agent.</p>
      <p>Siphiwe Tshabalala is another player who is still unattached after returning home from a season-long stint in Turkey. While the player has been linked with a return abroad, nothing has materialized as yet. </p>
      <p>Former Orlando Pirates defender, Patrick Phungwayo is still a free agent after parting ways with Free State Stars in July this year. </p>
      <p>Former Mamelodi Sundowns centre-back, Thabo Nthethe is also on the list of free agents, with the 35-year-old unattached to a club since leaving Chippa United in January this year. </p>
      <p>Another defender, who is still a free agent since July 01, is Brian Onyango, despite the player having recently undergone a training stint with Pirates. </p>
