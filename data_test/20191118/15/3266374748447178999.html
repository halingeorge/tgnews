      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:23:12+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/atrayobh7/" target="_blank">Atrayo Bhattacharya</a></address>
      <h3>The Premier League champions are weighing up a January move for Arsenal target, Dayot Upamecano.</h3>
      <p>According to the exclusive report on <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6498787-exclusive-man-city-consider-january-bid-for-rb-leipzig-defender-dayot-upamecano">90 min</a>, Premier League champions are eyeing a move for RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano in January to add more depth to their injury-plagued backline.</p>
      <p>With their former captain Vincent Kompany’s departure, they were already a player short in that department and injuries have not been kind with Pep Guardiola’s men as they looked shoddy at the back especially with Aymeric Laporte sidelined. Even John Stones suffered a knock early in the season and missed a few games, leaving the Spaniard with only Nicolas Otamendi in central defence.</p>
      <p>Manchester City’s defence this season have not been the best so far and therefore Guardiola has reportedly decided to bring in reinforcements in that position, allowing him more options going into the business of the season. According to reports Dayot Upamecano has caught their sight.</p>

      <p>The 21-year old centre back is one of the most highly-rated young defenders around and was also linked with a move to Arsenal this summer. While there are multiple other clubs also monitoring him, City are ought to win the race for his signature mainly if they decide to splash the cash in January.</p>
      <p>Earlier Pep Guardiola decided that he won’t make any January signings as he wants to avoid panic buys. However, looking at the condition of the Citizens and the lack of depth in defence forces him to change his mind and therefore he wants someone who can be at the Etihad for a lengthy span of time and also suits his playing style.</p>
      <p>So after looking at a lot of talented defenders, it is reported that the scouts have shortlisted Dayot Upamecano and Benfica’s Ruben Dias as the most suitable options. Both of them are highly rated and are immensely talented and also would be available in January for the perfect price tag. Both defenders are also technically sound and can easily step in, making an immediate impact in the Manchester City squad.</p>

      <p>Ruben Dias is contracted with Benfica till 2024 while Upamecano will enter the last 18 months of his contract with Leipzig this January. Therefore the Citizens are more inclined in signing the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Upamecano has been an integral part of Julian Nagelsmann’s RB Leipzig and it would cost City around £50m to lure the 21-year old Frenchman, which is a fair deal considering the whole scenario and the talent the defender possesses.</p>
      <p>Upamecano started his career at Valenciennes youth team and then moved out to RB Salzburg winning the Austrian Bundesliga twice he jumped ship to join RB Leipzig and ever since then he has only been with every game. The 21-year old has also represented France in various age groups and looks like a future prospect.</p>
      <p>Upamecano is very capable of playing the ball out from the back and his big physical stature makes him an aerial threat. The 21-year old is matured with his approach and his inspiring performances has catapulted Nagelsmann’s side to the second position in Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>So it will be interesting so whether Pep Guardiola will get his favoured transfer target in January or not and how things will change at Leipzig with this news.</p>
