      <p>India's capital, <b>New Delhi</b>, has the world's most polluted air, according to an air quality monitoring agency.</p>
      <p>Two other Indian cities, Kolkata and Mumbai, also ranked among the top 10 cities with the <b>dirtiest air</b>, on the sixth and ninth position respectively, Swiss-based <b>IQ AirVisual</b> said on Friday.</p>
      <p>"For nine consecutive days from Sunday, October 27, 2019, overall Delhi air quality was in the hazardous zone, a level at which the entire population is likely to be affected,‚Äù said an <b>IQ AirVisual</b> statement.</p>
      <p><b>New Delhi</b>'s schools were closed on Thursday and Friday as the city's poor air quality reached dangerously high levels.</p>
      <p><b>Pollution</b> in <b>New Delhi</b> peaked after the Indian festival was celebrated on October 28th. A state of emergency in the Indian capital was declared last month after a total <b>air quality index</b> (AQI) figure close to 459 was reached.</p>
      <p>AQI between 401 500 is considered severe. Figures over 500 are considered very severe and urgent <b>pollution</b> control measures are required.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court of India has made scathing comments over the government's inaction over pollution.</p>
      <p>The EPCA, mandated by the highest court, said air quality was extremely poor in <b>New Delhi</b> and its region. Therefore, all types of construction work were prohibited.</p>
