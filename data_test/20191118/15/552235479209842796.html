      <p>A group of young Dumbarton FC supporters have shot to fame after starring on BBC Scotland’s A View from the Terrace.</p>
      <p>The Young Sons of the Rock featured on last week’s edition of the cult football show, and proved so popular online that their story was shared with an audience of over 4.5 million on Match of the Day’s Facebook page.</p>
      <p>A View from the Terrace series director Jordan Laird told the Lennox Herald why they decided to feature the growing group of Sons fans which was started by Jack Rolmanis, Lewis Thackray and Lennon Smillie.</p>
      <p>He said: “It started from a question. We were talking about who was responsible for creating an atmosphere at a football ground; fans or the team.</p>
      <p>“I always got annoyed at fans being pessimistic, one of our researchers stumbled across the Dumbarton Ultras and they seemed like proper supporters who really got behind their team.</p>
      <p>“We got in touch with the club who were really helpful and they put us in touch with the guys who were a breath of fresh air.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“They genuinely couldn’t understand why you would moan at the players, they really couldn’t get their heads around the fact that people would choose to be negative – they were asking why a player would want to score for us if they’re just being moaned at.</p>
      <p>“That reminded me how cynical we can be as adults.”</p>
      <p>One of the stars of the video was OLSP pupil Max Ryan, 12, and he told the Lennox Herald that it was the Young Sons who got him interested in supporting his local team.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was never really much of a Dumbarton fan, I had never been interested in the club until now.</p>
      <p>“At first I thought I wasn’t too sure about it, but I thought I’d try it out and now I really like being involved.</p>
      <p>“The BBC coming encouraged a few more people to come along, because there were definitely a few new faces at the East Fife game.</p>
      <p>“After it went out you walk through school and teachers are now coming up to you saying they saw you on TV and things like that - it’s quite funny.”</p>
      <p>And Max now hopes that the group can use their new found fame to help those in the local area.</p>
      <p>He added: “We have been thinking about trying to help things like the foodbank throughout the local community now, it would be great to get involved with something like that.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The show’s presenter Craig Telfer was full of praise for the impact the Young Sons made.</p>
      <p>He said: “The VT with the Dumbarton Ultras has been my favourite VT in the whole series – I think that says a lot given some of the features we’ve included in the past.</p>
      <p>“It perfectly encapsulates what we’re trying to do with the show – showcase Scottish football culture and explore what the game means to supporters across the country, they come across very well and are a credit to the club.”</p>
