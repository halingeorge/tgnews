      <p>Nearing the end of November means one thing and one thing only - <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> savings. Some will tell you it means that Christmas is nearing, time with their family and a big turkey dinner but those people likely didn't see a recent offer from EE.</p>
      <p>The crux of the phone deal is this - buy a Huawei P Smart straight from EE and it will go ahead and throw in a free <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a>. Not a big gamer? Not a problem, EE will pull a switcheroo and give you a free 4K Toshiba 43-inch TV instead.</p>
      <p>So far so good, right? A 2019 Huawei device and a premium freebie? You would assume the catch would come in the cost. And yet, this whole bundle comes to a total of £28 a month and just £20 upfront - EE will even throw in 10GB of data each month!</p>
      <p>We've listed everything you'll need to know about this offer below.

      <h4>What's good about the Huawei P Smart?</h4>
      <p>While it doesn't have the name recognition that its bigger (and more powerful) brothers, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/deals/huawei-p30-deals">Huawei P30</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/deals/huawei-p30-deals/uk/deals/huawei-p30-pro-deals">P30 Pro</a> have, the P Smart is still rocking some impressive specs for its price.</p>
      <p>It has a stylish design, with a tear-drop notch giving the screen a fluid almost infinity look. It's packed with ample amounts of storage, a 3400mAh battery and a pretty respectful level of processing power.<br/><br/>It even has a Full HD 6.21-inch screen, meaning you'll still be seeing some brightness and clear vision when watching, scrolling and generally making use of the handset.</p>
