      <h3>Spencer also side-stepped rumours of multiple next-gen Xboxes.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/phil-spencer/">Xbox head Phil Spencer</a> said he won’t “sacrifice performance for the sake of price” when it comes to holiday 2020’s Project Scarlett.</p>
      <p>“If you remember at the launch of Xbox One, we were $100 more expensive and less powerful,” he said in conversation with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-15-the-big-xo19-interview-xbox-boss-phil-spencer">Eurogamer</a> at X019. “So, I won’t be in that position. There’s no doubt about that. As an industry that’s growing so fast, we do think about price. We do think about performance as well. I’m not going to sacrifice performance for the sake of price.”</p>
      <p>Spencer side-stepped the question of whether or not we’ll see <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/rumours/xbox-anaconda-lockhart-expected-2020/">multiple next-gen Xboxes as per rumours of ones codenamed Anaconda and Lockhart</a>. Said rumours suggested we’ll see lower- and higher-tiered Xbox consoles as per the current-gen Xbox One S and Xbox One X.</p>
      <p>“I won’t remove options from the future,” he conceeded. “I will say, from the launch of Xbox One, I’ve definitely learned that being too expensive and not powerful enough is not a great place to be. And price and performance are gonna be important, and we’re very focused on both of those things.”</p>
      <p>Stay tuned to Stevivor for more from <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/phil-spencer/">Phil Spencer</a>; we sat down in a one-to-one conversation as part of X019 in London last weekend.</p>
