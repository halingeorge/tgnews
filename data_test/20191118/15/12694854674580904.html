      <h1>The new Motorola Razr is very expensive − but it could be even pricier in Europe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:38:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author">Aatif Sulleyman</a></address>

        <b>At the time of publication, Motorola has officially only revealed how much the new Razr will cost in the US. The magic number is $1499, which translates to approximately €1350. If you thought <i>that</i> was staggeringly pricey, you may want to brace yourself for what comes next.</b>

      <p>A new report has claimed that consumers based in Europe will have to fork out − get ready − €1680 for the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/motorola-razr-2019-price-release-date-specs-3646133">Motorola Razr 2019</a>. That’s the equivalent of $1860 − which would represent a significant step up in price.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The new figure comes from Dutch site <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/opvouwbare-telefoons/motorola-razr-kopen-prijs/">LetsGoDigital</a>, which reports that that €1680 figure is how much the Razr will cost in Sweden. However, the same publication writes that the Razr’s recommended retail price might differ from European market to European market.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that US-based customers will pay VAT after the fact, but even when you take that into account there’s a noticeable pricing difference.</p>
      <p>Motorola would be far from the first example of a company to flog its goods at much steeper price points in the UK than the US.</p>
      <p>In September, for instance, <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-takes-uk-customers-cleaners-new-iphone-pricing-3937680">Apple raised eyebrows</a> when it revealed that the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-11">iPhone 11</a> would start at £729 (~$945) in the UK and $699 (~£540) in the US. It was a similar story for the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-11-pro">iPhone 11 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-11-pro-max">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>.</p>
      <p>Whichever way you look at it though, the new Razr isn’t intended to be a mass-market device. Beautiful and nostalgia-inducing as its design is, there’s some underwhelming hardware beneath that attractive hood.</p>

      <p>The Snapdragon 710, for instance, is a mid-range processor that also features on the Xiaomi Mi 8 SE, which is a pared down version of the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-8">Xiaomi Mi 8</a>.</p>
      <p>We’re also far from optimistic about how much battery life you’ll be able to get out of the 2510mAh cell − especially when you consider that it has to power not just one but two screens.</p>
