      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:30:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Ed Woodward says Manchester United have a ‘clear vision’ for recruitment – and hinted the club are ready to spend amid reports linking them with Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn.</p>
      <p>United were first credited with an interest in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">McGinn</a> in the summer transfer window after the Scotland international played a key role in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa’s</a> promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old signed a new five-year deal at Villa Park ahead of the first game of the season but <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-transfer-news-grealish-17267345">it is understood United have continued to monitor his performances.</a></p>
      <p>Old Trafford executive vice-chairman Woodward addressed the New York Stock Exchange to inform shareholders of results from the first quarter of the financial year.</p>

      <p>And recruitment to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad was high on the agenda after a difficult start to the season.</p>
      <p>Woodward <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ed-woodward-outlines-man-utds-20907005">said:</a> “We have a clear vision in terms of football philosophy and recruitment.</p>
      <p>"The significant investments that we have made in recent years in areas such as transfers, recruitment infrastructure, analytics and academy are already beginning to bear fruit.</p>
      <p>"We are very proud to be approaching our 4,000th game featuring an academy player and we are particularly optimistic regarding considerable young talent coming through.</p>
      <p>"The ultimate goal is win trophies playing exciting football with a team that fuses academy graduates and world-class acquisitions.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McGinn has proved to be one of Villa's best bargain signings in recent years having excelled since joining from Scottish Premiership side Hibernian for under £3m last year.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-transfer-news-grealish-17267345">McGinn and team-mate Jack Grealish are on a transfer hit-list alongside six other players</a> United are looking at in a bid to beef up their squad in January.</p>
