      <p>Before he was forced to live under the stairs of his Aunt and Uncle’s home or whisked away to Hogwarts, Harry Potter lived in <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow">Godric’s Hollow</a> – and the real-life version of his childhood home is available to rent as an <a href="https://thespaces.com/tag/airbnb">Airbnb</a> in England. The Tudor-style B&amp;B is in the medieval town of Lavenham in the West Country, known for its heritage-listed structures.</p>

      <p>De Vere House – as the Grade-I listed 14th-century countryside property is called – is one of the most photographed houses in the UK and is a mecca for Potter-fans. It includes a reception hall, drawing room, dining room and three double bedrooms. Guests can check-in to its guest wing <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/35058633?source_impression_id=p3_1572556810_9xSrGINVrbwk8rOA&amp;irgwc=1&amp;irclid=WHz03n0EmxyOTv1wUx0Mo38WUkn1uZz53xI9280&amp;ircid=4273&amp;sharedid=thrillist.com&amp;af=49497874&amp;iratid=9627&amp;c=.pi73.pk4273_10078&amp;irparam1=&amp;display_currency=GBP">from £120 per night</a>, which houses two en-suite bedroom suites with four-poster beds. The wing has its own private entrance and a full breakfast served in the dining room, is included in the price.</p>

      <p>Those expecting a plethora of Harry Potter paraphernalia will be disappointed, however, as the house is outfitted in a traditional style. But perhaps that’s a more authentic experience for devotees of the films and books.</p>
