      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jessie-j/">Jessie J</a> just posted a *fire emoji, fire emoji, fire emoji* pic to her Instagram story wearing nothing but Calvin Klein underwear and she looks incredible.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old singer took to Instagram to share the photo to her 8.7 million followers with the caption: ‘Not an ad! But I am #InMyCalvins’.</p>
      <p>It shows the Bang Bang singer topless but wearing high-waisted Calvin Klein underwear, as she took a selfie in the mirror.</p>
      <p>The strategic placement of the camera in front of the mirror shows off both the front and back… and she looks all kinds of fire.</p>

      <p>But just 15 hours later, Jessie shared a story about her anxiety, featuring plain white text against a black background.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘My anxiety is so bad today,’ she wrote. ‘Like the worst it’s been in ages.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘Not judging myself. Not trying to over react. Just being as calm as I can. Being gentle with myself. Protecting my energy and space.</p>
      <p>‘Wanted to share for anyone else feeling the same way. You are not alone.</p>
      <p>‘Give yourself some time. Try and find some quiet space and breathe.’</p>

      <p>She also shared a simple graphic with the message: ‘Check up on your people. Seeing them on social media is not enough.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/10/jessie-j-not-anybody-mocking-misspelled-tattoo-small-boobs-9481075/">Jessie J blasted critics who judged her for getting a tattoo</a> with a spelling mistake in it.</p>
      <p>She posted a photo of her in bikini with the caption: ‘Yes my tattoo says… “don’t loose who you are in the blur of the stars”. Yes they are MY lyrics from my song who you are. Yes that I wrote. Yes I spelt the tattoo wrong. Yes I repeat it’s spelt wrong.</p>
      <p>‘Yes I got it done in Essex. Yes the tattoo artist didn’t mention it. Yes I was 18. Yes I still don’t know the difference between lose and loose. Yes It’s the reason I wear everything high waisted [sic].’</p>

      <p>Jessie – who went on to feature the phrase she got inked on her skin in 2011’s Who You Are – then decided to school the haters even further, by shutting down comments about her bra size.</p>
      <p>She wrote: ‘And YES I know I have small boobs. Don’t waste your time telling me like I don’t see them everyday. Don’t @ me K bye.’</p>
      <p>You go, girl.</p>
