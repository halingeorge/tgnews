      <h1>Care home 'needs deep clean and has bad smells', says damning report</h1>
      <h2>There was 'unexplained bruising' on one resident and 'heavy staining' in the bathroom</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:34:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author">Conor Gogarty</a></address>
      <p>Inspectors have found a family-run Brislington care home needs a “deep clean” and ordered it to address bad smells.</p>
      <p>The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has published a report which rates Robleaze House, on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/brislington">Bath Road</a>, ‘requires improvement’ following a September inspection.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/health/">watchdog</a> was concerned by “unexplained bruising” on one resident, as well as missing plaster in a bedroom, “heavy staining” in the bathroom and “malodours” in parts of the home.</p>
      <p>It also revealed the inspection was prompted by a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-constabulary">police</a> investigation into a safeguarding incident.</p>
      <p>“This was not substantiated but we needed to be assured people were safe,” the report reads.</p>
      <p>The CQC found Robleaze to be in breach of six regulations, rating it ‘requires improvement’ in its safety, effectiveness, responsiveness and leadership, despite a ‘good’ level of caring.</p>
      <h3>Incidents not reported</h3>

      <p>Robleaze, which previously had an overall ‘good’ rating, cares for 10 people with a learning disability, four of whom have lived there since it opened 26 years ago.</p>
      <p>The report says: “During the inspection we saw there had been two incidents in August 2019 where a person had kicked two other people in the home.</p>
      <p>“Whilst these did not result in serious injury, these had not been reported to Bristol City Council's safeguarding team or to the Care Quality Commission.</p>
      <p>“They have a legal responsibility to report these to the Care Quality Commission and the local authority's safeguarding team.</p>
      <p>“There has also been some unexplained bruising to one person these had not been reported to safeguarding.”</p>
      <h3>'Not properly maintained'</h3>

      <p>The inspectors said parts of the home required a “deep clean” and also highlighted missing tiles in the “dated” shower room.</p>
      <p>“Another bathroom had heavy staining on the floor, the grout and sealant needed to be replaced around the bath,” they added.</p>
      <p>“There were cleaning schedules in place, but these had not been completed for the month of September 2019.</p>
      <p>“One bedroom had a water mark on the roof. We were told this had occurred 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>“This had been noted at the last inspection in April 2018. The premises were not properly maintained.”</p>
      <p>The CQC deemed people in the home to be at risk from a resident who was “known to tip furniture”.</p>
      <p>Despite this, there was no mention in this person's care plan about how staff should support them.</p>
      <h3>'No temperature checks'</h3>
      <p>“There were no temperature checks completed to ensure medication was stored at the correct temperature and safe for use," the report continues.</p>
      <p>“One person had a medical condition which meant they needed supervision when bathing.</p>
      <p>“Recommendations had been made by health and social care professionals, but these had not been incorporated into the care plan to keep them safe."</p>
      <p>The inspectors also found there was no formal process to record staff inductions or show competence in giving medicine.</p>
      <p>Four staff members had received no formal supervision in the previous 10 months.</p>
      <p>The report also says: “People and their relatives spoke positively about the care and support provided by the staff and the registered manager.”</p>
      <p>Robleaze has been approached for comment.</p>
