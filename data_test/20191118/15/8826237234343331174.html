      <h1>Ruth Bader Ginsburg Is Back on the Bench After Missing Supreme Court Arguments for Stomach Bug</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:51:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>(WASHINGTON) â€” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is back on the Supreme Court bench after missing time last week with what the court described as a stomach bug.</p>
      <p>The 86-year-old Ginsburg climbed the three steps and took her seat for a brief court session Monday. She was absent when the justices last met in public, to hear arguments on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has been treated for cancer twice in the past year, including receiving radiation for a tumor on her pancreas over the summer. She missed court sessions in January during her recovery from lung cancer surgery.</p>
      <p>Those were her first absences from court arguments in a quarter-century as a justice.</p>
