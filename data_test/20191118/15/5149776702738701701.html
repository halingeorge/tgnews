      <h1>Championship's newest manager recalls joining Nottingham Forest and then quickly regretting the move</h1>
      <h2>The ex-Forest striker has taken over the reigns at Cardiff City following Neil Warnock's departure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Neil Harris admits his decision to join <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> in 2004 was a mistake.</p>
      <p>Harris, who has just been appointed as the successor to Neil Warnock at Cardiff City, moved to Forest after cutting short a loan spell with the Bluebirds.</p>
      <p>That move didn’t go down too well in south Wales, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/nottingham-forest-20-worst-signings-1236456">nor did it live long in the memory on the banks of the Trent</a>, and almost 16 years on from that transfer to the City Ground, he says it was one he regrets.</p>
      <p>"I made a mistake not staying here longer," Harris said, having spent three years at Forest, playing a little over 30 times.</p>
      <p>"I mean that in total respect to Nottingham Forest, but at the time I made a family decision for various reasons.</p>
      <p>"It's probably one of the only things <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-real-disappointment-strikers-3490186">I've really regretted</a> in my footballing career so far.</p>

      <p>"But I'm certainly proud and privileged to be sitting here. I have to win people over and I am prepared to do that."</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old departed Millwall last month, before being confirmed as boss at the Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>He’ll bring his new team to Nottingham to face Sabri Lamouchi’s Forest on November 30, and says he won’t look to become another version of Warnock.</p>
      <p>"I think people are referring to the club I was at previously and the way we played," said Harris, who revealed <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/notts-county-legend-neil-warnock-3527095">Warnock</a> had sent him a text congratulating him on his appointment.</p>

      <p>"I was at Millwall who demand getting the ball forward quickly and have physical attributes to the game. Some of those principles I will stick to, but I want to adjust because of how I am as a coach.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there is a Neil Warnock Mark II. He's his own man and I'm respectful towards that.</p>
      <p>"I also have to be respectful of the players I've got and we can't change overnight.</p>
      <p>"There has to be a process to that and it takes time. It is not going to be revolution overnight."</p>
