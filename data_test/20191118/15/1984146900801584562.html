      <h1>Hatem Ben Arfa in but Nolan misses out - fans pick THEIR Newcastle team of the decade</h1>
      <h2>As part of our End of the Decade series, we're asking fans to pick their team of the decade and it's very different to our side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:20:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Douglas</a></address>
      <p>On Monday we kicked off our End of Decade series with Football Publishing Editor Mark Douglas donning the tin hat to pick his best XI of the 2010s.</p>
      <p>As many pointed out on social media, it has been an underwhelming decade for the most part: one relegation and far too many brushes with trouble jostle with that one season where the club pushed for the top four.</p>
      <p>But despite the tumult, there have been some very good players to don the black and white in that time. Here’s who the readers opted for.</p>
      <h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
      <p><b>Tim Krul</b> got the nod in between the sticks, beating competition from Martin Dubravka and Karl Darlow, who was Newcastle’s custodian for most of the Championship season. Long-serving Krul left while Rafa Benitez was manager and his only real competitor here was current stopper Dubravka, who got plenty of votes.</p>
      <h3>Defence</h3>
      <p>Readers agreed on <b>Fabricio Coloccini</b> , whose contribution spanned a good chunk of the decade. He’s the only player in black and white to make it into a PFA team of the year during a decade in which Newcastle mainly flattered to deceive. He has been partnered by <b>Fabian Schar</b> in the readers team: proof that the Switzerland international has made some impact.</p>

      <p>As we head towards the year 2020, we've launched a week-long End of Decade series to mark the conclusion of a turbulent 10 years in the history of Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>Here's all the features we've run so far:</p>

      <p>At left-back <b>Jose Enrique</b> got the nod over Paul Dummett while Newcastle fans have chosen to forgive Daryl Janmaat for his final few months, handing the right-back the starting slot.</p>

      <h3>Midfield</h3>
      <p>Our readers could pick any formation they wanted but opted for a 4-4-2 with <b>Yohan Cabaye</b> predictably taking up the playmaker slot. <b>Cheick Tiote</b> , who served as a midfield disrupter with distinction, got the nod alongside him.</p>
      <p>Kevin Nolan, who was a superb captain in the 2010/11 season, misses out.</p>
      <p>Perhaps our most contentious call was not picking <b>Hatem Ben Arfa</b> , whose alchemy was intoxicating while he played in black and white. I didn’t think he did enough over a long enough period to get in the side but readers clearly disagreed, handing him the right-sided midfield slot.</p>
      <p><b>Jonas Gutierrez</b> , whose heroic battle back from testicular cancer to the Premier League, got the nod on the left.</p>

      <h3>Strikers</h3>
      <p>They never really gelled as a pair but individually they contribued much. Readers felt <b>Papiss Cisse</b> deserved to partner <b>Demba Ba</b> , whose brief spell as a Newcastle forward coincided with the period where they were at their most dangerous.</p>
      <p>Ba was an obvious pick but Cisse split opinion. He still makes it in here.</p>
