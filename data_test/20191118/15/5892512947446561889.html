      <p>Heavyweight championship? Six-figure payday?</p>
      <p>Nah, Anthony Johnson just wants to hurt people, which is why he’s contemplating a summer 2020 return to mixed martial arts (MMA), the sport for athletes who love to inflict pain, but don’t feel like spending their holidays in the slammer.</p>
      <p>How do you think we <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/6/12/17453272/greg-hardy-domestic-violence-ufc-debut-tuesday-night-contender-series-dana-white-angel-cowboys-mma">ended up with Greg Hardy?</a></p>
      <p>Like the “Prince of War,” Johnson (22-6) <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2010/8/12/1619314/ufc-welterweight-anthony-johnson">also has a dubious past</a> when it comes to violence against women (<a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2015/8/19/9175237/ufc-anthony-johnson-ugly-misogynistic-facebook-rant-ugly-girl-blackzilians">watch your yoga mat around this guy</a>) but doesn’t get nearly as much heat as the former Gridiron great because the promotion has <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2014/1/31/5363454/dana-white-still-likes-anthony-johnson-open-rumble-ufc-return-wsof-mma">big brooms and heavy carpets</a>.</p>
      <p>“We have to meet with the UFC some more,” Johnson told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpuQeyL7W_I">The Mac Life</a> about his ongoing negotiations. “We have to go over things and just figure some stuff out but it’s all looking good so far. I was trying to shoot for April-May but maybe June-July. We’ll see. But whenever I come back I’m going to make sure it’s known. I want to come back and showcase everything and fight and just hurt people.”</p>
      <p>Johnson, 35, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2017/4/10/15244722/ufc-210-anthony-johnson-bids-farewell-instagram-retires-his-rumble-nickname-mma">abruptly retired from combat sports</a> following a submission loss to Daniel Cormier at UFC 210 back in early 2017, a surprising turn of events when you consider his only two losses at 205 pounds came against the former champ.</p>
      <p>“Rumble” holds knockout wins over Alexander Gustafsson and Glover Teixeira, just to name a few.</p>
      <p>In the two-plus years Johnson has remained inactive, he’s certainly kept himself busy outside the cage. First there was the <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2017/5/15/15642344/anthony-johnson-left-ufc-open-cannabis-facility-medical-uses-mma">cannabis facility</a>, then the <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/11/6/18068194/285-pound-anthony-johnson-wants-ufc-heavyweight-comeback-jon-jones-mma">bodybuilding career</a>, followed by his <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/2/2/18208912/anthony-rumble-johnson-partners-up-with-bare-knuckle-fighting-championship-mma-ufc">ambassador role</a> in bare-knuckle boxing ... heck, he even carved out some time <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/5/7/18535976/anthony-johnson-declared-indigent-due-back-in-court-on-june-6-domestic-violence-mma">to become homeless</a>.</p>
      <p>One thing is for certain, Johnson won’t be able to make his UFC return until <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/3/8/18255979/anthony-johnson-restraining-order-following-accusations-threats-online-stalking-mma">his current restraining order</a> expires in February.</p>
