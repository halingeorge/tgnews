      <p>On Monday, Chick-fil-A announced it was making a major change to perhaps the most controversial part of the company: its charitable-giving arm.</p>
      <p>In a press release, the company said it would "deepen its giving to a smaller number of organizations working exclusively in the areas of education, homelessness and hunger." A Chick-fil-A representative confirmed that the company would no longer donate to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-explains-donations-groups-considered-anti-gay-2019-5">two organizations that have been criticized by LGBTQ advocates</a>.</p>
      <p>"We made multiyear commitments to both organizations, and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018. Moving forward you will see that the Chick-fil-A Foundation will support the three specific initiatives of homelessness, hunger and education," the representative said in a statement to Business Insider.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-foundation-rodney-bullard-donation-strategy-2019-5">previously worked with the groups to fund specific programs</a> — such as summer camps — that work directly with underprivileged children.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A said that for 2020 it has committed $9 million each to those three initiatives: education, homelessness, and hunger. The company said that it was expanding partnerships with the education nonprofit Junior Achievement USA and the homeless-youth organization Covenant House International and that it would dedicate $25,000 to a local food bank following each new Chick-fil-A opening.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-backlash-as-expands-into-uk-2019-10">Chick-fil-A has faced backlash</a> for its donations and those of its top executives for years. Before 2012, Chick-fil-A made significant donations to right-wing and religious organizations known for lobbying against LGBTQ rights through the WinShape Foundation.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A stopped making donations to almost all of those controversial groups after facing backlash in 2012, when CEO Dan Cathy said he did not support same-sex marriage. However, the company continued its relationships with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>Rodney Bullard, the head of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-explains-donations-groups-considered-anti-gay-2019-5">defended the donations in an interview with Business Insider earlier this year</a>, saying they were "relevant and impactful in the community."</p>
      <p>"For us, that's a much higher calling than any political or cultural war that's being waged," Bullard said.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A has expanded significantly in recent years. By the end of 2018, Chick-fil-A was the third-largest chain in the US by sales, growing revenue by 16.7% in 2018 to reach nearly $10.5 billion, <a href="https://www.nrn.com/data-research/top-200-restaurants">according to Nation's Restaurant News</a>. Only McDonald's and Starbucks brought in more money in the US last year, and with vastly more restaurants.</p>
      <p>As Chick-fil-A has expanded into new regions, it has faced backlash as a chain with an anti-LGBTQ reputation. In October, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-backlash-as-expands-into-uk-2019-10">news broke that the six-month lease of a pilot location in the UK would not be renewed</a> amid a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2951433151553379/?active_tab=about">protest</a> with the stated goal of enlightening "potential patrons to the Chick-fil-A chain and their anti LGBT+ stance."</p>
