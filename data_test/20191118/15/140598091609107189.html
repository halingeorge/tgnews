      <h1>Retired Scotland Yard chief tackled to the ground after using old police pass to dodge train fare, court hears</h1>

      <p>A retired Scotland Yard detective who led the response to the 7/7 terror attacks was chased and rugby-tackled to the ground after being caught trying to dodge a train fare.</p>
      <p>Brian Tarpey, a 58-year-old counter-terror expert, used his old warrant card to avoid paying for a £7.40 ticket and tried to run away when confronted at Victoria Station. </p>
      <p>Serving Metropolitan Police officers receive free travel within a 70-mile radius of the capital and their professional standards department were making checks at Victoria Station this was not being abused.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates Court that Tarpey had “had identified himself at the ticket barrier as a police officer and flashed his warrant card”.</p>
      <p>"When one of the professional standards officers spoke to Mr. Tarpey he admitted he was not a police officer and did not have a ticket.</p>
      <p>"The defendant began to run and the police officers gave chase and told him to stop running. He continued to run to the platform exit and the pursuit continued into the street.”</p>
      <p>The chasing officer said in his statement: "He was fiddling around with something and I was concerned he was reaching for a weapon and took him to the ground and he was arrested and handcuffed."</p>
      <p>Tarpey, of The Green, Ewell, Surrey pleaded to impersonating a police officer on May 2, with intent to deceive and travelling without paying his £7.40 fare.</p>
      <p>A charge of stealing the warrant card was withdrawn. He was conditionally discharged for 12 months and ordered to pay £85 costs, a £20 victim surcharge and £7.40 compensation.</p>
      <p>Tarpey told police he “couldn’t explain” why he did not pay for a ticket. </p>
      <p>"Yes I was dishonest and stupid and I knew I had done something wrong.”</p>
      <p>He denied previously using the warrant card for free travel, adding: "No, I wish I never had. Look, I did a stupid thing running off like that."</p>
      <p>Tarpey had a distinguished 30 year career with the Met, which saw investigate the polonium poisoning murder of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. He was the anti-terror duty officer on 7/7 and directed the initial response. </p>
      <p>Tarpey was on leave when he retired on May 31, 2010, meaning there was no final-day handover and the warrant card remained in the bottom of a satchel for years.</p>
