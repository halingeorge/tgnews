      <h1>Door remains open for Bristol Rovers winger Kyle Bennett despite fresh interest from Swindon Town</h1>
      <h2>The 29-year-old has struggled to hold down a first-team place</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Graham Coughlan insists Kyle Bennett can play his way back into the Bristol Rovers team but understands why the winger may be thinking of leaving the club in January.</p>
      <p>Swindon manager <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-swindon-kyle-bennett-3536454">Richie Wellens admitted after last Wednesday's</a> 1-0 loss to Rovers in the EFL Trophy that he would be interested in bringing the 29-year-old back to the County Ground, claiming he's a manager who "understands him".</p>
      <p>Bennett excelled on loan in Wiltshire in the second half of last season but with the Robins unable to finance a permanent transfer in the summer, was brought back into the first-team fold by Coughlan.</p>
      <p>The winger started the first game of the season against Blackpool but once the Gas switched to a 3-5-2 formation couldn't be accommodated in the XI and since then has been sporadically involved, with mixed results.</p>
      <p>Bennett has played just 107 League One minutes since September 1 and with less than a year on his contract, his days at the Mem appear numbered but Coughlan isn't giving up on him just yet.</p>
      <p>"I don't fall into the trap of speaking about players who are at another club," Coughlan said, in reference to Wellens' comments.</p>
      <p>"Kyle is a tidy player, he's a decent player - if he's not playing, he wants to get out on loan, that's standard.</p>
      <p>"He's got a good affinity with Swindon and Richie. There's opportunity and chance for Kyle there.</p>

      <p>"But he's in the squad (here) every week so it's up to him. I just want people to go and grab the jersey, impose themselves and make it difficult for me - stay in the team and be consistent.</p>
      <p>"The ball is always in the player's court. I don't take people out, I don't put them on the bench, I don't drop them - if the players are playing well enough, they stay in the team.</p>
      <p>"Realistically, the manager will pick a team but I'll only pick what I see.</p>
      <p>"At this moment in time it's not happened for Kyle at this football club, but that's not just now since I've come in, that's been previous.</p>
      <p>"I don't know where his mindset is, where is head is, but there is still opportunity and I won't close the door on any player - my squad isn't big enough.</p>
      <p>"But I know Kyle will be the same as any other player in the changing room, if they're not playing they'll want to go out on loan. That's natural because all players want to play."</p>
      <p>Bennett is regularly spoken about within the dressing room as being one of the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kyle-bennett-conundrum-chance-unbeaten-3357296">most skilled individuals</a> within the Rovers squad and possesses creative attributes that this Gas team can often lack.</p>

      <p>But ever since he arrived at the Mem from Portsmouth in February 2018, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/could-kyle-bennett-save-bristol-3072976">he's been unable to transfer talent</a> into consistent production and has remained an enigmatic, and expensive, figure of frustration for supporters.</p>
      <p>In terms of being able to put his finger on exactly why Bennett has never fully established himself in a blue and white jersey, Coughlan floated the theory of the unique pressure and expectation of being a Bristol Rovers player.</p>
      <p>"He's a talented player," Coughlan added. "I played with one or two players, they were scoring goals, they were flying and then when you bring them to the club, maybe it's the arena, the size of the club, the mentality ...</p>
      <p>"And you need a totally different mentality when playing for Bristol Rovers, then you do where Kyle has been previously. This is a totally different beast when you take to that pitch.</p>
      <p>"Kyle would be the best person to speak to regarding that but it just hasn't come off for him. But, there is still opportunity at this football club and as long as he's here, I'll continue to work with him."</p>
