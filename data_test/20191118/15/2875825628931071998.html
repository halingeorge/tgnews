      <h1>Video shows group of crows repeatedly 'ice skating' down frosty roof of Cork on Ice</h1>
      <h2>'We'll have to charge them next time'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:42:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/andrew-byrne/" target="_blank">Andrew Byrne</a></address>
      <p>A group of crows were filmed repeatedly "<a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ice-skating">ice skating</a>" down an icy roof on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/viral-videos">video</a> was filmed in the early hours of the morning in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cork">Cork city</a> as the birds used the ice covered roof of Cork on Ice to slide down.</p>
      <p>Originally, the video shows just one bird performing the unusual act but as the camera spans across the roof a number of other crows are seen doing the same thing.</p>
      <p>The footage was filmed by Paddy O'Shea on the Centre Park Road before posting the video on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>.</p>

      <p>The freelance lighting technician told the Irish Mirror: "I was working on the lighting set up for Cork on Ice so I was on site early.</p>
      <p>"There was a bunch of crows messing about on the ice covered roof of the marquee.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was very funny that the crows were ice skating on the roof of the Cork ice rink."</p>

      <p>He added: "We'll have to charge them next time."</p>
      <p>The video has been praised online with one Twitter user saying: "They're clever yokes!"</p>
      <p>While another added: "Coup for city as Winter Crow-lympics hosted in Cork."</p>
      <p>The ice rink opens at the end of the week on the 22nd of November but these "early birds" just couldn't wait.</p>
