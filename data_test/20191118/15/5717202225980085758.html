      <h1>James Maddison has enormous praise for Liverpool star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:43:57+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>James Maddison has reacted <a href="https://twitter.com/itvfootball/status/1196104634882043908">to an interview between Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and ITV</a> on Twitter by heaping enormous praise on the Liverpool star, describing the ex-Arsenal man as “right out of the top draw”.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain, 26, was asked about his bad timing with injuries. The Reds ace injured his MCL days before the dismal 2014 World Cup, before suffering exactly the same injury during the season prior to Euro 2016 – which saw England lose to Iceland.</p>
      <p>The Southampton academy product perservered though, and he was a key part of 2018 World Cup qualifying. He scored against Scotland in a 2-2 draw, before suffering an injury that Gareth Southgate describes “as bad as you can get”.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain tore his ACL, while his hamstring came away from the bone. The attacking midfielder was forced to undergo complete knee reconstruction, ending his chances of a place at the 2018 World Cup.</p>

      <p>However, over the last international break, Oxlade-Chamberlain started both games against Montenegro and Kosovo – even scoring in the 7-0 win, which was his first goal for England since the one in the 2-2 draw with Scotland.</p>
      <p>The interview is an emotional one and it has certainly caught the attention of Leicester City’s £80m-rated (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7529787/Manchester-United-continue-track-Leicester-Citys-James-Maddison-ahead-potential-80m-move.html">Mail</a>) Maddison, who took to Twitter to applaud Oxlade-Chamberlain with a heartfelt Tweet.</p>
