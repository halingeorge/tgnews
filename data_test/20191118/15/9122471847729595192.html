      <h1>What The Week 13 BCS Rankings Would Look Like</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:28:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 brought a ton of drama to the college football landscape. Two more teams suffered their first loss of the season, while the Alabama lost their quarterback for the year.</p>
      <p>But how would the drama of the past weekend affect the BCS Rankings if we were using the old system?</p>
      <p>Based on the results, weâ€™re still on pace for a rematch of the 2008 BCS National Championship Game. LSU was ranked No. 1 and Ohio State was ranked No. 2, the same as last week.</p>
      <p>But the Tigers saw their BCS score increase while the Buckeyes saw theirs decrease.</p>
      <p>Clemson stayed at the same place, but Georgia jumped over Alabama and Oregon to take fourth place.</p>

      <p>Barring one of the undefeated teams losing a game in the final few weeks, it looks like we know at least three of the teams that will ultimately compete for the national title.</p>
      <p>Georgia will get its chance to stake a claim in a few weeks when they head to the SEC Championship Game.</p>
      <p>Even so, it still seems as though LSU and Ohio State are the teams to beat. Will the two college football powers breeze through to a national title showdown?</p>
