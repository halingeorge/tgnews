      <h1>Ministry condemns fake letter criticising PM</h1>

      <p>Ministry of Interior spokesman Khieu Sopheak said on Monday that police will investigate who was behind a “fake” letter purportedly from Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) members in Battambang province, which called on Hun Sen to be removed as prime minister and CPP president.</p>
      <p>The remarks came after an open letter with a forged CPP stamp on Wednesday said that the report on the EU’s “Everything But Arms” (EBA) agreement would cost Cambodia more than $2 billion a year.</p>
      <p>The letter called on the standing committee members of the CPP to immediately organise a vote of no confidence in Hun Sen as the party’s president and prime minister.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Friday morning in response to the letter at the 8th Workshop on Interfaith Dialogue to Strengthen Religious Harmony at Chaktomuk Conference Hall in Phnom Penh, Minister of Interior Sar Kheng said it was part of a dishonest plan to cause friction within the party.</p>
      <p>“We object to it and it comes from the opposition group. I have already arranged for K85 and the CPP working group in Battambang to reject it.</p>
      <p>“It is the opposition’s ill intentions aiming to divide the party internally. We reject it absolutely and will not tolerate it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Later on Friday, the party’s committee in the province issued a statement declaring the letter to be fake, saying it was intended to confuse the public and the international community.</p>
      <p>“We would like to request the authorities to investigate and pursue the offenders so they can be punished under the laws in place for such scurrilous activities. They are using a new trick to instigate venomous incitement that is unacceptable.</p>
      <p>“We would all like to announce total support for the leadership of Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, the CPP’s president and the prime minister of the Kingdom,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>Sopheak on Monday expressed frustration regarding the letter, and said the police would investigate the matter to identify the individuals who wrote it and bring them to justice.</p>
      <p>“It’s ridiculous. They think they’re clever in choosing the province that is led by Samdech Krala Hoam [Sar Kheng]. They didn’t choose other provinces.</p>
      <p>“It is true that the letter is entirely fake and aims to divide the CPP internally. Unidentified individuals have tried to divide the party since 1979.</p>
      <p>“Sooner or later, we will found out who is behind it. We will investigate and find those responsible and bring them to justice,” he said.</p>
