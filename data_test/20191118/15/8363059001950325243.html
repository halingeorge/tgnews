      <h1>The First Lego Top Gear Set is Here, in the Form of a Technic Rally Car</h1>

      <p>Back at the end if September Lego announced that it would be making sets based on the <i>Top Gear </i>brand, even though most people stopped caring about it a while ago. Well now the first set has been revealed, and it's a Rally Car.</p>
      <p>The set has been designed in collaboration with BBC Studios, and is designed to look like an authentic GT Rally Car. What makes it <i>Top Gear</i> though? Well it has a big logo on either side, and various 'STIG' markings on different parts of the car.</p>

      <p>Of course it wouldn't be complete without something extra, and the car does come with remote controls that can be accessed from Lego's CONTROL+ smartphone app. So it's another Lego car that can be controlled from your phone, which is fitting considering the <i>Top Gear</i> partnership.</p>
      <p>The Top Gear Rally Car has 436 pieces, and measures 27cm long, 15cm wide, and 10cm high. It'll go on sale on 26th December for £125. [<a href="https://brickset.com/article/46989/42109-top-gear-rally-car-revealed!">Brickset</a>]</p>
