      <p>About 30 people were at the Fresno home for a "quiet" and "peaceful" family party to watch <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/football">football</a> before it turned into a "mass casualty event," Fresno Police Chief Andrew Hall said at a news conference Monday.</p>
      <p>Just before 8 p.m. local time, at least two suspects, both armed with pistols, walked into the backyard "and began immediately firing into the crowd," Hall said.</p>
      <p>About 16 men were in the backyard at the time, he said, and 10 of those 16 men were struck by bullets.</p>

      <p>The CEO of the Fresno Center, Pao Yang, said two of the victims who died were well-known singers in the Hmong community.</p>
      <p>"They come out and perform... especially gearing up for Hmong New Year," Yang said. "Our community is in mourning."-</p>
      <p>The four people killed were all men, ages 23, 31, 38 and 40 years old, according to the chief.</p>
      <p>The suspects never entered the home, where the rest of the partygoers were, according to police. Witnesses described only seeing flashes of light from the gun, the chief said.</p>
      <p>Children were inside the home but none of them were hurt, authorities said. The house was not struck.</p>

      <p>The unknown suspects fled on foot, said Hall.</p>
      <p>He described the mass shooting as a "targeted act of violence against this residence" and said some people at this home may have been involved in a disturbance earlier this week. While the attack seemed targeted, the gunmen appeared to fire at random, Hall said.</p>
      <p>There is no indication that anyone at the home was affiliated with a gang, Hall said, adding, "at this point we have not ruled gang involvement out."</p>
      <p>Authorities are "investigating several leads" and the Fresno Police Department is forming an Asian gang task force, according to Hall. Fresno Police Capt. Anthony Martinez said the shooting was in a district with a lot Hispanic families and Southeast Asian families, especially those from the Hmong community.</p>
      <p>"That entire neighborhood was victimized when this took place," Martinez said.</p>
      <p>Fresno Mayor Lee Brand said in a statement, "Those responsible for this horrific crime will face the full force of justice. The City of Fresno will not tolerate this type of violence in any of our neighborhoods."</p>
      <p>Two of the injured victims remain in the hospital and are in stable condition, Hall noted.</p>
