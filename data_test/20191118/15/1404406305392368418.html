      <p>Spaceghostpurrp recently posted a video of him airing out his frustrations with Tory Lanez’s last project ‘Chixtape 5’ and went on to threaten Lanez.</p>
      <p>According to SGP, Lanez’s new project is based on the woman Purp is currently dating, which led the rapper to say, “I got your girl bruh. She with a real n***a. You over here making love songs about her. She’s over here kicking with me. You gotta get your mind right.” Further along in the video, Purp says, “You so much of a bitch I'll shoot you in your leg...and have you walk around with one leg.”</p>
      <p>SGP also called out Lanez for working with T-Pain, and called T-Pain a “fat koala a** n***a.” Watch above.</p>
