      <h1>Is This Tesla's New Cybertruck?</h1>
      <h2>If so, it looks unlike anything else.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:15:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>This is a big week for Tesla CEO Elon Musk. If everything goes according to plan, on Thursday, November 21, Tesla will <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-is-when-the-tesla-pickup-will-arrive">unveil its first-ever pickup truck</a> in Los Angeles not far from the SpaceX rocket factory. Musk previously referred to the EV truck as the "Cybertruck" claiming that its exterior design resembles something straight out of the movie "Blade Runner." The fact that classic sci-fi film was set in November 2019 is no coincidence. Musk is an awesome nerd at heart.</p>
      <p>Twitter user and venture capitalist Jonathon Drake also made an interesting discovery: Tesla applied trademarks for the names Cybertruck and CBRTRK, along with a logo. It also registered the domain cybrtrk.com. It sure sounds like Cybertruck is the official name, but we'll know everything in just a few days' time.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, a user from the newly created <a href="https://www.cybrtrkownersclub.com/forum/index.php?threads/tesla-cybrtrk-logo-forms-truck-outline.1/#post-80">cybrtrkownersclub.com</a> has created and posted a rendering showing a possible outline of the new truck. It shows the supposed Cybertruck logo in two ways: spelled out and rearranged to show the outline of what appears to be a truck. The user simply took that silhouette and turned it into a more realistic rendering. And yes, it does look very Blade Runner-esque. This general design also seems to fit the teaser image Tesla released earlier in the month showing what appears to be a truck bed. Musk has previously bragged that the Tesla pickup truck won't look like anything else on the market and this fan-made rendering certainly reflects that.</p>

      <p>At a previous event, Musk stated that the truck's goal "is to be a better truck than a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/f-150">Ford F-150</a> in terms of truck-like functionality and be a better sports car than a standard <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/911-carrera">Porsche 911</a>." Bold words.</p>
      <p>With a starting price of less than $50,000, the Cybertruck will offer a reported 400 to 500 miles of range, more than enough for all of your daily truck needs. Tesla's Cybertruck reveal will be happening at the same time as the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, so no doubt there will be competition for everyone's attention. Stay tuned.</p>
