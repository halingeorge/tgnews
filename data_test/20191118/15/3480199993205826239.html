      <p>The 18-year-old woman has been bailed while police investigate the collision in Commins Coch, near Machynlleth, in which Ellie Bryan, also 18, died.</p>
      <p>The crash happened on the A487 at around 10pm, and involved two vehicles.</p>
      <p>Police enquiries later revealed the involvement of a third vehicle, and it was the driver of this car who was arrested.</p>
      <p>Tributes have been paid to Ellie, from Aberystwyth. Her family said: “We are distraught by our loss of Ellie. She will be missed by us all.</p>
      <p>“Ellie was a loving daughter, sister and granddaughter.</p>
      <p>“We would like to thank everyone for their support at this devastating time.</p>
      <p>“We would appreciate having time to grieve in privacy.”</p>
      <p>A second person remains in hospital in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>Police are now appealing for people who were travelling along the stretch of road at the time and have dash cam footage or saw the collision to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit.</p>
