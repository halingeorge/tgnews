      <p><b>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)</b> - Pennsylvania's prison agency is agreeing to improve death row conditions to settle a lawsuit that described the condemned inmates' treatment as degrading and inhumane.</p>
      <p>The Corrections Department and lawyers for the inmates who sued announced an agreement Monday that provides people on death row with at least 42½ hours a week out of their cell, daily access to phones and contact visits with their families, lawyers and religious advisers.</p>
      <p>The settlement also limits the use of strip searches, shackling and other restraints unless temporarily needed.</p>
      <p>Death row inmates who have been psychologically damaged by long periods in solitary confinement will be evaluated and offered help adapting to a general population setting.</p>
      <p>A Wolf administration spokesman confirmed the settlement and said many of the agreement's changes have already been adopted.</p>
