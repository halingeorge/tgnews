      <h1>Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson injury updates ahead of Crystal Palace vs Liverpool</h1>

      <p>Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson are doubts for Liverpool's clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>Winger Salah and left-back Robertson are both undergoing rehabilitation for ankle injuries - which have been closely monitored throughout the international break.</p>
      <p>Egyptian Salah has been suffering from his damaged ankle since the Reds' 2-1 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on October 5 - after Foxes midfielder Hamza Choudhury fouled him.</p>
      <p>He missed the next fixture against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and aggravated the injury, after an tackle from Fernandinho, during the victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> just before the international break.</p>

      <p>Klopp revealed that Salah regularly had his foot drained and before the City game said: “I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that the injury always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that."</p>
      <p>Salah gave an insight to fans the treatment on his ankle last week when he posted a video of him with a physio and was spotted wearing a protective boot in his homeland.</p>
      <p>Scotland international Robertson had a swollen ankle after the City win which forced him to sit out of the international break.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-injury-17274638">The Liverpool Echo</a> report that like Salah his is a doubt for the fixture against Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Robertson was left frustrated by his inability to skipper his national side for their Euro 2020 qualifiers with Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>Robertson said: “I don’t care what game it is, I want to play it and my track record in the last five years has shown that," he said. "But I don’t want to pick up more injuries and ruin my season because of it.</p>
      <p>"I’ve had to listen to the people around me when previously I would have told them to beat it. The fact my ankle has swollen up again has made it easier to miss these games.</p>
      <p>"For the last two and a half weeks I’ve not trained at all for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> . I’ve trained the day before a game, missed a Champions League game other than the last 15 minutes against Genk and missed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the League Cup.”</p>
      <p>The pair are just two of five Liverpool players who were pulled out of international duty - and could miss out on the Palace game.</p>
      <p>Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson are also all being monitored, while Virgil Van Dijk skipped Holland duty for "personal reasons".</p>
