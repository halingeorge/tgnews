      <p>China's ambassador to Britain on Monday warned against any "external interference" in Hong Kong, where months of <a href="https://www.wionews.com/opinions/hong-kong-police-legitimacy-draining-away-amid-spiral-of-rage-and-retaliation-262898">protests have erupted into increasingly violen</a>t confrontations.</p>
      <p>At a press conference in London, Liu Xiaoming singled out Britain and the United States for meddling in internal Chinese affairs.</p>
      <p>"We would like to tell those external forces that the Chinese government remains steadfast... to oppose any" external interference in Hong Kong affairs, he said.</p>
      <p>The comments came as Britain, the former <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/chinese-defence-ministry-defends-deploying-soldiers-in-hong-kong-calls-it-most-pressing-task-262844">colonial power in Hong Kong</a>, expressed concerns about the escalation of violence between protesters and authorities.</p>
      <p>Riot police on Monday sought to dislodge several hundred pro-democracy protesters who occupied a university and had set fire to its main entrance.</p>
      <p>Police, who have in recent days been attacked with arrows, used tear gas and fired live rounds.</p>
      <p>"The UK is seriously concerned by the escalation in violence from both the protesters and the authorities around Hong Kong university campuses," the British Foreign Office said. </p>
      <p>"It is vital that those who are injured are able to receive appropriate medical treatment, and that safe passage is made available for all those who wish to leave the area. </p>
      <p>"We need to see an end to the violence, and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue ahead of the District Council elections on Sunday."</p>
      <p>Liu Xiaoming accused the protesters of trying to destabilise and paralyse Hong Kong to "seize power".</p>
      <p>"Hong Kong citizens live under black terror created by violent extremism with their life and property under severe threat," he said.</p>
      <p>He warned that Hong Kong was "sliding into the abyss" and if the violence continues, "the future will be unimaginably dreadful".</p>
      <p>"The once Oriental star is turning into the Oriental scar," he told reporters.</p>
