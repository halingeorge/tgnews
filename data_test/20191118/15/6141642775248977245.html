      <p>The former High Sheriff of Derbyshire was swept away for half a mile after driving into floodwater, an inquest has heard.</p>
      <p>Annie Hall’s body was recovered from flooded farmland close to the River Derwent in Darley Dale, near Matlock, in the early hours of November 8.</p>
      <p>Chesterfield Coroner’s Court heard how the car Mrs Hall and her husband had been driving in became “partially submerged” and both had exited the vehicle after the engine seized at around 1am.</p>

      <p>A post-mortem examination confirmed her cause of death as drowning and that she sustained no head injuries.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hall, who lived in Ashford-in-the-Water near Bakewell, served as the county’s High Sheriff – a ceremonial role representing the sovereign – in 2017 and has been described as a “great leader”.</p>
      <p>Her death came after parts of the Midlands and northern England were battered by a month’s worth of rain in one day.</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately, the car became partially submerged, the engine seized and they left the vehicle on foot.</p>
      <p>“She subsequently went into more floodwater and we believe she got swept away by the current.”</p>
      <p>Mr Bateman continued: “Her body was recovered from flooded farmland approximately half a mile from where she was last seen.</p>
      <p>“The doctor confirmed her death at the scene.”</p>
      <p>After her death, Mrs Hall’s family released a statement which said: “It is with great sadness that we, the family of Annie Hall, report her sudden passing.</p>
      <p>“We are in great shock and grieving.”</p>
      <p>Senior Coroner for Derby and Derbyshire, Dr Robert Hunter, adjourned the inquest until a date to be fixed.</p>
