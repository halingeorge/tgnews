      <p><b>(CNN) - </b>Jeopardy is bringing the brainpower! The game’s top three winners will quiz their way toward $1 million.</p>
      <p>Call it the battle royale of game shows as Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter and James Holzhauer compete in the challenge.</p>
      <p>Here's how it will work: the three champs will compete in a series of matches and the first player to win three will receive a cool million and be crowned the "greatest of all time."</p>
      <p>The other two contestants will walk away with $250,000 each.</p>
      <p>Each man boasts some pretty impressive stats already. Jennings won a record 74 games straight, Rutter hauled in the most money, and Holzhauer holds the title for top single-game winnings.</p>
      <p>Jeopardy host Alex Trebek says this competition should set the record straight on who is the best of the best.</p>
      <p>It will air starting Jan. 7 in prime time on ABC.</p>
