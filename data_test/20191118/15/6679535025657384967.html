      <h2>HC hopes govt. would not obstruct workers resuming duty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:19:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Marri-Ramu-668/" target="_blank">Marri Ramu</a></address>
      <p>The 45-day-long strike by TSRTC workers, longest one in its history, is likely to end with their counsel D. Prakash Reddy informing the Telangana High Court on Monday that they were ready to resume duty since the State government was ‘not taking any step forward’.</p>
      <p>While making this submission, the senior counsel requested the HC to direct the government to facilitate the workers’ withdrawal of strike. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, however, declined to pass such an instruction but hoped the government would not create any obstacles upsetting the workers’ decision to call off the strike.</p>
      <p>The employees, who decided to withdraw the agitation in the larger interest of general public, were a bit apprehensive of the government’s response on the matter, the senior counsel said. This doubt got generated in the minds of workers as the TSRTC MD in-charge Sunil Sharma filed an affidavit three days ago maintaining that striking workers made it difficult for the RTC management to take a call on their continuance even if they voluntarily resume duty, Mr. Reddy told the court.</p>
      <p>Citing a Supreme Court verdict, the senior counsel contended that employer should not view the strike by workers as abandonment of jobs. It should be considered as an attempt of raising demands for better working conditions or wages. Taking a note of the observation made by the apex court, the bench remarked that the State should be a ‘model employer’.</p>
      <p>“It should show generosity towards an erring employee...The strike should not be seen as a fight between the corporation and the workers,” the bench observed. It was not the question of the jobs of 48,000 individuals but issue related to 48,000 families depending on them, the bench said.</p>
      <p>In the backdrop of the high degree of unemployment, it would be difficult for the 48,000 employees to find new jobs. It would be an impossible task for them to find new jobs if the corporation decides not to take them back, the bench said.</p>
      <p>The bench instructed the Labour Commissioner to refer the strike matter to the appropriate authority or tribunal as per the provisions of the Industrial Disputes (ID) Act within a stipulated time of two weeks from the receipt of the court’s order copy. If the matter was not referred to the tribunal concerned or the Labour Court, the Commissioner should explain to the HC the cogent reasons behind that, the bench said.</p>
      <p>The bench said the Conciliation Officer’s declaration of the TSRTC strike as illegal should be ignored. The officer was not empowered to declare so. He had to only report the development of the conciliatory proceedings to the government, the HC said.</p>
