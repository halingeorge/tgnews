      <p>A complaining child sex abuser’s bid to have his 210 year jail sentence shortened has failed in spectacular style.</p>
      <p>Douglas Neumeyer, 51, was last week told that his 2016 trial had been totally fair – and that he wouldn’t be eligible for parole until at least 2081.</p>
      <p>Neumeyer of Huntington, West Virginia, unsuccessfully tried to claim he should have been granted access to records of his nine year-old victim’s chat with a counselor.</p>
      <p>He molested the little girl in his truck while parked outside a church in July 2007.</p>
      <p>Neumeyer had also tried to claim that his defense should have been given access to text messages exchanged between his victim and one of her friends.</p>

      <p>And he moaned that he should have been able to give a statement just before a judge sent him to jail.</p>

      <p>But the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals rejected all his efforts to derail his sentence, with Neumeyer now almost certain to die at the Mount Olive Correctional Complex in Fayette County, West Virginia.</p>
      <p>His traumatized victim kept the abuse secret for years, but eventually shared what had happened to her with a friend.</p>
      <p>She went on to tell her parents, who supported the girl and encouraged her to tell police about what had happened.</p>

      <p>He denied the allegations against him all the way through his trial, but has since admitted that his victim was telling the truth.</p>
