      <p>The Bayelsa State Governor-elect, Chief David Lyon, has promised to unite the entire people of the state no matter their political party differences.</p>
      <p>Lyon dedicated his victory at the concluded governorship election in the state to the people of Bayelsa and thanked them for believing and trusting in him.</p>
      <p>He ascribed his victory to God and resilient character of Bayelsans to withstand the forces of darkness, which tried in vain to hold unto political power.</p>
      <p>Lyon said he was overwhelmed that the people resisted intimidation and heavy financial inducement to cast their votes for him.</p>
      <p>He said despite the overbearing influence of the state government, which tried to compromise the electoral process, the people worked for his emergence.</p>
      <p>Lyon in a statement signed by his Media Aide. Chief Gift Ebiki, described his victory and APC as divine assignment to salvage the people from the shackles of guided oppression and internal colonialism.</p>
      <p>He said when inaugurated, he would hit the ground running to fulfil his promises of correcting all the mistakes of the PDP; ensuring electricity supply; giving the people potable water and solving problems of insecurity.</p>
      <p>Lyon asked his opponents to accept defeat and join him in building a better Bayelsa adding that the state was created for everyone and not a few individuals.</p>
      <p>He thanked all the stakeholders including security personnel, who worked assiduously to deliver a democratic process devoid of loss of lives in the state.</p>

      <p>He said: “My mandate is divine. I depend on God to direct my footsteps and the incoming administration to deliver the dividends of democracy which our people have been yearning for the past eight years.</p>
      <p>“We are determined to fulfil all our promises of providing security, power, love and peace and development for the people of Bayelsa. Bayelsa is one family, and no individual or group of persons irrespective of their political affiliations or standards can separate us from our collective destiny.</p>
      <p>“Our victory is a victory for all Bayelsans and we is extending hands of fellowship to our brother, Senator Douye Diri and all other contestants to join hands with us to form an all-inclusive government. There is no victor no vanquish in politics.</p>
      <p>“We will not be disunited because of Political differences. We must unite and move forward together, that is the next level agenda. We must integrate our state to the mainstream politics to attract rapid development into our state”.</p>
