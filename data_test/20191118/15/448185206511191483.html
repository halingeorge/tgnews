      <p><b>ABU DHABI:</b> Former Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed has called for the resumption of cricketing ties between India and Pakistan in order to improve the bilateral relations between the two neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>The two nations have not been involved in any bilateral series for a long time and have been meeting only at the ICC events. The last bilateral series took place in 2012-13 when India hosted Pakistan for three ODIs and two T20Is.</p>
      <p>“I think cricketing ties should resume between India and Pakistan. I feel cricket has the ability to bind the two nations and improve their relationship. Cricket brings love, it brings joy and happiness to the fans.</p>
      <p>“Thus, it is important for both the countries to play cricket against each other because fans want to watch them play,” Mushtaq told <i>IANS</i> on the sidelines of the ongoing Abu Dhabi T10 league.</p>
      <p>“Whenever India and Pakistan meet, the cricket is highly competitive. In fact, the India-Pakistan series is bigger than the Ashes,” he stated.</p>
      <p>The relations between the two Asian neighbours have further nosedived since August 5 when the Indian government abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution, thus ending the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>However, the recent opening of the Kartarpur Corridor is being seen as a positive step towards improving the bilateral relationship.</p>
      <p>“When we will play cricket, things will become easier. It provides politicians with a great opportunity to communicate and set things on the right track. And that’s why I think communication needs to be there between the two governments,” the 49-year old said.</p>
      <p>“Both countries should sit and discuss the situation and their problems. The recent opening of the Kartarpur Corridor is a great initiative for both nations. All issues can be solved when communication takes place. And sports, particularly cricket, can play a very big role in improving the bilateral ties between India and Pakistan,” he said.</p>
      <p>Talking about the recent performance of his home team, Mushtaq said that Pakistan cricket at present is going through a transition phase and with time, their performance will improve. IANS</p>
