      <p>Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Dmytro Razumkov has said the war in Donbas is not Ukraine's problem only.</p>
      <p>"We understand quite well that those events and the war that has been waged in our state are not exclusively our problem. Today, this is a global problem, and its consequences can hardly be overestimated," he said at a meeting with Speaker of the Lithuanian Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis, according to an UNIAN correspondent.</p>
      <p>Razumkov expressed gratitude for the fact that the Republic of Lithuania and many other states, realizing this, had been joining forces to preserve and restore peace in the world.</p>
      <p>Razumkov also said this was not the first visit of the Lithuanian speaker to Ukraine. He expressed the hope that such "warm, friendly and professional relations" would remain between the parliaments of two states in the future.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank you for the constant and steady support that we feel both from you personally and from your state, as well as from the so-called Baltic+ group," Razumkov said.</p>
