      <h1>I’m A Celebrity's launch episode pulls in almost one million less viewers than last year as Ant McPartlin returns</h1>
      <h2>Ant didn't host the show last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:07:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Carter</a></address>
      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> were thrilled last night when <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> returned alongside <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> for the new series.</p>
      <p>But the launch episode reportedly pulled in almost one million less viewers than last year's series - which was hosted by Dec and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> - as 10 million tuned in.</p>
      <p>The episode, which saw the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright and Roman Kemp head into the jungle, peaked at 10.9 million viewers, according to ITV.</p>

      <p>Last year's launch episode, which saw <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> presenter Holly stand in for Ant alongside Dec, drew in 11.6 million in the overnight ratings.</p>
      <p>Holly filled in for Ant as he took most of last year off following his drink-drive arrest earlier that year.</p>
      <p>It was the most-watched launch since 2013.</p>
      <p>Sunday's show saw Caitlyn, Ian, Roman, Jacqueline Jossa, Kate Garraway, James Haskell, Adele Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Andrew Maxwell and Myles Stephenson take on their first lot of challenges.</p>

      <p>They took on a string of challenges with Caitlyn and Nadine skydiving out of a plane from 10,000ft.</p>
      <p>Kate, Andrew, Jacqueline, Ian, Myles and Roman had to walk across a 300ft plank in very winding conditions.</p>
      <aside>So good to see Ant and Dec back together in the jungle.</aside>
      <p>Andrew, Caitlyn, James, Jacqueline, Kate and Ian failed to win the challenges and were sent to the less-than-luxury camp.</p>
      <p>Adele, Nadine, Myles and Roman were treated to Croc Creek.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, viewers expressed their delight over having Ant back with Dec.</p>

      <p>One person said on Twitter: "So glad to see @antanddec back together presenting @imacelebrity this year.</p>
      <p>"Ant isn't Ant without Dec and Dec isn't Dec without Ant especially when they're on tele. Amazing duo. I'M A CELEBRITY wouldn't be the same without them presenting."</p>
