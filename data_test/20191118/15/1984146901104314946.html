      <h1>Three years until Qatar 2022: How the Premier League will be affected by 2022 World Cup</h1>
      <h2>Major changes will occur in the Premier League for the 2021/22 season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:11:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>It is now three years until the 2022 World Cup in Qatar gets under way, by which point the talk should be around the football rather than the mess of hosting the tournament in the winter.</p>
      <p>FIFA have confirmed that the tournament will get underway on November 21, 2022, having ignored claims from major European leagues, including the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League,</a> that a winter tournament would not be desirable.</p>
      <p>The tournament will last just 28 days, making it the shortest World Cup since 1978, and the final will take place on December 18 - with the Premier League due to return just eight days later for the annual Boxing Day fixtures.</p>
      <p>Draft plans for the Premier League schedule have been shared between clubs, which could also mean that teams in the top-flight face their last matches before the break just nine days before the tournament begins.</p>
      <p>In order to facilitate the break, the season is set to start one week earlier and finish a week later - which means there would only be six weekends without Premier League matches during the course of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The subject has previously been discussed by Premier League shareholders this season and the proposals would clash with the plans from national associations, who usually allow several weeks for their players to prepare for the tournament.</p>
      <p>A break will also occur in the Championship, although it is not likely to be as long as the one in the Premier League, while football in League One and League Two will continue to be played during the World Cup.</p>
      <p>In terms of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league">Champions League</a> and Europa League, UEFA has stated that a decision on the scheduling of both tournaments will not be made until 2021.</p>
