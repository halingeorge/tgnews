      <h1>What Was in Motley Crue’s ‘Cessation of Touring’ Contract?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:33:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p>On Jan. 24, 2014, at a press conference in front of dozens of witnesses – and the world looking on via media coverage – the members of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/motley-crue/">Motley Crue</a> signed a document that they said prevented them from touring again after their <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-2014-final-tour/">farewell road trip</a>.</p>
      <p>The “Cessation of Touring Agreement” came into effect at the end of 2015, and contained a clause that meant <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/nikki-sixx/">Nikki Sixx</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/vince-neil/">Vince Neil</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/tommy-lee/">Tommy Lee</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/mick-mars/">Mick Mars</a> would be the subject of a lawsuit if they attempted to break the deal.</p>
      <p>“After more than three decades together, iconic rock ‘n' roll band Motley Crue announced today the Final Tour and the band’s ultimate retirement,” they said in a statement. “The announcement was solidified when the band signed a formal Cessation of Touring Agreement, effective at the end of 2015, in front of global media in Los Angeles today.”</p>
      <p>The news was accompanied by comments from the band members. “We always had a vision of going out with a big fucking bang and not playing county fairs and clubs with one or two original band members,” drummer Lee said. “Our job here is done.”</p>
      <p>Guitarist Mars added that their history had included “more drama than <i>General Hospital</i>." “It keeps ’em watchin’, and they keep comin’ back,” he added.</p>
      <p>Crue’s attorney, Doug Mark of Mark Music &amp; Media Law, was in attendance for the signing of the agreement – which, they emphasized, was the first of its kind. “Other bands have split up over rancor or the inability of people to get along,” Mark said. "But this is mutual among all four original members and a peaceful decision to move on to other endeavors and to confirm it with a binding agreement.”</p>

      <p>However, the details of the agreement were never made public. All that seemed certain was that Sixx, Neil, Lee and Mars could not use the name “Motley Crue” for touring after 2015. And even though they could be sued if they tried to break the deal, it wasn’t clear who’d do the suing.</p>
      <p>Even Crue’s manager, Chris Nilsson, was scant on details of the agreement when asked if it prevented them from reuniting for standalone events. “I’m not really sure,” he told <a href="https://www.pollstar.com/article/managing-mtley-cres-farewell-31665"><i>Pollstar</i></a> at the time. “One thing I will say is that I think it’s really important to them that they do what they agreed to do. They agreed that this will be the final tour. … I can’t really speak on the specifics of the agreement, but this is the final tour.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lawdepot.com/blog/what-makes-a-contract-invalid/">LawDepot</a> notes that, by law, a contract becomes “voidable” if “a party breaches the terms of the contract” and that the “party affected by the particular circumstance may choose to either set aside the contract or continue with it.” If it’s assumed that the four band members signed their agreement as four individual parties – Mark confirmed "everyone had their own counsel" – it follows that one or more of the four would have to want the contract to continue. If all four want to set it aside, it’s legally voidable.</p>
      <p>Responding to the suggestion that the deal could be broken, Sixx said at the signing, “You guys in the press, you keep looking for the loophole. We're gonna stick to our word.” "It would take all of us to agree to do something," Neil observed. "But I don’t see us going back on our word and saying, 'Aw, forget it, forget it you guys – we were just kidding,' you know? No, we won’t be doing any more concerts."</p>
      <p>However, a comment by Mark noted that the deal never had anything to do with preventing actual performances. "It's an agreement that binds the four of them to not utilize this trademark for touring in the future," he said, to which Sixx added, "Pretty simple."</p>
      <p>On November 18, 2019, Motley Crue announced their reunion by posting a video that showed the cessation agreement and the desk it was sitting on <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-blow-up-cessation-of-touring-agreement/">exploding into flames</a>. So yes, they managed to find a loophole.</p>

      <h3>Motley Crue Lineup Changes: A Complete Guide</h3>

      <h4>1981-1992: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>Motley Crue played their first show on April 24, 1981, opening for Y&amp;T at Hollywood's Starwood Hotel. Thanks in part to high-profile gigs as Ozzy Osbourne's opening act and at the US Festival, the often controversial group quickly rose to the top of the hard-rock landscape. Their sophomore album, 'Shout at the Devil,' cracked the Top 20 in 1983, and three more multi-platinum efforts followed before the close of the decade. In the fall of 1991 they signed a lucrative new record contract reportedly worth as much as $35 million. But personality conflicts and a difference of opinion about the band's musical direction led to singer Vince Neil's ouster in February 1992.</p>

      <h4>1992-1996: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, John Corabi</h4>
      <p>A year after Neil made a respectable start to his solo career with the Steve Stevens-powered 'Exposed' album, Motley Crue emerged with new singer John Corabi and a heavier, more serious sound. The new lineup's self-titled 1994 LP didn't connect well with most of the band's earlier audience, though it has since obtained a cult-favorite status among fans. The accompanying tour was poorly attended, and partway through the creation of a follow-up record, Corabi -- frustrated by what he deemed a dizzying series of changing creative directions -- parted ways with the band.</p>

      <h4>1996-1999: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>With Motley Crue's commercial fortunes in free fall, and Neil's sophomore album 'Carved in Stone' failing to crack the Top 100, the original foursome decided to reunite and complete the already in-progress 'Generation Swine' record. In retrospect, they probably would have been better starting fresh, as the final result was a muddled mess of material that was ill-suited to his vocal style. The following Motley Crue vs. the Earth tour was better received, and everything seemed to be back on track.</p>

      <h4>1999-2002: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Randy Castillo</h4>
      <p>Turns out the original lineup's second stint didn't last very long. Lee had grown eager to explore other forms of music. "I always told myself that when my heart wasn't in it, it was time to quit," he explained in the band's official autobiography 'The Dirt.' "And my heart wasn't in it." When he left to form the band Methods of Mayhem, Motley Crue replaced him with former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo, with whom they recorded 2000's back-to-basics 'New Tattoo.' A cancer diagnosis soon forced Castillo off the tour in support of the album and claimed his life in March 2002.</p>

      <h4>2000-2002: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Samantha Maloney</h4>
      <p>With Castillo sidelined for health reasons, Motley Crue enlisted former Hole drummer Samantha Maloney to play drums on the band's 'New Tattoo' tour. "The entire band was very supportive and respectful of me. I had the time of my life!," she told NRK. "Some of the fans at first were hesitant, but I won each and every fan over every night after song one." Maloney can be seen and heard on 2001's 'Lewd, Crued &amp; Tattooed' concert video, and would go on to work with Eagles of Death Metal and Peaches.</p>

      <h4>2004-2015: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>After a two-year hiatus, Motley Crue's original lineup reunited for the second time in 2004. "The only thing people ask us about is if we're getting along. Of course we get along," Lee told 'The Guardian,' addressing the band's previous public squabbles. "Time heals -- it's been six years. People change, grow up. I think we all have the attitude now that if we could just fucking get along instead of fucking with each other, we could continue to do this for as long as anybody wants to." Over the next decade, they released one more studio album (2008's 'Saints of Los Angeles'), headlined two editions of the Crue Fest festival and shared co-headlining bills with Aerosmith and Kiss before embarking on a farewell tour that concluded on New Year's Eve 2015.</p>

      <h4>June 2007: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Will Hunt</h4>
      <p>When an am injury forced Lee to miss two U.K. show on Motley Crue's 2007 summer tour, he reached out to Evanescence drummer and Crue fan Will Hunt. "I just happened to be in London for four days on a break," Hunt told MusicRadar in 2010. "Tommy called me and said, 'I need you to play tonight!'" Lee rallied enough to play "Kickstart My Heart" at one of the shows.</p>

      <h4>August 2009: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Morgan Rose</h4>
      <p>Two years later, another injury -- this time the result of playing with sparklers -- put Lee out of action for a pair of shows on the Crue Fest 2 tour. Sevendust drummer Morgan Rose was there to fill in. Eager to earn his keep, Lee hung around onstage to add backing vocals and play piano on "Home Sweet Home."</p>

      <h4>October 2015: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Glen Sobel</h4>
      <p>A tendinitis flareup knocked Lee off the drum stool for a handful of shows on the band's farewell tour. Alice Cooper was opening the entire tour, and his powerhouse drummer Glen Sobel was there to fill in, with Lee performing his by now customary "Home Sweet Home" duties.</p>
