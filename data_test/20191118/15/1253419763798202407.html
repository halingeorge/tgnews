      <h1>Ghostrunner, Mirror’s Edge meets Dishonored meets Blade Runner game, gets an official reveal trailer</h1>

      <p>3D Realms has released an official reveal trailer for Ghostrunner. Ghostrunner is a first-person “<i>Mirror’s Edge meets Dishonored meets Blade Runner</i>” game. Its first gameplay trailer came out in August 2019 so I don’t know why 3D Realms named this a “<i>reveal trailer</i>“.</p>
      <p>Ghostrunner promises to feature an intense cyberpunk world and dynamic combat. Players will conquer their enemies in the physical world and in cyberspace. Players will also hunt for answers in humanity’s last remaining shelter.</p>
      <p>The game takes place in the future, after a global cataclysm where the remains of humanity live in a tower built by The Architect, who died mysteriously years ago. The world ruled by The Keymaster is harsh and players assume the role of a cyber-warrior, the only one capable of fighting both in the physical world and in cyberspace.</p>
      <p>Players will have to use this bond with technology to ascend the tower. As they climb higher, they will reveal secrets, and the clock will start ticking on a race to uncover the mystery behind the structure that houses humanity’s last hope.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Ghostrunner will support real-time ray tracing effects. As the team noted, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX platform will fuse the AI capabilities, next-gen programmable shaders and real-time ray tracing. These will let players experience games in a completely new way.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
