        <b>The Worthy Farm festival turns 50 next summer – here’s everything you need to know about joining the big anniversary bash</b>
      </p>
      <p>The year 2020 sees <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury-2019">Glastonbury</a> celebrate the big 5-0, and the ensuing festivities are shaping up to be very special indeed. After humble beginnings – <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/glastonbury-festival-first-ever-story-1970-2510609">Michael Eavis hosted his first ever festival in 1970, for about 1,500 lucky attendees</a> – the event has evolved into one of the biggest festivals in the entire world, with a site that occupies roughly the same space as Oxford city centre. If you thought the 2019 edition of the festival was huge, then buckle up for a massive half century party that’ll take things up a thousand more notches. </p>
      <h3>What’s the latest news?</h3>

      <h3>When does Glastonbury 2020 take place?</h3>
      <p>In the aftermath of 2019’s Glastonbury, the festival’s official account shared the following poster on July 1. Along with teasing ahead of Glastonbury’s 50th birthday, it reveals the start date of the next edition as being June 24, 2020. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>This has also been confirmed on <a href="https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/tickets/">Glastonbury’s official website,</a> stating that next year’s festival will take place June 24-28 2020.</p>
      <h3>How much are Glastonbury tickets?</h3>
      <p>General tickets for <b>Glastonbury Festival 2020 will cost £265 + £5</b> booking fee per ticket. See below for individual coach ticket prices to be added on if that’s how you’re choosing to travel. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2019/09/glasto_coach.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Glastonbury 2020 coach ticket prices</p>
      <p>You may book up to six tickets per transaction by paying a deposit of £50 per person when tickets go on sale (plus the coach fare, if you are booking a coach package). Both UK and International ticket balances of £215 + £5 booking fee per ticket, will be payable in the first week of April 2020 (from 9:00 Wednesday April 1 – 23:59 Tuesday April 7).</p>
      <p>As ever, the price of the ticket included entry to the festival, five nights camping, a free programme and mini-guide, onsite newspaper and mobile charging points and free firewood. A portion of the ticket price is also donated to Oxfam, Greenpeace, WaterAid and hundreds of other worthy causes, while funds are also used to improve the site’s infrastructure and environmental impact.</p>
      <p>Prices last year increased by around £10 compared to the previous Glastonbury, which should give you a rough idea of what to expect. </p>

      <h3>Do I need to register to buy a ticket for Glastonbury 2020?</h3>
      <p>Yep. No registration, no ticket. You had until<b> 5pm on Monday September 30</b> to register for tickets to Glastonbury 2020. So if you haven’t already registered by now, you won’t be able to purchase tickets in the re-sale in April. </p>
      <p>If you’re already registered for Glastonbury tickets since 2010, relax – there’s no need to repeat the process. Can’t remember if you’ve filled one in? You can check your registration status <a href="https://glastonbury.seetickets.com/registration/lookup">here</a>. Organisers also recommend keeping your registration photo up to date, particularly if your appearance has changed drastically. It’s now possible to update the photo attached to your account while keeping your existing registration number.</p>
      <p>If you last registered for Glastonbury tickets before 2010, you will need to resubmit a new application ahead of October’s sale in order to buy tickets. Once set up on the system, it’s worth retrieving your registration number and noting it down ready for when ticket-buying time comes around.</p>
      <h3>Will I get to see the line-up before Glastonbury tickets go on-sale?</h3>
      <p>No – Glastonbury famously don’t announce any of their line-up ahead of tickets going on sale. It’s worth embracing the surprise, though – Glastonbury is always bursting with amazing acts of all varieties. The 2019 edition was headlined by Stormzy, The Killers and The Cure, with a legends slot from Aussie pop icon Kylie. </p>
      <h3>When will the Glastonbury line-up be announced?</h3>
      <p>Traditionally, the bulk of the major line-up announcement has been made in March or April a few weeks before the re-sale – with more acts and each individual stage’s full line-up then following in the months leading up to the festival. However, expect the odd headliner and a few other acts to be made as individual announcements in coming before all of that.</p>
      <h3>Who has been confirmed for the Glastonbury 2020 line-up so far? </h3>
      <h4>
        <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/DIANA-ROSS">Diana Ross</a>
      </h4>
      <p>The first act has finally been revealed, and it comes in the form of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/DIANA-ROSS">Diana Ross</a>. She’ll <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/diana-ross-confirmed-legends-slot-glastonbury-2020-2555785">play the Sunday Legends</a> teatime slot, <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/kylies-glastonbury-debut-14-years-late-surreal-pop-spectacle-fake-wedding-rainbow-confetti-two-famous-dudes">following in the footsteps of Kylie Minogue</a> in 2019. Bring it on.</p>

        <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/paul-mccartney">
          <b>Paul McCartney</b>
        </a>
      </h4>
      <p>Glastonbury’s father-daughter co-organising duo Emily and Michael Eavis have let slip with a few hints when it comes to the line-up for 2020 already. In April 2019, Michael said that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/glastonbury-2020-headliner-rumour-paul-mccartney-2474759">The Beatles legend Paul McCartney would be coming to Glastonbury</a>, “hopefully for the 50th. Don’t make a big thing of it though, will you?” he added, cat well and truly out the bag.</p>
      <p>McCartney then <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury/paul-mccartney-confirms-glastonbury-slot-cryptic-twitter-post-2568890">seemingly confirmed he was playing</a> by sharing a photo of Phillip Glass, Emma Stone and Chuck Berry. Later, confirmation came via Emily and Macca himself.</p>
      <p>Eavis wrote: “IT’S REAL!! So excited.. Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true. There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary.” McCartney added: “Hey Glasto – excited to be part of your Anniversary celebrations. See ya next summer!”</p>

      <h3>Who else is rumoured to be playing?</h3>
      <p>As far back as 2017, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/two-headliners-already-booked-for-glastonburys-50th-anniversary-2058104">Emily Eavis confirmed that two headliner bookings were already in the bag for 2020.</a> “Ideally, we’d have a mix of old and new acts headlining,” she told <i>NME</i>. “A bit of both. But, a lot can happen between now and then, and it’s about seeing who comes through and who would be right for us. It kind of depends, we’ve just got a little while, we’re not in any rush, but it’s quite exciting. It’s always good having something in the long term plans as well.” </p>
      <p>Talking to Jo Whiley at BBC Music Introducing Live at Tobacco Dock on October 31, Emily Eavis didn’t reveal who would be performing but <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/emily-eavis-says-that-glastonburys-other-stage-will-feature-pyramid-level-headliners-next-year-2563232">did say that the Other Stage will feature “Pyramid level headliners.”</a></p>
      <p>“…and then we’ve got our Other Stage headliners, which are amazing,” she said. “I think particularly because it’s the 50th, we’ve got kind of Pyramid level headliners on the Other Stage next year.”</p>
      <p>At the same event during a Q&amp;A, audience members have reported that Eavis said two of the Pyramid Headliners “haven’t headlined before.”</p>
      <p>So with all of these clues in mind, let’s run through the biggest rumours for who’ll be filling those six huge headline slots at Glasto 2020…</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-1975">The 1975</a>’s Matt Healy has also <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/1975s-matty-healy-whether-headline-glastonbury-2415886">confirmed that the band will be at the festival in 2020</a>, and speaking earlier this year, added that they feel “ready” for the top spot next summer. </p>
      <p>“I’ll be at Glastonbury [2020],” said Healy. “Whether we headline it or not, who knows? If I ever am headlining Glastonbury, then everyone’s going to have to be on guard for a year, so that I don’t completely lose my mind.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/1975s-matty-healy-whether-headline-glastonbury-2415886">Emily Eavis later responded to the frontman’s comments, saying: </a>“Oh really? That’s good. Interesting. They’re great. Obviously we’d love to have The 1975.”</p>

        <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/FLEETWOOD-MAC">Fleetwood Mac</a>
      </h4>
      <p>As ever, there’s also speculation about a potential headline spot for Fleetwood Mac – who are yet to play Worthy Farm. Back in June 2019, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fleetwood-mac-tease-glastonbury-2020-appearance-wembley-stadium-show-2509791">Mick Fleetwood told fans at their Wembley show that they still “had a big field to play”</a>, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/fleetwood-mac-interview-tour-uk-wembley-mick-christine-mcvie-stevie-nicks-a8887971.html"><i>The Independent </i></a>the band reiterated their desire to play Glastonbury.</p>
      <p>Appearing on the Acoustic Stage during Glastonbury 2019 on June 28, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-eavis-responds-speculation-fleetwood-mac-glastonbury-2020-2518723">Michael Eavis addressed the band’s comments,</a> saying: “I can’t afford them at the moment! They’ll have to bring their price down because we can’t afford it. But they said the other day that they really want to do it and if they don’t do it before they die they’ll go to hell.”</p>
      <p>Emily Eavis, however, has said that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fleetwood-mac-and-led-zeppelin-ruled-out-of-playing-glastonbury-2020-2556758">Fleetwood Mac would not be headlining in 2020</a> – but maybe she was trying trying to throw people off the scent?</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Want another big name to throw into the rumour mill? Step right up, Taylor Swift. The singer has <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-announces-2020-uk-european-festival-tour-2548885">announced a run of European festival dates as part of her summer 2020 ‘Lover’ Tour</a>. As it stands, she’s performing in Oslo on Friday June 26, meaning that she could grace Glastonbury with either a headline or surprise set on the Saturday or Sunday.</p>

        <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/madonna">Madonna </a>
      </h4>
      <p>Iconic as she is, Madonna has in fact never headlined Glastonbury festival. She was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/madonna-will-headline-glastonbury-2019-sources-claim-2344257">rumoured to be topping the bill last year</a>, but alas it was not to be. However, after releasing her <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/madonna-madame-x-review">acclaimed comeback album ‘Madame X</a>‘ since then, could this be her year?</p>
      <p>Bookmakers <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/betting/e/15850492/.html">William Hill</a> gives her odds of 8/1, and with her current tour wrapping up in March we’d say there’s a decent bet that she could be lining up some a few festival headline shows for the summer.</p>

      <p>Another bookies’ favourite who matches Emily Eavis’ description of a bill-topper who “hasn’t headlined before”. With fans expecting the follow-up to <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/kendrick-lamar-damn-review">2017’s acclaimed ‘DAMN</a>.’ soon and after <a href="http://nme.com/blogs/festivals-blog/kendrick-lamar-reading-headline-2371058">his stellar job headlining Reading &amp; Leeds in 2018</a>, we think there’s every chance that Kendrick could be the next rap god to make history at Glasto.</p>

      <p>When <a href="https://www.nme.com/foals-interview-everything-not-saved-will-be-lost-part-2-2019">NME asked Foals if they’d be returning to Glastonbury 2020</a>, frontman Yannis Philippakis replied: “Yeah, hopefully we’ll go back. We’d be well up for playing a non-secret show.”</p>
      <p>Go on then.</p>

      <p>Coldplay are basically the Glasto house band.

There are gaps in their schedule on Friday June 26 and Sunday June 28. Could any or all three of the bands be booked? Perhaps Green Day will headline, play the legends’ slot or play a secret show? Perhaps all of the stops will be pulled out for Glasto’s 50th anniversary.</p>

      <p>As for the big pop acts that tend to appear at Glastonbury, it could be <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/spice-girls">Spice Girls</a>. That’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-spice-girls-will-meet-to-discuss-glastonbury-2020-performance-2544495">according to Mel B</a>, who says the group will reconvene with Victoria Beckham to discuss the idea. Say you’ll be there?</p>
      <p>“My plan is for all five of us to do Glastonbury next year for the 50th anniversary,” she said in August. “I’m in the process of persuading Victoria to do it. And I will make it happen.”</p>

      <p>Swedish pop legends ABBA have been <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/abba-respond-glastonbury-rumours-calls-reunion-tour-2305697">the subject of Glastonbury rumours for years</a>, which only intensified when they <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/abba-release-first-new-material-35-years-new-songs-i-still-have-faith-in-you-2304583">revealed their plans to reform to record new material</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/a-virtual-abba-tour-is-set-to-take-place-in-2019-2139797">for a digital avatar tour</a>. New song ‘I Still Have Faith In You’ is due to premiere on a BBC documentary at some point, while another called ‘Don’t Shut Me Down’ has also been recorded. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/abba-new-album-bjorn-ulvaeus-2385887">Ulvaeus also hinted that the band’s recent recording sessions could lead to “a new album, possibly.”</a></p>
      <p>However, when asked by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0008ylm">Zoe Ball on BBC Radio 2</a> if they could be performing at Glastonbury 2020 for the festival’s 50th anniversary, he replied “Oh, no. It’s a straight, straight no”, adding that it would be “a hassle”.</p>
      <p>“We recorded some new songs and you’ll probably hear them next year, at least one of them, but that’s quite a different thing from going through the hassle of rehearsing and – just one show, it would be the same as doing a whole year of tours,” he added. “It would take 10 years out of our life.”</p>

        <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/biffy-clyro">Biffy Clyro</a>
      </h4>
      <p>The Biff are also being tipped by bookies as being in the running to headline Glastonbury 2020. Back in May, the Scottish alt-rock veterans surprised fans when they suddenly dropped their <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/biffy-clyro-balance-not-symmetry-album-review">soundtrack album ‘Balance, Not Symmetry</a>‘. Since 2018, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/biffy-clyro-told-us-ambitious-plans-record-two-new-albums-year-2291771">the band have been open in their plans to work on a more traditional album (under the name of ‘Opus 8</a>‘) alongside the soundtrack. The year 2020 looks set to be a big one for Biffy, with <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/biffy-clyro-confirm-their-next-album-will-arrive-in-first-half-of-next-year-2556351">the next record set to drop in the first six months before Glasto</a>.</p>
      <p>Having <a href="https://www.nme.com/photos/biffy-clyro-their-explosive-reading-headliner-set-in-pictures-1404536">already headlined Reading &amp; Leeds</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/biffy-clyro-return-isle-wight-festival-2019-review">the Isle Of Wight Festival</a>, Glastonbury is the next big festival they need to top the bill at and conquer. “We’re ready for it, we love Glastonbury, we’d love to do it,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/biffy-clyro-headlining-glastonbury-got-happen-2391314">said frontman Simon Neil back in 2018</a>. “I think the next six months to a year we’re going to be working on our new album, so I don’t think the timing will be right for next year. But it’s got to happen.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/biffy-clyro-call-fleetwood-mac-cheeky-bastards-for-rejecting-glastonbury-slot-over-fee-2567152">Neil also took a dig at Fleetwood Mac’s high pricetag</a>, and again voiced his keenness to headline.</p>
      <p>“Look at Fleetwood Mac,” he said in November 2019. “There’s not enough money for them, those cheeky bastards! It is such a shame isn’t it? It’s not in the spirit of Glastonbury, it’s not about the money. If the Rolling Stones can do it, Kanye did it, U2, and you’re telling me Fleetwood Mac can’t? Fuck it, no way.”</p>
      <p>When asked if Biffy Clyro would be headlining themselves, Simon teased: “That would be telling, wouldn’t it?”</p>

      <h3>What are the bookies’ odds for Glastonbury 2020 headliners?</h3>
      <p>Sky Bet have just released (as of November 11) some new odds for rumoured Glastonbury headliners next year, with Kendrick Lamar the favourite to headline, closely followed by Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney and Aerosmith.</p>
      <p>Check out the latest odds below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Kendrick Lamar 1/2</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Taylor Swift 4/7</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Paul McCartney 8/11</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Aerosmith 9/4</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Foals 4/1</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The 1975 4/1</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fleetwood Mac 5/1</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Arctic Monkeys 11/2</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Queen and Adam Lambert 6/1</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Biffy Clyro 7/1</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recently, high street bookies <a href="https://sports.betway.com/en/sports/evt/4582681">Betway</a> said Foals were one of the early favourites. Like SkyBet, they also singled out Paul McCartney and Fleetwood Mac as potential headliners. </p>
      <p>“Planning for next year’s Glastonbury Festival will already be underway and the Eavis’ will put on something very special for the event’s 50th anniversary,” said Betway’s Alan Alger. “Foals are one of the big early fancies to get a headline spot at just 7/4. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/foals-secret-glastonbury-2019-set-headlining-future-fucking-bangsman-new-album-2519891">Their performance on the Park Stage</a> certainly qualified them to get the nod for the Pyramid and they are one of the leading contenders to headline in 2020.</p>
      <p>“The most likely headliners at this stage are Paul McCartney, who’s just evens to play for the first time since 2004, and Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood Mac would be something really special for Glastonbury given they’ve never headlined before, and they’re very popular in the betting at 5/4.”</p>
      <h3>How many tickets are there for Glastonbury 2020?</h3>
      <p>This year 135,000 punters bought tickets in the general sale, with a total of 203,000 people (including artists, volunteers, and festival workers) onsite. </p>
      <p>Going forward into next summer, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/glastonbury-festival-allowed-to-increase-crowd-capacity-on-one-condition-2454174">a change to Worthy Farm’s licence means that a further 7,000 people will be allowed to go to Glastonbury</a> – on the condition that they all get there by public transport.  The increase will give the festival a total capacity of 210,000.</p>
      <p>In 2019, around two million people registered to buy Glastonbury tickets in total – assuming all of them gave it a try in the sale, just 6.75% of them were lucky enough to bag one. </p>

      <h3>Are there any secret tips to beat the Glastonbury ticket rush?</h3>
      <p>Yup, <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/glastonbury-ticket-buying-tips-tricks-2385330">check out our blog here where we interviewed Glasto ticket buying pros on their secrets and hacks</a>.</p>
      <p>Every seasoned Glastonbury-goer swears by a different method. Some swear that major cities have a harder time in the sale, and trek to the most obscure part of the UK possible. Some wire up their laptops to super-charged internet and manically turn off every other device in the house, while others take the opposite approach and juggle ten iPads, four mobiles, and two computers at the same time. But the real secret, according to organisers, is far simpler than that – be patient, be prepared, and note down all the relevant details to avoid any last minute panic. </p>
      <p>“Make sure you have all your registration details (including postcodes) ready and checked in advance, that there are sufficient cleared funds on the card you intend to use to book, and that you know all the security information for that card,” <a href="https://glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/2019-ticket-sale-faq/">they advise.</a> If you’re trying for any of your mates, it’s also worth noting their postcodes and registration numbers down, to avoid the worst case scenario – messing up and entering in the wrong details on the final page. </p>

      <p>Once you reach the booking page,  you have exactly 6 minutes to complete the transaction. You’re a lot more likely to succeed if you don’t make any mistakes at this stage.</p>
      <p>Glastonbury organisers also recommend a bit of determination. “Be persistent and patient – there are likely to be more people trying to buy tickets than there are tickets available, so inevitably not everyone will be able to book tickets, but the longer you try the more likely you are to get a ticket.” </p>
      <p>Other than that, all you can really do is keep your fingers firmly crossed.</p>
      <p>And with that, bring on Glastonbury 2020!</p>
