      <h1>How to add the Google Play Store to your 2019 Amazon Fire 10 HD tablet</h1>

      <p>The very first thing I did with my <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUL7Jg">new Amazon Fire HD 10</a> was to install the Google Play Store.</p>
      <p>I love Amazon's bargain tablets, they are a cheap Android device with heavy integration into Amazon. I ignore the shopping and love the Prime Video. Installing Google Play store gives me access to all the stuff Amazon doesn't provide: Gmail, Chrome and thousands of Android apps.</p>

      <p>The process is very simple and only requires you download and permit four .apks to install (all files come from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/">APK Mirror</a>):</p>
      <p>
        <i>You will have to permit the files to be installed as Amazon doesn't love Google as a source.</i>
      </p>
      <p>• First: <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-account-manager/google-account-manager-7-1-2-release/google-account-manager-7-1-2-android-apk-download/">Google Account Manager 7.1.2 (Android 6.0+)</a></p>
      <p>• Second: <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-services-framework/google-services-framework-9-release/google-services-framework-9-android-apk-download/">Google Services Framework 9 (Android 9.0+)</a></p>
      <p>• Third: <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-services/google-play-services-19-6-29-release/google-play-services-19-6-29-100300-278422107-android-apk-download/">Google Play services 19.6.29 (100300-278422107) (100300)</a></p>
      <p>• Fourth: <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-store/google-play-store-17-5-18-release/google-play-store-17-5-18-all-0-pr-280467566-android-apk-download/">Google Play Store 17.5.18-all [0] [PR] 280467566 (nodpi) (Android 4.1+)</a></p>
      <p>This is my fourth such Amazon tablet and I have never had an issue with Amazon trying to block this activity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2CUL7Jg">The new Amazon Fire HD 10</a> has some decent CPU and memory upgrades. I am trying it out this week and will review soon. Thus far, its the same as the old one but faster and with a slightly better screen.</p>
