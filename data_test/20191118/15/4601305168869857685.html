      <h1>Joe Biden, failing to support legalized marijuana, still thinks it may be a gateway drug</h1>

      <p>Joe Biden, claiming to represent whichever generation claims him as their own, says that we STILL need to determine if marijuana is a gateway drug.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/18/joe-biden-marijuana-gateway-drug-legalization/">Washington Post</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14.<br/><br/>This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a “gateway drug” that can lead users to harsher substances.<br/><br/>“The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Biden said. “It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”</blockquote>
