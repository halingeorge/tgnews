      <h1>Explosive prose: translation of Pakistani satire hits bookstores</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:18:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:18</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Featuring bumbling generals, assassination plots, and homosexual romance, Pakistani military satire “A Case of Exploding Mangoes” by Mohammed Hanif has finally been released in the country’s official language Urdu – even as the army tightens its grip on freedom of expression.</p>
      <p>The former fighter pilot turned journalist, novelist and librettist is best known for the 2008 novel which chronicles the final days of hardline dictator General Zia-ul-Haq’s rule and the myriad conspiracies behind the plane crash that killed him in 1988.</p>
      <p>Zia, a pious and far-right dictator in real life, is portrayed by Hanif as a paranoid buffoon backing the Afghan jihad against the Soviets while battling a case of rectal worms.</p>
      <p>Although <i>Mangoes</i> is generously salted with heavy doses of humour, the book also unleashes harsh criticism at Pakistan’s military establishment.</p>
      <p>In the book, the military relies on torture, extrajudicial murder, and covertly supports a jihadist insurgency to pursue its goals – accusations made by rights activists in real life, but which the military denies, and rarely allows to be repeated by the Pakistani press.</p>
      <p>“I love the army. Some of my best friends have died in combat. I have nothing against the institution,” explains the 55-year-old, whose own years in uniform provided much of the granular details of military life featured in the book.</p>
      <p>“But if the military does something wrong, if they get involved in politics, if they disappear people, then I have to write about it,” he adds.</p>
      <p>While <i>Mangoes</i> was set in Zia’s Pakistan, it was first released in English – the language of Pakistan’s small, educated elite – during the violent rule of another military dictator, Pervez Musharraf.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Backlash’</b>
      </p>
      <p>It coincided with Hanif’s return to Pakistan after spending nearly 12 years in London with the BBC.</p>
      <p>“Some of my journalist friends were scared for me,” he recalled.</p>
      <p>“I was lucky because 2008 was a particularly bad year in Pakistan with a lot of bloodshed,” including the onset of the Pakistani Taliban insurgency, which likely “distracted” potential censors, he tells AFP.</p>
      <p>Internationally, the novel earned glowing reviews and was longlisted for the Booker Prize, with critics comparing Hanif to famous satire writers Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut.</p>
      <p>Despite the widespread praise, more than a decade passed before the novel was translated into Urdu – Pakistan’s other official language, and more widely spoken by the masses.</p>
      <p>Works written in English have a narrower, elite audience and so often have greater leeway, while Urdu content tends to be more carefully censored.</p>
      <p>According to Hanif, a publisher “sat” on the Urdu translation of the book for years, citing potential repercussions.</p>
      <p>But “the time for a backlash has passed”, said the book’s publisher Hoori Noorani.</p>
      <p>“The book had been translated into all major languages of the world. Even though it is a satire and humour can be subversive, it depicts a dark part of our history.”</p>
      <p>Even so, the book’s Urdu release last month comes as authorities have increasingly cracked down on all forms of dissent.</p>
      <p>Journalists have complained of the worst censorship since Zia’s time, while opposition leaders are rounded up in a controversial anti-corruption campaign.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Censorship and fear</b>
      </p>
      <p>As such, the Urdu edition of “Mangoes” is “very timely,” says Harris Khalique, a poet and rights activist.</p>
      <p>“Thirty years after the assassination of Zia, writers and journalists are experiencing similar pressures,” he adds.</p>
      <p>Noorani is hoping to sell a few thousand copies – a decent number in a country with low literacy rates and an ongoing economic downturn that he says has forced some people to “choose between buying a book or food”.</p>
      <p>Since <i>Mangoes</i> success, Hanif has gone on to publish two more novels: <i>Our Lady of Alice Bhatti</i> – the story of a nurse from the Christian minority fighting against patriarchy – and last year’s <i>Red Birds</i>, which focuses on war and refugees.</p>
      <p>Hanif has also helped co-create a much anticipated opera about the late Pakistani Prime Minister Benzair Bhutto, all while pumping out regular op-eds for the New York Times.</p>
      <p>As a columnist, Hanif has established himself as one of the premier voices on all things Pakistan – from the gender politics of making roti to criticism of the army, which saw one of his columns replaced with a blank page in the Pakistani print edition of the paper in 2017.</p>
      <p>He admits there are limits – saying his 2013 book about human rights abuses in restive Balochistan province “would be difficult to write now”.</p>
      <p>Like most in Pakistani media, he admits to “self-censoring” mostly out of fear of putting his family at risk.</p>
      <p>“I have pushed the boundaries,” says Hanif. “But I’m now more careful than I’ve ever been in my life.”</p>
