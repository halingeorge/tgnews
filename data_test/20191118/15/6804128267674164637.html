      <h1>Arsenal fans fume at ex-Leeds star for what he did to Nicolas Pepe during Ivory Coast match</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal winger played in the Ivory Coast's win over Niger</h2>

      <p>Nicolas Pepe put his <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> struggles to one side to help Ivory Coast beat Niger in their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Elephants were 1-0 winners in Abidjan thanks to a second half penalty from AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie.</p>
      <p>The spot-kick was the second of the game for the home side, after former Leeds United and Bournemouth winger Max Gradel missed a penalty in the first half.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/all-about/nicolas-pepe">Pepe</a> won the penalty and asked to take it, but Gradel won the argument with his teammate. The 31-year-old then saw his effort saved by Niger goalkeeper Kassaly Daouda.</p>
      <p>Gradel saw his blushes spared with Kessie's eventual winner, but some Arsenal fans took to social media to voice their anger that Pepe wasn't rewarded for winning the penalty.</p>
      <p>One wrote: 'Who made Max Gradel captain of a team and allowed him to take a pen over Pepe deadball King? Disgrace.'</p>

      <p>Pepe has struggled for consistency since his club record £72m transfer from Lille in the summer, and Arsenal head coach Unai Emery has left the 24-year-old out of the line-up for the last two Premier League matches.</p>
      <p>Emery has admitted that Pepe’s adaptation to English football has been slower than he anticipated and claims the winger must step up his game if he is to win his place back in the side.</p>
      <p>"He just needs time, and to be demanding of himself," Emery told Sky Sports after the 1-1 draw against Wolves.</p>
      <p>"We are with him, working individually with him and showing him videos of where he can improve.</p>
      <p>"The intensity of the game and the opponents in England demands a lot of you. He has to adapt to that, and we have to help him so that he can keep taking steps forward.</p>
      <p>"His process of adapting to the team is positive, but a little slower than what we wanted. We have to be patient as well as demanding and what’s more, we have to ensure that he takes responsibility himself.</p>
      <p>"He is not quite at the level yet to be able to play in every game. I believe, and I have always believed, that he needs to play in order to reach that level, but obviously there are also games when other players deserve to play. I use the players who I think are going to help us most in each moment.</p>
      <p>"But we bought Pepe knowing that the first year would be difficult, that it would be a year of adaptation. We want that to happen as quickly as possible, but we are seeing that we have to have patience."</p>
