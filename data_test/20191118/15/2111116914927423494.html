      <p>We may have got our first look at the upcoming <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-ps5-controller-release-date-news-and-confirmed-features">PS5 controller</a>, thanks to yet another leaked Sony patent.</p>
      <p>Published by the Japanese patent office (via VGC), the Sony Interactive Entertainment patent lays out designs for a new controller that looks very similar to the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/controllers/dualshock-4-controller-1157615/review">DualShock 4</a> . </p>
      <p>However, there are a few subtle differences from the DualShock 4 that have piqued our interest.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>What's changed?</h4>

      <p>Compared the the DualShock 4, the new controller design has some key differences. For a start, the potential PS5 controller seems to have a slightly chunkier design, built-in microphone, larger triggers, no light bar and smaller sticks. It also seems the DualShock 4's micro USB port has been replaced by a smaller USB-C port, which is placed on the top rather than the bottom of the controller.</p>
      <p>The lack of light bar does make us question how the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/ps5-release-date-news-and-features-1213409">PS5</a> would track the controller via when it comes to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/playstation-vr-1235379/review">PSVR</a> and PS Camera games. Usually this is done via the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/gaming-accessories/playstation-4-camera-1202008/review">PS Camera</a>, so we're hoping the console will have a different means of tracking the controller otherwise compatibility will suffer. Unless, of course, Sony is gearing up to move solely onto <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/playstation-vr-2-release-date-price-news-and-rumors">PSVR 2</a>. However, this doesn't seem likely as Sony has promised the PS5 will be backwards compatible with PSVR.</p>
      <p>It also looks like the stereo headset jack and extension port at the bottom of the headset has been replaced by two larger circular ports. We think these will still be for plugging in headsets, but the two jacks could be headphone and microphone slots respectively, to increase compatibility with headsets. There's also a rectangular design that seems to wrap around the headset, which is potentially for compatibility with a charging dock. Again, this is all speculation on our part. </p>
      <h4>Pairing up with what we know</h4>

      <p>The design we've seen lines up with nearly everything we know about the PS5 controller so far. We already know the controller will include haptic feedback to replace the DualShock 4's rumble technology. </p>
      <p>While rumble technology seen the PS4 controller vibrating intensely during particular in-game events, it wasn't particularly fine-tuned to the player's experience. Haptic feedback simulates touch, meaning the controller will output vibrations or movements to replicate a real-life touch experience. This aims to improve the controller's feedback and therefore player's immersion. </p>
      <p>The PS5 controller will also feature adaptive triggers which Sony says have "been incorporated into the trigger buttons (L2/R2)". These adaptive triggers will allow developers to program the resistance of the triggers to simulate actions more accurately. This explains why the triggers are considerably larger than that of the DualShock 4.</p>
      <p>The PS5 controller is expected to launch alongside the PS5 in late 2020.</p>
