      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Olivia Colman says it is "harder" to play Queen Elizabeth II than it was to portray 18th century monarch Queen Anne.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old British actress appeared with <i>The Crown</i> co-stars Tobias Menzies and Helena Bonham Carter<a href="https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1196423614955950080"> on Monday's episode</a> of <i>Today</i>, where she compared her roles as Elizabeth on <i>The Crown</i> and Anne in <i>The Favourite</i>.</p>
      <p>"[Elizabeth has] been a harder job to do than Queen Anne, mainly because I am quite emotional," Colman, who won an Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Anne in <i>The Favourite</i>, said.</p>
      <p>Bonham Carter, who portrays Princess Margaret on <i>The Crown</i>, pointed out that "no one knows what Queen Anne was like anyway."</p>
      <p>"Exactly," Colman agreed. "[With Elizabeth], obviously, everyone is a critic. Everyone knows what she looks like. Everyone's heard her. Everyone has seen her walking."</p>
      <p><i>The Crown </i>Season 3, Episode 3 explored Elizabeth's perceived lack of emotion, in the context of the Aberfan mining tragedy. Colman mentioned that Elizabeth is said to be more emotive in private.</p>
      <p>"Behind closed doors, apparently, she's an absolute hoot," Colman said. "She's a great mimic, she's a great laugh."</p>
      <p>Season 3 premiered Friday on Netflix. Colman, Menzies and Bonham Carter replace Claire Foy, Matt Smith and Vanessa Kirby, who played younger versions of Elizabeth, Prince Philip and Margaret in Seasons 1 and 2.</p>
      <p>"We've been employed because we're older and battered," Bonham Carter jokingly said.</p>
      <p><i>The Crown </i>follows Elizabeth's reign throughout the decades, which each season progressing the timeline by some years.<a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/10/15/The-Crown-Olivia-Colmans-era-begins-in-Season-3-poster/6861571157965/"> Season 4 will feature</a> Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher and Emma Corrin as the future Princess Diana.</p>
