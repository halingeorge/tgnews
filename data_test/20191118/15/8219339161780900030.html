      <h1>Apple subsidiary Claris launches beta of Connect automation platform for third-party apps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:00:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Claris, the Apple subsidiary formerly known as FileMaker, has announced the beta launch of its new <a href="http://www.claris.com/r/join-claris-connect.html">Claris Connect platform</a>. According to the company, Claris Connect allows powerful integration with third-party apps and services to help businesses automate workflows.</p>
      <p>Claris Connect is an integration and workflows service that uses a graphical interface, allowing developers to create workflows of different complexity levels by simply stitching together third-party services. That means there’s no need for custom coding, with Claris Connect automatically handling the back-end configuration across the third-party applications.</p>
      <p>Here’s how Claris describes the new platform:</p>
      <blockquote>Designed to tap into the ever-expanding PaaS market, Claris Connect removes the need for custom coding and automatically handles authentication, authorization, monitoring, versioning, error handling and much more. This powerful event-driven workflow automation tool handles all of the backend data infrastructure for Claris developers, and features seamless connections and experiences across both cloud and on-premise apps. With an easy-to-use graphical interface, developers can create workflows as simple or as complex as their needs, simply by stitching together third party services.</blockquote>
      <p>Claris explains that the launch of the Connect platform is the result of its <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/06/apple-filemaker-claris/">acquisition of Stamplay</a>, which focused on helping businesses integrate third-party cloud services into their applications. With the new Connect platform, Claris is essentially bringing the unique features of Stamplay directly to the FileMaker and Claris platform itself.</p>
      <p>FileMaker <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/06/apple-filemaker-claris/">rebranded as Claris back in August</a> and outlined an ambitious growth plan. Claris promised that the core FileMaker product would remain the same amidst the rebrand, but that the company was looking to invest heavily in areas like augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>
