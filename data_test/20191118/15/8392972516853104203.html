      <p>ITV viewers have branded the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/adele-roberts-completes-im-a-celebrity-lineup/">line-up</a> "disappointing" and accused the show of "scraping the barrel" for the camp this year.</p>
      <p>After watching the opening episode of the new series, which aired last night (17.11.19), some viewers on Twitter even said they thought it was the "worst line-up ever".</p>

      <p>Other admitted they thought ITV would have trouble topping the 2018 line-up, which included The Chase's Anne Hegerty, football manager Harry Redknapp and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-dont-like-emily-atacks-new-hair/">new Extra Camp host Emily Atack</a>.</p>
      <p>One wrote on Twitter: "This has to be the worst #ImACeleb line-up, #scrapingthebarell, apart from #ianwright."</p>

      <p>Another said: "Has to be said, this is a pretty poor line-up #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "Apart from Haskell, Wright and possibly Kate Garraway, it's the worst line up ever."</p>
      <aside>Seriously the worst line-up of so-called celebs I've ever seen.</aside>
      <p>Someone else wrote: "Best line-up ever? No! You will never beat last year's!</p>
      <p>"The best line-up is still last year's #ImACeleb," echoed a fifth.</p>
      <p>"Seriously the worst line-up of so-called celebs I've ever seen," tweeted another, who added: "Truly disappointed! #ImACeleb."</p>

      <p>But not everyone was disappointed with this year's celebrities.</p>

      <p>"Loving the show so far @antanddec, it's going to be an amazing series and the line-up is brilliant this year as well xx."</p>
