      <p>The Uthamapalayam police arrested eight persons in connection with the murder of a youth on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In a case of suspicious death reported under the Uthamalapalayam police station on November 14, the body of a youth identified by the police as K. Sivagurunathan, 26, of Mariamman Kovil Street, Cumbum, was found floating in the Mullai river near Kokilapuram near Uthamapalayam.</p>
      <p>It was found that there were pending theft cases in multiple stations in the district against the victim.</p>
      <p>The police said that the body had multiple cut injuries and hence investigation was started based on a complaint by the father of the victim Kandasamy.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the police arrested eight men, Asai, Ganesan, R. Palanikumar, Vignesh, Muthupandi, Palanikumar, Manikandan and Premkumar for allegedly murdering the youth.</p>
      <p>“The youth had been a part of the gang that was involved in various crimes and of late had reformed and was away from the gang activities. On November 14, the gang had allegedly taken him to Vettukadu forest area near Lower Camp and they all had consumed alcohol, after which the gang hacked the youth in multiple places, murdered him and threw the body in the river,” said a police officer investigating the case.</p>
