        <b>Honda claimed a one-two victory in the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>, but it probably wasn't the two drivers they were expecting. <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> climbed the top step while <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> put the gas down in the final 500 meters of the race against <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton's</a> <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> and proved the Honda engine has the power in a straight fight. </b>

      <p>Mattia Binotto says the Formula 1 world shouldn't be surprised by their speed. Earlier in the season, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> driver Verstappen claimed that <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> are cheating. Last weekend, Sebastian Vettel got one back on his rival by saying the Honda engine looks suspicious. </p>

      <p>Mattia Binotto, unlike one of his drivers, takes it seriously and refuses to point the finger.</p>
      <p><i>"I cannot explain what they are doing, I only know how we work,"</i> he told the Italian media on Interlagos. "<i>Their speed was high, but to say it is surprising would not be fair."</i></p>
