      <h1>Baba is You Will Get Community Level Creation Next Year</h1>

      <p>I’m so bad at<i> Baba is You</i> that even the sight of a rabbit is enough to have me break out in a cold sweat, but it seems that now it’s about to get even harder. In a tweet over the weekend, developer Hempuli Oy confirmed that fans of the game will soon be able to create and share their own levels.</p>

      <p>The tweet reads that “<i>Baba is You</i> will get a level editor in 2020, and it’ll feature online level-sharing.” More details are on the way, but the developer did confirm that you’ll have access to fan-created levels no matter what platform or storefront (the game is available on both Steam and itch.io, as well as the Nintendo Switch) you’re playing on.</p>
      <p>Given that I found the original version of the game tough as nails, I’m a little scared to find out what monstrosities the wider community can cook up.</p>
