      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Kanye-west">Kanye West</a> is just a few weeks past the release of his latest album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Kanye-west/Jesus-is-king"><i>Jesus is King</i></a>, but he’s already plotting more material. In addition to his <a href="https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-announces-a-new-album-jesus-is-born-dropping-on-christmas">Sunday Service album, <i>Jesus is Born</i></a>, dropping on Christmas, the rapper is set to stage his first ever opera later this month. Titled <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, it will take place on Nov. 24 at Los Angeles' Hollywood Bowl:</p>

      <p>Performance artist Vanessa Beecroft is set to direct, and Kanye’s Sunday Service choir will contribute music. A short show description was later released. “Set in the 6th Century BC, the Book of Daniel recounts Nebuchadnezzar’s transition from wicked, imperious, self-declared ruler to a true believer who finds salvation in his faith,” it reveals.</p>
      <p>Not much else is known about the project. It takes its title from the famous Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II, who is prominently featured in The Bible. West compared himself to the king in a recent interview with Zane Lowe.</p>
      <p>“[God] is saying, Let me take this Nebuchadnezzar-type character—Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon. And he looked at his entire kingdom and said, ‘I did this.’ And God said, ‘Oh, for real? You did this?’ Sounds kind of similar, right? I’m standing on the tip of the mountain talking about <i>Yeezus</i>. Saying, ‘I did this!’ That I’m a God!“ he said. "And I would—I could talk to Jesus at the end of my show. I had (laughs) a guy dressed up as Jesus, at the end of my show.”</p>
      <p>He also claimed that the two share mental health issues. “Nebuchadnezzar was diagnosed with bipolar disorder,“ he said. "and he was still king.”</p>
      <p>The opera appears to be the the latest example of Kanye’s pivot to religious themes in his music. He’s spoken about <a href="https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-wants-to-convert-fans-with-his-new-religious-music">no longer releasing secular music</a>, and recently brought his Sunday Service series to <a href="https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-will-reportedly-bring-his-sunday-service-series-to-celebrity-pastor-joel-osteen-s-church">televangelist Joel Osteen’s mega-church</a> in Houston.</p>
