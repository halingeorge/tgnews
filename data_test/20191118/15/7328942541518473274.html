      <h1>7 Heart-Melting Robots That Hopefully Won't End Humanity</h1>
      <h2>Skynet? More like cutenet.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:31:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Young</a></address>
      <p>While there might be a <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/ex-google-worker-fears-mass-atrocities-caused-by-killer-robots">real Skynet-style danger</a> surrounding unchecked robotics and AI, many developers are striving to make robots user-friendly by simply... making them look friendly.</p>
      <p>Have a look at these 7 incredibly cute robots that wouldn't be out of place in the Star Wars universe — a place where robots are designed to be so cute they sell a crazy amount of toys.</p>

      <h3>1. A robot bike rider</h3>
      <p>Look at this little fella go. The Primer V2 robot, developed by Japanese roboticist Masahiko Yamaguchi, is able to ride a bicycle in much the same way as a human.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/awwbots/comments/9ug7aa/bike_riding_robot_can_cycle_balance_steer_and/">Bike riding robot can cycle, balance, steer, and correct itself</a><br/>from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwbots">r/awwbots</a></blockquote>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.designboom.com/technology/bicycle-riding-robot/"><i>Design Boom</i></a> explains, Yamaguchi attached a gyroscope to the robot, which allows it to calculate how sharply it needs to turn in order to compensate and remain balanced.</p>
      <p>Yamaguchi also built a control unit, inserted into the robot's backpack, to ensure high processing speed. Watch out paperboys, this robot might be after your job — we're joking, digital media already saw to that.</p>
      <h3>2. A dancing bot army</h3>
      <p>No, we're not talking online bots spreading dancing memes and fake news throughout the web. We mean actual dancing robots.</p>
      <p>Back in 2017, a Chinese toy manufacturer, WL Intelligent Technology broke a world record with its $230 Dobi robots. The company lined up 1,069 of them in Guangzhou, China, in order to do a synchronized robo-dance along to a techno beat.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This was part of a successful <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2017/8/video-watch-1-069-dancing-robots-break-world-record-487675">Guinness World Record</a> attempt at having the highest amount of robots dancing simultaneously. The words "robot" and "army" used in the same sentence still make us lose sleep though.</p>
      <h3>3. A sun-chasing plant-carrying robot</h3>
      <p>Plants are "heliotropic," meaning they move towards sunlight in order to catch the sun rays that are vital to their survival.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, they can't uproot themselves and move towards the light when they've been completely covered from the sun.</p>
      <p>That's where the aptly named Sun Tianqi, an AI, neuroscience, and robotics researcher, and founder of <a href="https://www.vincross.com/">Vincross</a>, comes in.</p>
      <figure>
        <video src="https://forum.vincross.com/uploads/default/original/1X/f46ff5c99da69c6685868fc04be91947ffcee668.gif" autoplay="" loop=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>As Tianqi says in a <a href="https://forum.vincross.com/t/remaking-sharing-human-technology-with-plants-with-hexa/596">blog post</a> about his sun-searching droid, "with a robotic rover base, plants can experience mobility and interaction."</p>
      <p>Specifically, this robot moves towards sunlight in order to keep the plant that is attached to it healthy.</p>
      <p>"I do hope that this project can bring some inspiration to the relationship between technology and natural default settings," Tianqi explains.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Not only can the robot, called Hexa, move towards sunlight when needed, it also performs a cute little dance — or has a tantrum — when it needs to be watered.</p>
      <p>The robot can also play with humans and move into the shade when it needs to cool off.</p>
      <h3>4. A giant leap for robotkind</h3>
      <p>SALTO, a leaping robot designed by UC Berkeley, stands for saltatorial locomotion terrain obstacles — it also means jump in Spanish.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvIk39rkkiU" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The robot can <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/tiny-robot-scales-walls-spider-man-style-agility">jump higher than most humans</a> in a single jump. However, the robot's ability to take multiple vertical jumps — in Super Mario style — makes it an incredible piece of robotics.</p>
      <p>SALTO's jumping ability allows it to jump at 1.75 meters per second. That's more than a bullfrog's ability to jump 1.71 meters per second.</p>
      <h3>5. The world's cutest robot?</h3>
      <p>Robotics company Anki realized there was a gap in the market for an actual, real-life R2-D2. The company created an adorable helpful sidekick robot to help you with daily tasks.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qy2Z2TWAt6A" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Almost <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anki/vector-by-anki-a-giant-roll-forward-for-robot-kind">$2 million in backing</a> for Vector makes it the most funded robotics project ever.</p>
      <p>Inside the robot's tiny frame is an impressive array of technology. It contains a Qualcomm 200 Platform, an HD camera with 120 Ultra Wide FOV, Beamforming Four-Microphone Array, Infrared Laser Scanner, 6-Axis IMU, and a High-Res Color IPS Display.</p>
      <h3>6. Zero-gravity robot</h3>
      <p>When the cynics amongst us think of robots in spacecraft, we think about Stanley Kubrick's <i>2001: A Space Odyssey, </i>in which a robot named HAL goes rogue and starts killing the space explorers it's meant to be protecting.</p>
      <p>Int-Ball doesn't have quite so much power thankfully. The cute floating space ball is the International Space Station's resident robot drone. It is essentially a floating camera that can be remote-controlled from Earth. </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojFNo19HYSo" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) says the robot drone can move freely through autonomous flight and can record video footage from any angle.</p>
      <p>In the future, JAXA developers want the Int-Ball to be able to check supplies and even help with any problems that might arise in space. The Int-Ball weighs 1kg (2.2lbs), has a diameter of 15cm, and has 12 propellers, according to<i> </i><a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/15/national/jaxa-tests-grapefruit-sized-video-drone-aboard-iss/#.WWylU9PytmA"><i>The Japan Times</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The fact that it looks like a character from a Pixar movie also makes it psychologically pleasing to astronauts who have to spend a long time away from home.</p>
      <h3>7. Last but not least... the robot butt wiggle</h3>
      <p>This final robot bears a striking resemblance to Boston Dynamics' Spot robot. Spot has itself drawn comparisons to the menacing killer robot in Black Mirror episode Metalhead.</p>
      <p>The best way to make a robot seem less menacing? Make it... twerk?</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/awwbots/comments/dty96v/robot_butt_wiggle/">Robot butt wiggle</a><br/>from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwbots">r/awwbots</a></blockquote>
      <p>While it might not have a real practical purpose, at least it serves to show that robots don't have to be scary — and can even clown around.</p>
      <p>It's the programmers and the people behind the robots that count. An important lesson perhaps.</p>
      <p>Is this robot secretly being controlled by an AI that wants to give us a false sense of security before the eventual robot uprising?</p>
      <p>Only time will tell.</p>
