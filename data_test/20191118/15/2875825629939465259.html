      <h1>International Rules to return in 2020 and 2022</h1>
      <h2>The games have been provisionally pencilled in for November 15 and 21</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:14:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/pat-nolan/" target="_blank">Pat Nolan</a></address>
      <p>The International Rules is to return next year with a two-Test series in Ireland.</p>
      <p>The games have been provisionally pencilled in for November 15 and 21, the latter date coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday atrocities at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/croke-park">Croke Park.</a></p>
      <p>The series will then resume in 2022 in Australia, when it will also be played over two Tests.</p>
      <p>The last time the hybrid games were contested was in 2017, when Australia came out on top over the course of two games down under. Previous to that, Ireland won a one-off Test at Croke Park in 2015.</p>

      <p>The AFL have confirmed that their team and management will hold a training camp in New York en route to Ireland next year, similar to 2015.</p>
      <p>GAA director general Tom Ryan commented: “We are pleased to announce the return of the International Rules Series in 2020 and look forward to reconnecting with our friends and colleagues in the AFL, both on and off the field.</p>
      <p>"The series offers our players the chance to wear the green jersey and represent Ireland and it also provides them with an opportunity to pit themselves against the best from another code while showcasing the best skills of Gaelic football.”</p>
      <p>With the AFL having been criticised for fielding shadow selections in the past, its General Manager Football Operations Steve Hocking said that it the team will be drawn from next year’s All- Australian selection, their equivalent of the GAA’s All Stars.</p>
      <p>“We want to take the best of the best to the two-Test series in Ireland next year and our All-Australian players will be the first players selected,” he said.</p>
      <p>The International Rules was first played in 1984 and there were a further three series up to 1990 before it was parked for eight years amid disappointing attendances, particularly in Australia.</p>
      <p>However, it really took off when it was rebooted in 1998 and drew huge crowds both in Australia and Ireland, where it sold out Croke Park on occasions, before violence married the series in 2005 and ‘06, leading to it being sidelined once again in 2007.</p>
      <p>It has been played intermittently since without capturing the public imagination as it did in the 1998-2006 period.</p>
