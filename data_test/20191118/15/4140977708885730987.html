            <b>SPA Vs ROM Dream11 : Table toppers Spain look to wrap up their thriving qualification process with another win when they take on a lacklustre Romania side.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Romania needed a win in their last outing against Sweden to make today’s contest against Spain meaningful, but unfortunately for the side, a 2-0 defeat in that clash meant today’s encounter is an inconsequential one for both sides. Where Spain have assured themselves of not only qualification to Euro 2020 but of first place in Group F as well, Romania’s aspirations of making it into the showpiece have come to an end.</p>
          <p>The only team to have enjoyed an unbeaten campaign in Group F of the Euro 2020 qualifying process, for Spain this journey could prove to be a defining moment in their bid of revitalising their sojourn in the footballing fraternity. Followed up by a dismal outing in the world cup, the side went for a complete overhaul in a bid to stop being underachievers, roping in a slew of new players as the side looked to embark on a successful sortie on the global stage.</p>

                <p>They come into today’s encounter having tasted consummate success against Malta the last time around, a 7-0 routing which was a testament to the massive strides the team has had over the course of this qualification round. And when they take on Romania today in their culminating group stage match, the Spanish will be looking to revel their rapturous supporters in a performance reminiscent of the last match.</p>
                <p>For Romania on the other hand, although a win won’t change the shape of the group, a favourable result for them will see them set a statement and lay down the marker for their future travails. Things will be extremely jittery for them today but against a Spain side which is bound to shuffle its side around and give a slew of their lesser played players chances in this one, Romania will be well aware that reslliance and resolve could end up going a long way in asserting a win for them today.</p>

                            <h3>SPA vs ROM Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>If Romania are going to have any chance of emerging winners from this clash, they’ll be requiring their man between the sticks, Ciprian Tatarusanu to be at the pinnacles of his traits. The shot stopper is going to be lambasted by a plethora of shots at him and although the likelihood of him keeping all of them out is extremely unlikely, the number of saves he’s bound to make warrants his selection in our setup.</p>
                            <h3>SPA vs ROM Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>With the home side having let in a mere 5 goals in their 9 matches till now in, there is a solid chance of the side keeping yet another cleansheet today as well. They conceded when these sides had met previously in a 2-1 win for the side but at home we envisage them to parry away the attacking plays Romania will craft today.</p>
                            <p>It sees us move in for the entire backline from Spain for this one with the players not only capable of shunning out Romania from scoring but being of attacking persuasion themselves. Both the fullbacks in the form of Jose Gaya and Dani Carvajal are going to be persistently marauding their way down the park while captain Sergio Ramos will be handed over penalty duty, seeing the trio offer pristine value for this clash.</p>
                            <p>CB Inigo Martinez enters the fray of our side as well from the unit to complete this formation of our Dream 11 side.</p>
                            <h3>SPA vs ROM Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Fabain Ruiz is our only player from Spain while from Romania we are venturing in with the selection of the duo of Nicolae Stanciu and Ianis Hagi. If the visiting unit are going to have any chance of scoring today, these two will be need to move in tandem and indulge us in a tenacious display, one which is able to traverse past Spain’s well disciplined defence.</p>
                            <h3>SPA vs ROM Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>A change of the playing 11 from the home side will work favourably for Mikel Oyarzabal who’ll be imbedded in the team for the clash, seeing us make him an instant choice for today’s pertaining tie. The player will see a hoard of chances lie down at his feet, ones which will accord him an exceptional chance to not only fill his shoes but make a bid for an escalated role in the side’s upcoming sojourns.</p>
                            <p>Gerard Moreno is also brought in by us while from the other side we are wrapping up our side with the selection of George Puscas, their most astute and articulate goal scorer who’ll be looking to use his penchant far finding the goal today as well.</p>
                            <h3>SPA vs ROM Dream11 Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Mikel has been made our captain for the impending fixture while Ramos will be our vice-captain.</p>
