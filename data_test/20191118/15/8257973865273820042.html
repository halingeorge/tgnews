      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- A stork that escaped from a British zoo in early November was captured by a bird watcher more than 100 miles away from the facility.</p>
      <p>Daisy the female stork escaped in early November from the Wild Zoological Park in Stourbridge, England, and was spotted late last week perched on the Tourist Information Center in Burnham-on-Sea, more than 100 miles away from the zoo.</p>
      <p>Bird watcher Graham Hall<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=733475090500624&amp;set=a.132921287222677&amp;type=3"> captured</a> Daisy on Sunday and loaded the bird into his car for transport to Secret World Wildlife Rescue in East Huntspill.</p>
      <p>The animal rescue said Daisy is being cared for by staff until her handler can retrieve her.</p>
      <p>"Daisy is a new trainee in the U.K.'s biggest free flight birds show, along with parrots, eagles, cranes, storks, marabous, owls, vultures and many more." Secret World Wildlife Rescue spokeswoman Marlies Hebdon <a href="https://www.burnham-on-sea.com/news/white-stork-captured-on-somerset-levels-after-escaping-from-midlands/">told Burnham-on-Sea.com.</a></p>
      <p>"She's not clipped or caged. She's a free flying bird new to the team, inexperienced flyer and has gotten caught up in wind during a training session and then lost," Hebdon said.</p>
