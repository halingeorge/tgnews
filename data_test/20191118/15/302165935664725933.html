      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 18 — Wall Street stocks mostly dipped early today as fresh skepticism over US-China trade talks weighed on hopes for a near-term resolution to the grinding conflict.</p>
      <p>Analysts cited reports that Chinese officials are intent on staking a “phase one” US-China trade deal on the removal of some tariffs, a condition opposed by the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>About 35 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 28,014.10, up less than 0.1 per cent.</p>
      <p>The broad-based S&amp;P 500 had shed 0.1 per cent at 3,116.23, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.3 per cent to 8,518.12.</p>
      <p>Major US indices ended last week at all-time highs, due in part to optimism over US-China trade talks. Shifting sentiment on the trade conflict has influenced market moves for more than a year.</p>
      <p>This week’s calendar includes housing economic data and minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting, as well as an array of earnings from retailers, including Macy’s and Target.</p>
      <p>Among individual companies, beauty products giant Coty jumped 3.7 per cent after announcing a deal to pay US$600 million (RM2.4 billion) for a majority stake in Kylie Jenner’s cosmetics and skincare company.</p>
      <p>HP dropped 1.0 per cent as it rejected a US$33 billion bid from Xerox, saying that it “significantly undervalues” the company but signaling that it was open to a potential deal down the road. Xerox fell 0.6 per cent. — AFP</p>
