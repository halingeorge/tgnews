      <p>The traditional scarf of Assam which is known as ‘Gamosa’ symbolizes the rich culture and diversity got the Geographical Indication (GI) tag.</p>
      <p>GI tag is used on certain products, identifies agricultural, natural or manufactured goods with unique features.</p>
      <p>In the 124<sup>th</sup> Geographical Indications Journal featured traditional scarf – Gamosa with the GI tag. It said, “The Gamosa is a traditional textile and a symbol of Assamese culture.”</p>
      <p>The application for Gamosa was made by the Institute of Handicraft Craft Development in Golaghat.</p>
      <p>Not only Gamosa, but Chokuwa rice of Assam has also received the GI tag. This rice is used in social and religious ceremonies.</p>
      <p>It is mentioned that both products will boost the market economy. GI tag ensures only authorized users get to use the product name.</p>
      <p>Earlier, by the government of India’s Intellectual Property India (IPI) body,  Assam’s staple food Boka Chaul also received the tag. After Muga Silk, Joha rice and Tezpur litchi also earned the GI tag.</p>
