      <h1>Trump support booms among GOP base in Iowa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:04:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author">Dominick Mastrangelo</a></address>
      <p>President Trump is backed by a record number of registered Republicans in the state of Iowa, according to a new poll.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2019/11/18/iowa-poll-results-president-trump-popularity-sky-high-among-registered-republicans/4205580002/">poll</a>, conducted by the <i>Des Moines Register</i> and released Monday, shows Trump's approval rating among Republicans at a lofty 85%, up four points since March.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s doing a tremendous job, really, as far as I’m concerned,” Trump supporter Wayne Sparker told the largest newspaper in a key early-voting state for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.</p>
      <p>The poll was conducted Nov. 8-13, before the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/sondland-could-provide-linchpin-testimony-in-this-weeks-impeachment-proceedings">first public</a> congressional testimony in the impeachment investigation into <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">Trump's July 25 phone call</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

      <p>A majority of respondents said they "were almost certain Trump would win" a 2020 general election against any of the <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html">four leading</a> Democratic candidates for president, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p>

      <p>In a Monday morning tweet, Trump thanked his loyalist supporters and called the impeachment investigation a sham.</p>
      <p>"Never has the Republican Party been so united as it is now," he said. "This is a great fraud being played out against the American people by the Fake News Media &amp; their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats. The rules are rigged by Pelosi &amp; Schiff, but we are winning, and we will win!"</p>
