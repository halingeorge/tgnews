      <h1>Walmart plays catch-up in Amazon ecommerce battle</h1>
      <h2>World’s biggest retailer strives to ‘move faster’ on its digital transformation strategy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:40:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Gray</a></address>
      <p>Few retailers are coping better than Walmart with the relentless rise of Amazon. While earnings reports this week are expected to show how mall-based and department store chains are still struggling to adapt to the age of ecommerce, Walmart’s recent financial performance has demonstrated its resilience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dba1dfce-06d7-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">Revenue growth accelerated</a> in the run-up to the holiday season, and its shares are trading near record highs to value Walmart at $338bn. The company has been less susceptible to the turmoil elsewhere in retail in part because of the scale of its grocery business, which accounts for more than half of US sales.</p>
      <p>But while Walmart remains comfortably the country’s largest retailer — net sales of $510bn last year were more than double Amazon’s — it remains an online minnow compared with its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/534f8dfa-7655-11e9-bbad-7c18c0ea0201">Seattle-based rival</a> and its chief executive has acknowledged the need to step up efforts to compete.</p>
      <p>“We’re making progress on many fronts, but we need to do more and move faster,” Doug McMillon said last week about the pace of the retailer’s digital transformation.</p>
      <p>Mr McMillon added he wanted Walmart’s ecommerce team to “better execute the fundamentals, and improve the overall economics” of the group’s digital business.</p>
      <p>Walmart loses money in ecommerce, but Mr McMillon feels the need to keep experimenting. If he fails, Walmart risks being disrupted in the way that the big box retailer itself upended America’s retail landscape.</p>
      <p>Walmart’s latest quarterly results showed US ecommerce sales jumped 41 per cent from a year ago. But the investments needed to achieve that have weighed on profit — operating income in the third quarter fell 5.4 per cent from a year ago — and also led to tension at the top of the company, whose US chief Greg Foran unexpectedly announced his departure last month.</p>
      <p>Groceries have been the source of Walmart’s biggest ecommerce successes, as opposed to the general merchandise category that is dominated by Amazon.</p>
      <p>The big box retailer’s kerbside collection service enables customers to order online and pick up in person from more than 3,000 locations. The service plays to Walmart’s strengths, helping the Arkansas-based group integrate its internet offering with its formidable physical presence. It also avoids the challenges associated with delivery. While about 1,400 Walmart stores offer the service, grocery delivery has struggled to take off in the US as it has in other markets such as the UK — in part because of the country’s vast size.</p>

      <p>“I’m not convinced grocery sales online are ever going to be profitable,” said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at the retail technology specialists RSR Research. Difficulties include ensuring fresh food is kept at the right temperature, while the need for employees to pack large numbers of low-value items — a job done in traditional stores by grocery shoppers — adds to the cost.</p>
      <p>Still, many in the industry believe that if any legacy retailer can make online grocery delivery work, it will be Walmart. Bill Simon, a former head of Walmart’s US business, said the group’s big competitive advantage online lay in groceries. “There’s really no one else who has the ability to deliver to every zip code in the country,” he said.</p>
      <p>General merchandise has been tougher for Walmart, in large part because of Amazon’s might. Walmart has sought to expand through a string of new ventures and acquisitions aimed in part at broadening its appeal beyond its traditional demographic of low- and middle-income households. The most prominent was Jet, an online store that Walmart bought for $3.3bn three years ago. Marc Lore, who founded Jet in 2014, took charge of Walmart’s online operations after the acquisition.</p>

      <p>But the results have been mixed. Walmart last month agreed to sell ModCloth, a women’s clothing website, for an undisclosed amount little more than two years after buying it. The company is examining a disposal of Jetblack, a text message-based personal shopping service, according to Bloomberg, and said last month it had replaced the unit’s chief executive. Walmart has also shaken up Jet itself, reining its scope by confining it to urban markets.</p>
      <p>Mr Lore said last week that Walmart had “evolved” its ecommerce plans to focus more on brands developed internally, such as the online mattress range Allswell and recently launched fashion line Scoop, than on acquisitions. He added that the group’s overall ecommerce strategy “hasn’t changed”. “We’re focused on nailing the fundamentals and improving the experience.”</p>
      <p>For some analysts, Walmart needs to broaden its appeal to consumers by widening the number of items on its “marketplace” platform, through which third parties sell items on Walmart.com.</p>
      <p>Walmart offers 75m items online, the vast majority through its marketplace, which is a fraction of what is available on Amazon. “It’s a long way from its true potential,” said David Spitz, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, an ecommerce company.</p>
      <p>The prize to Walmart of succeeding online remains great, however — while the risks of failure are existential. “We’re committed to building a larger, healthier ecommerce business,” Mr McMillon said. “Our customers want that, our marketplace sellers want that. And so do we.”</p>
