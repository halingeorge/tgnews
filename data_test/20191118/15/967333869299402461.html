        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Russia's Gazprom has officially proposed to Ukraine's Naftogaz to extend the existing contract for the Russian gas transit through Ukraine, which expires in the end of the year, or to sign a new deal for one year taking into consideration the forecast for the European Union's gas demand.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Today, Gazprom sent to Naftogaz an official proposal, signed by Management Committee Chairman Alexey Miller, on extending the existing contract or signing a new agreement on gas transit through the Ukrainian territory for one year, taking into consideration the forecast for European consumers' gas demand for 2020," Gazprom said in a statement.</blockquote>
      <p>Both the extension of the active contract and the signing of a new one are only possible if both sides withdraw all claims filed with the international arbitrage and cease all court proceedings, if the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine abolishes its decision on slapping Gazprom with a fine over alleged economical competition breach, and if Naftogaz calls off its request for the European Commission to launch a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201902261072740737-russia-china-gazprom-gas-imports-plans/">probe against Gazprom</a>, the Russian gas giant added.</p>
      <p>Gazprom also said it awaited Kiev's position on its readiness to buy Russian gas directly starting in 2020.</p>
