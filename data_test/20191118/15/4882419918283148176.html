      <p>The RFEF have published their refereeing appointments for the weekend - week 14 of La Liga - the first after the international break.</p>
      <p>Santiago Jaime Latre is taking charge of Barcelona's trip to face Leganes at Butarque on Saturday, 1pm. The VAR ref will be Mario Melero López.</p>

      <p>Latre has reffed Barca 10 times, they have won eight and drawn two. However he fell out with Lionel Messi last time out, in a 1-1 draw against Athletic at Camp Nou. The cameras captured Messi saying "you're threatening me, you're threatening me, always the same with you, always the same," to the official.</p>
      <p>Messi came on off the bench in that game and criticised the officials for their leniency towards Athletic players and for a corner not given.</p>
      <p>That wasn't the first time Messi had problems with Latre. In 16-17, a 2-1 win at Sevilla, Messi was booked for tying his shoelace on the pitch, in a surreal incident that the referee deemed timewasting. Barca appealed the card.</p>
