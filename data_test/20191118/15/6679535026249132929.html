      <h2>BBMP officials hope to implement it at least in January 2020</h2>

      <p>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) self-imposed deadline of implementing new garbage tenders by November 1 is long past, and these tenders seem to have gone into cold storage.</p>
      <p>For the first time, the BBMP had floated separate tenders for collection of wet and dry waste. Despite stiff resistance from the councillors, the civic body went ahead with the tenders after pointing out that this was mandated under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.</p>
      <p>Senior officials told <i>The Hindu </i>that though the process of floating garbage tenders and finalising them began more than 10 months ago, just around 40-odd tenders of 198 had been finalised. Many files pertaining to the tenders were pending with the Standing Committee for Health.</p>
      <p>The BBMP is now trying to get the High Court of Karnataka stay on issue of work order vacated. “We have consulted the Legal Cell. The case is likely to come up for hearing sometime next week,” an official said.</p>
      <p>A few contractors had gone to court challenging the garbage tenders, following which a stay was issued. Confident of getting the stay vacated, the official said the new tenders, in all likelihood, will come into effect from January 2020.</p>
      <p>The official stated that the January deadline seemed likely, as the civic body would have to first issue work orders to the contractors and later give them at least one month’s time to mobilise resources.</p>
      <p>As per rules, tenders that are below ₹3 crore should be approved by the Standing Committee for Health and those above it have to be approved by the BBMP council. Though over 100 files pertaining to the tenders have been sent to the standing committee, it had approved only around 40. With the change in ruling dispensation in the council, the elections to standing committees are yet to be held.</p>
      <p>BBMP officials are also exploring the possibility of tabling all files pertaining to the tender before the council itself for approval.</p>
      <p>Waste management activists stressed on the need to implement the new garbage tenders for better waste management. Despite opposition from several quarters, separate tenders for wet and dry waste were floated. The levels of segregation of waste at source have dropped to around 30%.</p>
      <p>“The new tenders, which stress on segregated waste, will hopefully reduce BBMP’s dependence on landfills and quarries,” pointed out an SWM expert and said that both the High Court and the National Green Tribunal had taken serious note of the same.</p>
