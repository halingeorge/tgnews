      <h1>West Dunbartonshire residents to access council services at libraries</h1>
      <h2>One Stop Shop services will be available at library branches across West Dunbartonshire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:52:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Foulds, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-foulds/</a></address>
      <p>Residents are set to get access to council services through their local libraries in a bid to save £150,000 a year.</p>
      <p>As has been piloted in Alexandria for the last 18 months, the One Stop Shop services will be available at library branches across West Dunbartonshire.</p>
      <p>According to the council, both residents and staff in Alexandria have found it “a positive move with a welcoming and calm environment to visit and work in”.</p>
      <p>However, the Labour group were opposed to the move at a corporate services committee meeting last week.</p>
      <p>Councillor Martin Rooney said: “The more and more we reduce the library element and expand the other elements, the less likely there will be a library service in the future.</p>
      <p>“It’s there because it’s protected by law but I can envisage a time the library element will be an add-on.</p>
      <p>“I don’t support the constant diminution of the library services.”</p>
      <p>Labour tabled an amendment calling for the matter to be discussed at a full council meeting next week so all elected members could vote.</p>
      <p>However, the bid was rejected by the ruling administration who pushed through the plans, saying they made libraries sustainable for the future.</p>
      <p>Labour councillor David McBride questioned the positive feedback received, saying: “All the feedback we have here is anecdotal.”</p>
      <p>He said he also had worries over the quality of the new service, saying: “You can’t spread the service over so many additional hours and tell me the quality is improving.”</p>
      <p>The One Stop Shop team will join with library services and provide this assistance in all eight library branches.</p>
      <p>The council say the change would mean residents in places like Balloch would be able to access citizen services much closer to home without having to travel to town centres. It would also increase the hours available to support residents with enquiries from 105 per week to 287 per week.</p>
      <p>Councillor Ian Dickson, convener of corporate services, said: “These changes will significantly enhance the services that people receive in their communities, providing face to face support in local areas and also increasing the times at which residents can access this service to include evenings and Saturday mornings.</p>
      <p>“We recognise the importance of libraries in each area, and want them to continue to be hubs within our community.</p>
      <p>“These plans will deliver on this, increasing footfall, providing access to books, IT and literacy and reducing isolation.”</p>
