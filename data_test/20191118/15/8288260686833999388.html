      <h1>'Never' - Agent hits out at Wolves transfer speculation</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers transfer latest | Patrick Cutrone has already been linked with a move away from Molineux</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:56:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Patrick Cutrone’s agent has quashed rumours the striker could be about to quit Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>Italy striker Cutrone, who scored twice for his nation’s under-21s in a 3-0 win over Iceland on Saturday, only joined <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> from AC Milan in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old signed a four-year contract at Molineux and has already become a hugely popular figure with supporters.</p>

      <p>Cutrone has scored just two goals in 19 appearances, but most of those outings have come from the bench under <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo.</a></p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.primocanale.it/notizie/la-sampdoria-punta-cutrone-trattativa-avviatissima-con-il-wolverhampton-213374.html">rumours have surprisingly surfaced</a> to suggest Cutrone could return to Italy with Sampdoria reportedly interested.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But Cutrone’s agent, Donato Orgnoni, has laughed off those claims and insists his client is only focused on life at his new club.</p>
      <p>“We’ve never thought of leaving Wolves,” <a href="https://www.sampnews24.com/esclusiva-cutrone-samp-lagente-nega-rimane-in-inghilterra/">he told SampNews.</a> “I don’t understand why certain news comes out. He remains in England one hundred percent.”</p>
