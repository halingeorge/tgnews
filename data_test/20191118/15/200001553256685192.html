      <h1>‘All clues lead to Crystal Palace’ – Claim of ‘broad agreement’ on €25m transfer – Pause button now hit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:33:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Late on Friday evening, Italian journalist <a href="https://www.alfredopedulla.com/esclusiva-kouame-ko-era-a-un-passo-dal-crystal-palace-due-profili-per-il-genoa/">Alfredo Pedulla</a> published claims about the future of Christian Kouame, presenting the news as an exclusive.</p>
      <p>The 21 year old Genoa player had picked up a knee injury whilst away with the Ivory Coast U23 team, and it was explained this could kill a transfer that was close to being agreed.</p>
      <p>Genoa chairman Enrico Preziosi was said to have reached a ‘broad agreement’ to sell the player to a Premier League club.</p>
      <p>Newcastle United had been interested, but it was stated ‘all clues lead to Crystal Palace’.</p>
      <p>The agreement for the forward was put at €25m plus more in bonuses.</p>
      <p>Crystal Palace were in the final stages of negotiations, so, on Friday, it was hoped the knee injury wouldn’t be overly serious.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, medical tests then revealed Kouame has a cruciate ligament injury and he’s set to have an operation today.</p>
      <p>That will kill a January transfer to Crystal Palace or anywhere else, and potentially end Genoa’s chances of getting anything like €25m for the player in the future.</p>
