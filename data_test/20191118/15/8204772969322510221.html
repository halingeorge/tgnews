      <h1>Storyful receives another cash injection from Murdoch’s News Corp</h1>
      <h2>Parent has ploughed over €33 million into its the Irish-founded subsidiary since mid-2016</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/charlie-taylor-7.3745954" target="_blank">Charlie Taylor</a></address>
      <p>Loss-making Storyful received a €4 million cash injection from Rupert Murdoch’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=News+Corp">News Corp</a> earlier this month, bringing the total amount provided by its parent to nearly €40 million since it was acquired.</p>
      <p>The Dublin-based company, which uses social media feeds, user-generated content and proprietary technology to frame news reporting, was sitting on accumulated losses of more than €24 million at the end of June 2018.</p>
      <p>Storyful was co-founded by former <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=RT%C3%89">RTÉ</a> journalist <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mark+Little">Mark Little</a> in 2010 and acquired in a €18 million deal by News Corp in 2013.</p>
      <p>While it began as a so-called “social news agency”, Storyful has in recent years expanded to help brands better manage their corporate reputations.</p>
      <p>Recently filed documents show Storyful received €4 million in fresh equity from News Corp last week. This is in addition to the €5.5 million cash injection it got earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Storyful also received €12 million in fresh equity from News Corp last June and Prior to this it was given €4.5 million from its parent in September 2016 and a further €7.2 million in November 2017.</p>
      <h3>Subsidiary</h3>
      <p>Combined this brings to €33.3 million that News Corp has ploughed into the subsidiary since mid-2016, and to €39.3 million in total since it acquired the company.</p>
      <p>The last set of publicly available accounts for the company show it reported a €9 million loss in the 12 months to the end of June 2018.</p>
      <p>Storyful said at the time that it had made “substantial” investments in its peoduct and technology departments that year.</p>
      <p>The company employed 138 people at the end of June las tyear, up from 100 people 12 months earlier. Staff costs during that period fell to €6.7 million from €12 million with directors’s remuneration totalling €315,258.</p>
      <p>After staying with Storyful after its acquisition, Mr Little left in 2015 to briefly lead Twitter Ireland. More recently, he co-founded Kinzen with Áine Kerr and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paul+Watson">Paul Watson</a>.</p>
      <p>The new digital news venture officially launched earlier this year. Mr Watson recently left Kinzen to take up the role of chief technology officer with a new company called <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Caliber+Media+Works">Caliber Media Works</a>.</p>
