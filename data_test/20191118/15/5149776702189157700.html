      <h1>Five things not to miss at Nottingham's Winter Wonderland 2019</h1>
      <h2>Panoramic glass drinking area, Altitude, now has its own bar and there's a pop-up boozer on the balcony too</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:39:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>Ho ho hooray! Nottingham's <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/winter-wonderland">Winter Wonderland</a> (the best in the UK according to style-bible Vogue) is officially open.</p>
      <p>Its launch was marked with a low-key <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> lights switch-on on Friday afternoon (November 15) where carols were sung, mulled wine was glugged and a troupe of extraordinarily talented youngsters took to the ice for a quartet of applause-worthy skating routines.</p>
      <p>Three days on and with the opening weekend under its belt, Slab Square's festive affair is in full swing with all bolts tightened, holes filled and teething problems solved.</p>
      <p>Bigger than it has ever been, this year's Winter Wonderland has its largest ice rink to date as well as two brand new bars and outdoor seating on the balcony.</p>
      <p>Stretching from Trinity Square, where <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/first-look-inside-thors-tipi-3542109">Thor's Tipi </a>has now taken up residency for the Yuletide season, to Angel Row, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/old-market-square">Old Market Square</a> and Long Row, there is certainly more than a day's worth of Christmas fun to explore.</p>
      <p>If time is short, however, we'd recommend checking off at least one of these five things you'd certainly be silly to miss.</p>
      <h3>Altitude bar</h3>

      <p>It's all change for Winter Wonderland's 360-degree elevated glass drinking lounge this year.</p>
      <p>Having previously provided scenic views of smokers outside the Joseph Else, the venue, which sits on top of the all-new ice bar, has been shifted 90 degrees south to now face the city's biggest ever outdoor ice rink.</p>
      <p>Still decorated with festive branches, fairy lights and faux-fur rugs, the popular hangout has its own bar for 2019. Last year visitors were welcome to bring drinks from neighbouring Sur la Piste ski lodge bar or choose to use Altitude's table service option.</p>
      <p>But now punters need only trot over to the in-house bar, which offers draughtbeer, wines, spirits and mixers.</p>
      <p>For the first time there is also an outside bar on the balcony too, which will be open at busier times and has its own seating.</p>
      <h3>Ice Mountain toboggan</h3>

      <p>New for last year, the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/tried-out-new-toboggan-ride-2222100">Ice Mountain toboggan</a> is back for 2019. Already proving as popular as ever, a hefty queue of thrill-seekers were spotted hauling inflatable tubes up the attraction in anticipation for their turn down the slope.</p>
      <p>Thirteen and a half tonnes of steel has been used to create the 30-metre long slide which was specially designed from scratch for the city and was built using the gradient of King Street as a guide.</p>
      <p>The dry ski slope slide, made from material similar to astro-turf, has riders whizzing down the city centre street on inflatable dingies.</p>
      <p>Part of this year's <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/winter-wonderland">Winter Wonderland</a> , the ride can accommodate two people at any one time, and will cost £3 for two goes.</p>
      <h3>Ice Bar</h3>

      <p>This year the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/nottinghams-new-winter-wonderland-ice-3538572">ice bar</a> has made the transition from being a novelty attraction into a fully-fledged boozer. With more room to enjoy chilled vodka shots, served straight from a glass made of ice, or a cheeky glass of fizz, the prime positioned faux-fur covered sofas make for more of a lounge bar-style vibe than ice sculpture gallery.</p>
      <p>It's the most interactive it's ever been, too, with a life-size bob sleigh to crawl into with your mates, a giant pint-swilling grizzly bear to cheers and, bespoke to Nottingham, an air hockey table made entirely from ice, which is fully playable.</p>
      <p>In the last four years, the ice bar has grown to twice its original size, and included Lapland and Narnia themes.</p>
      <p>If you can brave it, entry allows up to an hour inside including two drinks (£13) or two drinks and a glass of fizz (£16).</p>
      <p>It will be open until New Year's Eve, when the sad process of melting it down begins.</p>
      <h3>Helter Skelter</h3>

      <p>A bar which truly does offer something for kids and grown-ups alike. Adults can enjoy a hot mulled wine, cider or beer in the pub below while, armed with £2 for the pleasure, little ones can have a ride on the Helter Skelter slide.</p>
      <p>Located on Long Row, outside Primark, the views from the top are something worth taking in with an uninterrupted vista of the Christmas lights leading down to Old Market Square.</p>
      <h3>Ice Skating</h3>

      <p>Taking inspiration from the slopes, the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/nottingham-winter-wonderlands-ice-rink-3543239">East Midlands' largest outdoor ice rink</a> is now (unofficially) divided into three different difficulty levels, described by organisers as similar to the concept of green, red and black 'runs'.</p>
      <p>The 1,160 square metre rink now has a 5 metre by 16 metre kids' ice rink for the little ones, its usual rink for all and a new 200 metre square ice path around the fountains, installed at an incline to add a little challenge to the more experienced skaters.</p>
      <p>Stewards will be supervising all areas and if anyone looks like they are struggling will be on hand to help.</p>
      <p>Visitors can skate from the age of four but children’s skate aids and lockers are limited, available at the skate hire desk only on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
      <p>Tickets can be booked in advance at nottinghamwinterwonderland.co.uk, priced at £10.50 per child, £40 for a family ticket and £13 for adults.</p>
