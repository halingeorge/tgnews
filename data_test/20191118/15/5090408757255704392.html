      <h1>Chick-fil-A is ending donations criticized by LGBTQ activists after years of backlash, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:53:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Business Insider</a></address>
      <p>On Monday, Chick-fil-A announced it was making a major change to perhaps the most controversial part of the company: its charitable giving arm.</p>
      <p>In a press release, the company said it will “deepen its giving to a smaller number of organizations working exclusively in the areas of education, homelessness and hunger.” A Chick-fil-A representative confirmed that the organization will no longer donate to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-explains-donations-groups-considered-anti-gay-2019-5">two organization that have been criticized by LGBTQ advocates</a>.</p>
      <p>“We made multiyear commitments to both organizations, and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018. Moving forward you will see that the Chick-fil-A Foundation will support the three specific initiatives of homelessness, hunger and education,” the representative said in a statement to Business Insider.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A had previously worked with the groups to fund specific programs – such as summer camps – that work directly with underprivileged children.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-backlash-as-expands-into-uk-2019-10">Chick-fil-A has faced backlash</a> for its donations and those of its top executives for years. Prior to 2012, Chick-fil-A made significant donations to right-wing and religious organizations known for lobbying against LGBTQ rights through the WinShape Foundation.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A stopped making donations to almost all controversial groups after facing backlash in 2012, when CEO Dan Cathy said he did not support same-sex marriage. However, the company continued its relationships with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>Rodney Bullard, the head of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-explains-donations-groups-considered-anti-gay-2019-5">defended the donations in an interview with Business Insider earlier this year,</a> saying they were “relevant and impactful in the community.”</p>
      <p>“For us, that’s a much higher calling than any political or cultural war that’s being waged,” Bullard said.</p>
