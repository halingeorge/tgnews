      <h1>“I don’t understand” – Agent says Wolves player 100% staying at club, dismisses rumours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:14:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>When an Italian leaves Serie A it’s rarely seen as a long term thing, especially if they’re at the beginning of a career.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it was always likely Patrick Cutrone would be repeatedly linked with a move back to the country after signing for Wolves. If he impressed in England, there’d be big Serie A clubs interested, and if not it would be sides traditionally further down the table.</p>
      <p>It’s exactly the same situation with Moise Kean at Everton.</p>
      <p>On Monday morning, Genoa’s <a href="https://www.primocanale.it/notizie/la-sampdoria-punta-cutrone-trattativa-avviatissima-con-il-wolverhampton-213374.html">PrimoCanale</a> reported Cutrone wants to return to Italy, and negotiations are already underway with Sampdoria.</p>
      <p>It was stated the club are considering signing the Wolves player on loan in January, with a obligation to make the move permanent in the summer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sampnews24.com/esclusiva-cutrone-samp-lagente-nega-rimane-in-inghilterra/">SampNews24</a> picked up on the story and contacted Cutrone’s agent Donato Orgnoni.</p>
      <p>He’s dismissed the claims completely, and is quoted as saying: “<i>We’ve never thought of leaving Wolves. I don’t understand why certain news comes out. He remains in England one hundred percent.”</i></p>
      <p>The 21 year old has totalled 280 minutes in the Premier League so far this season, with further appearances in the Europa League and EFL Cup.</p>
