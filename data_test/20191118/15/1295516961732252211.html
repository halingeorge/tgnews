      <p>With the conclusion of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> leaving an open-ended future for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mark-ruffalo-kevin-feige-talk-hulk-mcu-future/">Bruce Banner and The Hulk</a>, many began speculating when (or if) we would next see Mark Ruffalo reprise his role as the character. However, according to the actor himself, the Green Goliath may soon be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the upcoming <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/she-hulk/"><i>She-Hulk</i></a> series on Disney+.</p>
      <p>"I'm supposed to go talk with the great Mr. Feige to see if there's some place..." Ruffalo told <a href="https://people.com/tv/mark-ruffalo-wouldnt-mind-if-the-hulk-has-a-cameo-in-she-hulk/?fbclid=IwAR2OCcf4FtPjr1faQLJMET6CSXS-wGYpcImemzp5XLEEk2bAoEN_SjH3An0"><i>People</i></a> when asked about a possible <i>She-Hulk</i> cameo. "Sure, why not! It's been a great ride," he added.</p>

      <p>Aside from <i>Rick and Morty</i>'s <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvels-she-hulk-disney-series-lands-rick-and-morty-writer/">Jessica Gao being hired to work on the series</a>, Marvel Studios has remained tight-lipped regarding <i>She-Hulk</i> and <a href="https://screenrant.com/she-hulk-betty-ross-liv-tyler-return-rumor/amp/">its cast</a>. However, considering the importance of Bruce Banner within the comic book origin of She-Hulk/Jennifer Walters, it stands to reason Ruffalo's Banner will have <i>some</i> sort of presence in the series.</p>
      <p>Ruffalo most recently appeared as the Hulk in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, the film also stars Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Karen Gillan as Nebula, Danai Gurira as Okoye and Bradley Cooper as Rocket, with Gwyneth Paltrow Pepper Potts, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Benedict Wong as Wong, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie and Josh Brolin as Thanos. <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> is available on Digital HD, Blu-ray and 4K UHD.</p>
