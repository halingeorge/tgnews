      <h1>Southwest BRT line to launch in December, ending years-long controversy</h1>

      <p>It could be considered a Christmas miracle that the southwest BRT line, formally named the MAX Yellow Line, will launch operations Dec. 23 after years of controversy.</p>
      <p>Since 2010, when southwest residents first received notice about the project, it has been a hotly contested issue with councillors and community members battling it out as either fierce advocates or opponents.</p>
      <p>While a vocal group said the project was poorly planned, unfeasible and a waste of money, others call it a necessary addition to the city’s transit network to connect communities to key institutions. Construction began in 2018 and will finally be complete next month.</p>
      <p>“If we keep feeding the rider experience and allowing more individuals to take transit without burdening their time of day, I think it’s a fantastic thing,” said Coun. Shane Keating, who chairs the city’s transportation committee.</p>

      <p>The MAX Yellow line will service Calgary’s southwest beginning in the community of Woodbine into the core, and will travel to Mount Royal University, Rockyview General Hospital, Southland Leisure Centre, Heritage Park and downtown. It will connect with the MAX Teal line in the southwest.</p>
      <p>It’s the final piece to complete four additions to the city’s transit network that has seen new BRT stations crop up in all four quadrants of the city.</p>
      <p>Some opponents said there wasn’t enough ridership to justify the project. Keating said that may be true for certain portions of the line, but the project is about the bigger picture.</p>
      <p>“It may not be used in segments of the line, but it will certainly be used from start to termination and that is the thing — it’s the service along the whole line that is crucial, not one or two small segments of the line,” said Keating.</p>
      <p>“We have to continually strive to get better public transit, simply for the sake of the city itself. You can’t continually build roads, you need to give people the opportunity to get off of them.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, councillors Diane Colley-Urquhart and Jeromy Farkas, who campaigned to cancel the project but were ultimately outvoted, remain critical of the project but are focusing on the silver lining.</p>
      <p>Colley-Urquhart said the project has improved existing infrastructure in the southwest, such as improvements to Anderson Road’s connection with the ring road and existing transit stations, but her worries are related to its operating budget.</p>

      <p>“The proof is going to be in the pudding,” said Colley-Urquhart.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying now that we have invested all this money into capital infrastructure that we not use it at all, but with the state of the economy and the low ridership that is anticipated well into the next five to 10 years, I just don’t think we need the same operational costs that we determined many years ago.”</p>
      <p>A final decision on the 2020 municipal budget is expected later this month and the southwest councillor said identifying the costs associated with the MAX Yellow Line will be a key consideration for her during budget negotiations.</p>
      <p>Farkas said he’s been “rolling up his sleeves” to make it a successful project, despite the fact he didn’t support it.</p>
      <p>His biggest concern is how the BRT line will affect the level of existing transit services in the community from neighbourhood feeder roads.</p>
      <p>“There are only so many buses and bus drivers,” he said, adding that residents who live close to the yellow line will reap its benefits while others farther away will have a harder time accessing public transit.</p>
      <p>“It begs more questions than answers in my mind.”</p>
