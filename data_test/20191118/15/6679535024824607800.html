      <p>Ramanathapuram</p>
      <p>Minister for School Education, Youth Welfare and Sports Development K.A. Sengottaiyan has said the government has proposed to unveil an ambitious scheme to offer Chartered Accountant (CA) coaching for students soon after their plus two public examinations.</p>
      <p>Addressing after launching a special literacy programme by the Directorate of Non-Formal and Adult Education at Kilakarai near here on Monday, he said the government proposed to offer the CA coaching to 25,000 students every year as there would be huge demand for CAs in the post GST regime.</p>
      <p>He said it had been estimated that Tamil Nadu would require about 10 lakh CAs for auditing in the post GST regime but there were only about 8.85 lakh CAs in the whole country. After the coaching programme, Tamil Nadu would emerge on top in the country in producing CAs, he said.</p>
      <p>He said the special literacy programme had been launched at the cost of â‚¹ 6.23 crore in Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar districts, identified as aspirational districts to impart literacy to non-literates in the 15-35 age group, post literacy for neo-literates for sustaining literacy skills and provide opportunity to enhance education for the drops outs, especially, women.</p>
      <p>The programme would help to impart literacy to 67,968 illiterates and dropouts in Ramanathapuram district, he said adding the programme would be implemented till 2021 in four phases, each phase lasting for six months.</p>
      <p>At the end of the programme, the beneficiaries would be given basic education certificates after an examination, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sengottaiyan said the government had so far distributed 54.50 lakh laptops to school students under the free laptop distribution scheme. He said steps were being taken to provide smart boards to 92,000 government schools and establish smart classrooms in 7,500 schools by January, 2020.</p>
      <p>The new education policy introduced in the State would help students to crack all the competitive examinations, he said. The Minister also announced that the government would distribute shoes and socks to school children instead of footwear from the next academic year onwards.</p>
      <p>Collector K Veera Raghava Rao, Director, Directorate of Non-Formal and Adult Education V.C. Rameswaramurugan, Thiruvadanai MLA Karunas, Paramakudi MLA Sadan Prabakar and former MP A. Anwhar Raajhaa were present at the function.</p>
