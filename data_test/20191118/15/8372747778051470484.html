      <p>COLLIER COUNTY, Fla. â€” Naples may start letting dog owners walk their pups off-leash at one area beach, but first, they want to know what you think of the idea.</p>
      <p>Right now, dogs are not allowed on any Collier County Beaches.</p>
      <p>The new proposal would only allow dogs at Lowdermilk Park Beach Monday through Friday from sunrise to 8:30 in the morning.</p>
      <p>It's not a broad time-frame, but one woman who started this petition says a small amount of time will help more people get on board with the idea.</p>
