      <p>Sara Lee Bread is facing an onslaught of raunchy comments on social media after the baked-goods brand was featured on a "Saturday Night Live" skit starring Harry Styles.</p>

      <p>Sara Lee initially responded by hiding the comments. "SNL" writer Bowen Yang <a href="https://twitter.com/bowenyang/status/1196125988423438338">accused</a> the company of deleting some comments as well, though the company denied this in a statement to Business Insider.</p>
      <p>Sara Lee said it has now made all comments visible again, and that it is monitoring the account for anything that violates Instagram standards.</p>

      <p>"We didn't know about or participate in the creation of the skit so as you can imagine, waking up to all those comments threw us for a bit of a loop," the company's statement said. "We didn't delete any comments but did temporarily hide them until we could read through and understand what happened. All comments are now visible and we will be monitoring for any that violate Instagram standards. While the explicit jokes in the skit do not align with Sara Lee Bread's brand, we know SNL pushes the envelope for laughs and are taking it all in stride."</p>
      <p>The skit featured a fictional social media manager, played by Styles, who posted sexually explicit comments online using Sara Lee's Instagram account. The comments included "wreck me daddy" and "destroy me king," which were posted by Sara Lee's Instagram to Nick Jonas' account. The fictional manager also wrote under Sara Lee's account: "Feeling really depressed after threesome. What was supposed to be a fantasy ended up more rejection. Must get rid of toxic in community."</p>
      <p>Many of the comments that flooded Sara Lee's Instagram account after "SNL" aired were taken directly from the skit.</p>
