      <h1>More misery for drivers in Alexandria and Balloch</h1>
      <h2>Delays in the Vale town centre and at Lomond Bridge.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:37:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">Lorraine Weir</a></address>
      <p>Motorists across Alexandria and Balloch are set for yet more disruption with two new sets of roadworks springing up over the last week.</p>
      <p>There were lengthy queues in Alexandria town centre at the end of last week and over the weekend with temporary traffic lights put up on Main Street to accommodate ongoing Scottish Power work.</p>
      <p>And temporary lights were also set up on Lomond Bridge in Balloch during preparatory works on the parapet ahead of a £3.6million replacement project.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The restrictions in the Vale are due to remain in place into next week as “essential mains cable replacement” is carried out which is scheduled to be completed on Wednesday, September 27.</p>
      <p>An irate driver told us: “The problem, yet again, is that these are all happening at the same time. No-one in the area has a problem with roadworks but the problem is there is no joined up thinking as to when they happen.</p>
      <p>“They need to keep drivers in mind when they decide to go ahead with these works all at the one time.”</p>
      <p>The works in Balloch are expected to last for six months following the commencement of the works in full.</p>

      <p>A West Dunbartonshire Council spokeswoman added: “Essential preparatory work ahead of the refurbishment of Lomond Bridge is ongoing. When full works begin, we anticipate restrictions will be in place in this area for around six months.”</p>
      <p>We reported earlier this year how, up to the start of September drivers had to endure 350 days of hell on the roads due to works with these latest adding to the already huge total.</p>
      <p>And Dumbarton councillor David McBride made a plea to council chiefs to try and learn from the mistakes which have seen drivers across West Dunbartonshire stuck in lengthy queues throughout 2019.</p>

      <p>He said communities endured “significant delays and inconvenience” in a motion which gained cross-party support and ordered the authority to compile a list of all works over a six-month period outlining where lessons could be learned.</p>
