      <h1>Brazil Amazon deforestation soars to 11-year high in 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:53:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, BRAZIL: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deforestation">Deforestation</a> in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brazil">Brazil</a>'s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Amazon-rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a> rose to its highest in over a decade this year, government data on Monday showed, confirming a sharp rise under the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>Brazil's INPE space research agency said deforestation reached 9,762 square kilometers, up 29.5 per cent, for the 12 months through July 2019.</p>
      <p>That's the worst level of deforestation since 2008, heaping further pressure on the environmental policy of Bolsonaro who favors developing the Amazon region economically.</p>
      <p>Environment minister Ricardo Salles told reporters in a briefing on the figures that Brazil would roll out a series of measures to counter the rising deforestation, including stepping up enforcement efforts assisted by high-resolution satellite imaging.</p>
      <p>Salles said he would meet with governors of Amazon states on Wednesday to further discuss tactics to counter deforestation, adding that the figures show a new strategy was needed and that sustainable economic opportunities must be developed in the region.</p>
      <p>The Amazon is the world's largest <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tropical-rainforest">tropical rainforest</a> and is considered key to the fight against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/climate-change">climate change</a> because of the vast amounts of carbon dioxide it absorbs.</p>
