      <p>Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
      <p>Deputy Prime Minister<br/>Minister of Foreign Affairs</p>

      <p>PĀNUI PĀPĀHO<br/>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
      <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced further support as the Government of Samoa responds to a serious measles outbreak.</p>
      <p>“New Zealand will deploy a further 18 vaccination nurses, bringing the total to 30 working in Samoa over the next four weeks,” Mr Peters said.</p>
      <p>“A New Zealand Medical Assistance Team (NZMAT) of ten doctors and nurses and support staff will deploy to Apia early tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>“On 15 November the Government of Samoa declared a State of Emergency as the numbers of people infected with measles continues to rise and the hospital system is under strain.</p>
      <p>“We fully support Samoa’s efforts to immunise its population, contain the outbreak, and treat patients who are ill.”</p>
      <p>“The vaccination nurses will support Samoa’s immunisation programme, which is targeting the most at risk populations.”</p>
      <p>“The medical assistance team will support Samoan health personnel, providing treatment and medical supplies in a district hospital on Upolu that is facing heavy demand due to the outbreak.”</p>
      <p>The support announced today is in addition to the deployment of 12 vaccination nurses, vaccines and medical supplies New Zealand committed to Samoa last week.</p>
