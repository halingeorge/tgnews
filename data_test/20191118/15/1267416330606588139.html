      <h2>The company is looking to compete with Spotify and Apple Music</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:08:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>TikTok owner, ByteDance Technology, is reportedly going to launch its own streaming service, according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ffaed23a-07dd-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd"><i>Financial Times.</i></a></p>
      <p>The company is in talks with Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony Music to obtain global licensing deals for the music subscription service.</p>
      <p>ByteDance wants to launch the streaming service <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-music/tiktok-owner-bytedance-plans-to-launch-music-streaming-ft-idUSKBN1XS00P">as early as next month</a> in India, Indonesia and Brazil before launching in the United States sometime in the near future. There isn’t any word on a Canadian launch yet.</p>
      <p>In addition to on-demand music, the app will include a library of short video clips that users could sync to songs and then share with their friends. This feature borrows from TikTok’s social media hook in terms of video sharing.</p>
      <p>The streaming service is expected to cost less than Spotify and Apple Music making it less than $10 USD (approximately $13 CAD) per month.</p>
