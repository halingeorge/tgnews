        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cynthia-erivo/">Cynthia Erivo</a> recalls her experience working with Joe Alwyn on particularly challenging scenes in Harriet, and says he couldn’t have been more ‘gentle’ with her.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tony award-winning actress <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/cynthia-erivo-admits-hurt-immense-backlash-casting-harriet-tubman-biopic-10916865/">stars as Harriet Tubman in Kasi Lemons’ biopic</a> charting the activist’s escape from slavery in the 1800s, before returning to lead her own family to freedom using the Underground Railroad safehouses.</p>
      <p>Joe, 28, stars as slave owner Gideon Brodess which meant having to engage in difficult dialogue with Cynthia while in character. But Joe proved to be a true gentleman and made every effort to ensure the actress was comfortable during their emotionally-charged moments.</p>
      <p>Recalling what it was like to work with Joe, Cynthia told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘He has to be one of the nicest people I have ever met and I know it might sound like I’m just saying it to ease everyone’s mind, but no genuinely, he was the sweetest and he was super worried about me all the time.’</p>

      <p>Referring to one particularly harrowing exchange, Cynthia, 32, continued: ‘That very first scene between the tree, he was worried the entire time like, “Are you OK? I don’t want to hurt you. Shall we do it like that? Is this easier for you?” The entire time trying to find out if I was OK, he was so sweet, so gentle, that I knew that I would be safe with him.’</p>
      <p>Cynthia admitted she would have felt uncomfortable playing out those ‘twisted’ and ‘abusive’ scenes with an actor who might have ‘relished’ in those moments.</p>

      <p>The Color Purple actress added of Joe: ‘There were moments that I would have to calm him down like, “I’m fine. You’re fine because I know that you’re not going to harm me. I know that you’re not going to take advantage. We are OK. Like I had to really like let him know that we have a job to do and we’re going to be OK.</p>

      <p>‘He was lovely.’</p>
      <p>As Harriet makes her literal journey to freedom in the film, her struggle and eventual triumph of emancipation is brilliantly depicted through her hair and costume.</p>

      <p>Cynthia applauds the departments for subtly mastering the art of storytelling through Harriet’s appearance.</p>
      <p>‘Paul [Tazewell], from the beginning, used the costume to signify the growth of her and her change, and then her being an enslaved woman into being a woman who was running for her freedom, to being a woman who found her freedom, but hadn’t quite gotten stability,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>‘To a woman who is in freedom and stable now and to a woman who’s now worked up enough courage to go back again and now to another woman who becomes a hero.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘It just felt like it was moving so fluidly throughout the film, that I don’t know how we would have done it without him because I truly think that his storytelling helped my storytelling.’</p>
