      <h1>Joker Director Has a Message for Fans Following $1 Billion Box Office Record</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:11:25+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Hickson</a></address>
      <p>Now that <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker-film/">Joker</a></i> has made history by becoming the first R-rated film to earn <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-movie-1-billion-box-office/">$1 billion at the global box office</a>, director and co-writer Todd Phillips has a special message for the fans who helped make it possible.</p>
      <p>Phillips posted a video that features clips from <i>Joker</i>, as well as quotes from people on Twitter heaping praise upon the film. Comments that read with such pleasantries as, "Amazing," "So good" and "10/10" appear on-screen to describe the Clown Prince of Crime's solo film.</p>

      <p>As the video nears its end, text that reads, "$1 Billion Box Office" appears, followed by a message saying, "Thank you fans." The video then ends with a shot of the film's title card.</p>
      <p>Phillips himself also added some commentary to the video in the post's description, writing, "Wow. What a ride this has been!! Thank you to the fans!"</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> reaching $1 billion worldwide is all the more impressive considering it hit this milestone <a href="https://screenrant.com/joker-most-profitable-comic-book-movie-all-time/">without any help from the Chinese market</a>. It also <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-beats-the-dark-knight-box-office/">outperformed <i>The Dark Knight</i></a>, which has long been the standard-bearer for on-screen depictions of The Joker.</p>
      <p>Directed by Todd Phillips, <i>Joker</i> stars Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Douglas Hodge, Marc Maron, Josh Pais and Shea Whigham. <i>Joker</i> is now in theaters.</p>
