      <h1>Oromo youth threat to Ethiopia's democracy - Journalist Eskinder Nega</h1>

      <p>Eskinder Nega, an award-winning Ethiopian journalist and political activist says politically active young men in the country’s largest and most populous region, Oromia, are a threat to the country’s stability.</p>
      <p>Publisher of the Ethiopis newspaper is currently in Washington DC to hold an engagement. He has dubbed his address as a report from the frontline with a promise to expose the activities of Oromo youth known as Qeerroo.</p>
      <p>He suggested that the activities of Qeerroo were dangerous to the extent that there was the need for the international community to speak up on the looming threat.</p>
      <p>Nega in a Twitter post last week compared the Qeerroo to interahamwe, the rampaging youth wing of Rwanda’s erstwhile ruling party. They were said to have played a key role in the 1994 genocide in the East African country.</p>
      <p>Now leading a political movement, Nega has repeatedly taken a swipe at the Qeerroo movement which is allied with a leading Oromo activist, media mogul and now politician, Jawar Mohammed.</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/13/freedom-oromo-activists-qeerroo-ethiopia-standstill">March 2018 UK Guardian</a> piece on the political impact of Qeerroos in bringing Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to power explained the term as follows: “In traditional Oromo culture the term denotes a young bachelor.</p>
      <p>“But today it has broader connotations, symbolising both the Oromo movement – a struggle for more political freedom and for greater ethnic representation in federal structures – and an entire generation of newly assertive Ethiopian youth.”</p>
      <p>In the lead up to the resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn and the election of Abiy as PM, the group were seen as drivers of anti-government actions across Oromia, from activation of social shutdowns through to rallying protesters.</p>
      <p>The impact of Jawar Mohammed – characterized now as a former ally turned foe of PM Abiy – on the young activists is profound as most people see him as their leader.</p>
      <p>On social media, sentiments have also risen over the role of Qeerroo in ethnically-tinged unrest that has recently rocked the Oromia region. People have routinely called on the authorities to crackdown on the activities of the group.</p>
