      <p>Actor Daniel Craig has been tipped to direct the next <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bond/">James Bond</a> film.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old is believed to be playing the iconic spy for the final time in the upcoming ‘No Time to Die’, but producer Barbara Broccoli is keen to have Craig in the director’s chair on the next movie in the franchise.</p>
      <p>Craig, who will be donning Bond’s tuxedo for the fifth time in the next Bond blockbuster, has seen his creative influence increase as his time in the role has grown.</p>
      <p>It is also believed that he was instrumental in getting <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fleabag/">Fleabag</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/james-bond-didnt-need-make-no-time-die-feminist-phoebe-waller-bridge-clears-role-new-007-movie-11066029/"> creator </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/phoebe-waller-bridge/">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> to co-write the script for the 25th 007 film.</p>
      <p>A source told the Mail on Sunday newspaper: ‘Daniel has been the driving force behind ‘Bond 25’. He is determined to go out in style.</p>
      <p>‘He hired Phoebe and he’s been closely involved in every aspect of this film, from the script and development of the characters.</p>

      <p>‘Daniel is so in tune with the character and has been saying Bond has to grow and change to fit the times.’</p>
      <p>Craig previously promised he has pulled ‘out all the stops’ to make No Time To Die his best 007 movie ever.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I’d like to give you a breakdown of my week, but people would just think I was complaining.</p>
      <p>‘But every day has an intensity to it. We’re trying to make the best f***ing Bond movie we can. Pulling out all the stops.</p>

      <p>‘If we aim for the stars, we might hit the treetops.’</p>
      <p>Daniel admits he feels ‘privileged’ to have got Phoebe, 34, onboard for the project.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I had my eye on her ever since the first Fleabag.</p>
      <p>‘Then I saw Killing Eve and what she did with that and just wanted her voice.</p>
      <p>‘It is so unique – we are very privileged to have her on board.’</p>
