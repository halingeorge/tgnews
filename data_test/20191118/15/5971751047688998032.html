      <p>Nokia is empowering the 5G network of Finland’s operator Elisa. Harri Holma from Nokia just demonstrated how great the download speeds over Elisa’s 5G network will be in the city of Espoo, Finland. The maximum speed achieved was greater than 1.14 Gbps, which is crazy when compared to the speeds we currently have with 4G networks. One gigabyte can be downloaded in just 10 seconds, and that sounds great. Nokia’s engineers did a good job.</p>

      <p>The speed probably won’t be that high when we all transfer to 5G smartphones, but 300 Mbps and higher would be great. The demo was probably done on ZTE Axon 10 Pro 5G since Elisa is currently offering that device together with Huawei Mate 20 X 5G and<br/>OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. Hopefully, we’ll be seeing a 5G Nokia device listed on their web page dedicated to 5G devices and interfaces.</p>
