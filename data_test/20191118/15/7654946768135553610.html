      <h1>Jeffrey Epstein accuser claims he hid pinhole cameras to monitor ‘private moments’</h1>

      <p>One of Jeffrey Epstein’s accusers claims he installed tiny pinhole cameras throughout his Manhattan townhouse as part of an advanced surveillance system to monitor his victims’ “private moments.”</p>
      <p>Maria Farmer, who alleges she was recruited in 1996 into Epstein’s sex trafficking operation, said the pedophile financier himself showed her the extensive hidden camera system inside his Upper East Side mansion.</p>
      <p>“The main thing he did when I walked in, and I thought was interesting, he showed me where the cameras, the men monitoring everything, were,” Farmer said during her first <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-maria-farmer-says-his-house-under-constant-tv-surveillance/">TV interview Monday on “CBS This Morning.”</a></p>
      <p>She said Epstein had a media room behind a hidden door where he kept stacks of TVs playing surveillance feeds.</p>

      <p>“So, if you’re facing the house, there’s a window on the right that’s barred,” Farmer said. “That’s the media room, is what he called it. And so, there was a door that looked like an invisible door with all this limestone and everything. And you push it, and you go in. And I saw, all the cameras, it was, like, old televisions basically, like, stacked.”</p>
      <p>Farmer said the surveillance system — which included tiny pinhole cameras — appeared to be monitoring the home’s bedrooms and bathrooms.</p>
      <p>“I looked on the cameras, and I saw toilet, toilet, bed, bed, toilet, bed,” Farmer said. “I’m like, ‘I am never gonna use the restroom here and I’m never gonna sleep here,’ you know what I mean? It was very obvious that they were, like, monitoring private moments.”</p>
      <p>Farmer is <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/epstein-accuser-says-ghislaine-maxwell-made-death-threat-after-she-reported-abuse/">suing Epstein’s estate</a> alongside co-accusers Annie Farmer — her younger sister — and Teresa Helm for $557 million in damages, citing battery and emotional distress.</p>
      <p>In the suit, Farmer claims she was sexually assaulted by the pedophile when she was a 26-year-old aspiring artist.</p>
