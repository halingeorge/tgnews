      <h2>'Tidying Up' star opens online store</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:15:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Hanna Ziady, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Marie Kondo rose to fame by urging people to rid their homes of items that don't "spark joy." Now, she's recommending products that do just that, at least for her.</p>
      <p>The star of the Netflix series "Tidying Up with Marie Kondo" has launched an online shop on her website, KonMari.com, which carries products that "spark joy for Marie."</p>
      <p>There are more than 100 products for sale including a Shiatsu Stick ($12) handcrafted by Japanese woodworkers and a pair of leather slippers ($206) handmade in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>The shop, which only ships to the United States, is organized across seven categories: aromatherapy, bath, books, cooking and kitchen, d√©cor and living, tabletop and entertaining, and tidying and organization.</p>
      <p>The opening of the online shop on Monday was first reported by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marie-kondo-adds-an-e-commerce-shop-to-her-site-11574053200">Wall Street Journal</a>. Representatives for Kondo did not immediately respond to questions from CNN Business.</p>
      <p>The most expensive item for sale is a $275 brass kitchen utensil holder designed by Japan's Oji Masanori. There's also a linen Kimono robe for $115, an oil diffuser for $119 and a candle by Brooklyn-based Bellocq for $86.</p>
      <p>The cheapest product is a<a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/tabletop-entertaining/products/konmari-table-notary-ceramics-ceramic-chopstick-rest"> ceramic chopstick rest </a>for $8 (the chopsticks themselves cost $10). Other items for sale include serving bowls, dinner plates, glasses and pitchers.</p>
      <p>In an<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marie-kondo-adds-an-e-commerce-shop-to-her-site-11574053200"> interview</a> with the Journal, Kondo said she is not encouraging "over-purchasing anything."</p>
      <p>"What's most important to me is that you surround yourself with items that spark joy. If the bowl that you're using currently sparks joy for you, I don't encourage replacing it at all," she told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Her plan is to eventually include video footage of the items in the online store. For instance, Kondo told the Journal she wants to feature a video of her conducting a tea ceremony using the products and explaining how they create a calming effect.</p>
      <p>Kondo began her tidying consulting business as a 19-year old student in Tokyo. She is author of the bestselling book, "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up."</p>
      <p>Yet she is best known for the Netflix series, which sparked a global wave of house cleaning (and binge watching) earlier this year.</p>
