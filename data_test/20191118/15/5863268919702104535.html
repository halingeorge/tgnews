      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Prime Minister Imran Khan has on Monday affirmed that those politicians who are seeking NRO live in fool’s paradise and reiterated to bolster the rule of law, Dunya News reported.</p>
      <p>According to details, the premier resumed his official activities after taking a two-day break and held individual meetings with Special Assistant on Overseas Pakistanis Sayed Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Dr. Babar Awan and Member National Assembly Aamir Liaquat Hussain in Bani Gala.</p>
