        <b>Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) is set to be overwhelmed tonight as the extent of the damage caused by her baby secret with Keanu Taylor (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/danny-walters/">Danny Walters</a>) hits home in EastEnders. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/eastenders-fans-blown-away-terrifying-car-crash-stunt-mel-left-dead-11087187/">Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) is dead</a> and now Lisa has not only told Phil (Steve McFadden) that the baby isn’t his – but she is also convinced that Sharon killed Mel.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Mel having escaped from the exploding car thanks to Sharon’s help, Lisa is not believing that she then walked in front of a lorry and is convinced that Sharon pushed her in order to preserve her secret.</p>
      <p>As Sharon angrily denied this, Phil was left with food for thought and Sharon has some firefighting to do this evening as the drama in Walford continues. But have Lisa’s words got through to Phil or can Sharon convince her husband that she is completely wrong, perhaps blaming her ill health in the process?</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Sharon is indeed innocent of killing Mel – but the truth about her pregnancy is one that she will do anything to cover up as she is determined not to have her family destroyed. As the locals reel from the aftermath of Mel’s death and raise a glass, Lisa’s claims that Sharon is a murderer cause shockwaves.</p>
      <p>As a showdown ensues, will the full truth come to light or is Lisa about to be another casualty in the crossfire of Sharon and Keanu’s illicit secret?</p>
      <p>There is still plenty more drama to come over the course of the next couple of months as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/08/eastenders-spoilers-boss-kate-oates-reveals-christmas-and-35th-anniversary-plans-10618810/">Phil will have discovered the shocking truth about the affair and the baby</a> by Christmas – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/eastenders-spoilers-christmas-death-keanu-taylor-danny-walters-exits-11028412/">leading to an explosive exit for Keanu.</a></p>

      <p>Fans are predicting that Keanu will die <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/eastenders-spoilers-keanu-taylor-shot-dead-martin-fowler-christmas-11033980/">after pictures emerged of a shootout with Martin Fowler</a> (James Bye), who has recently been working for Ben (Max Bowden).</p>
