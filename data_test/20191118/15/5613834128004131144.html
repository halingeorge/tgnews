      <p>Back in 1978, <b>Kyle Richards</b> played a young Lindsey Wallace in John Carpenter’s <i>Halloween</i>, one of two kids Laurie Strode is tasked with babysitting on Halloween night. Richards, who has since become known for “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” will be reprising the role of Lindsey Wallace in <b><i>Halloween Kills</i></b>, co-starring with<b> Jamie Lee Curtis</b> once more.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jamie-lee-curtis-raves-over-kyle-richards-work-in-halloween/">US Weekly</a>, Curtis raves about Richard’s performance in next year’s film.</p>
      <p>“<i>She is so great that it’s going to be so fun for her audience — who is now used to knowing her for her TV show</i>,” the legendary scream queen told the outlet.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“They are going to be so happy to see her be an actress again, and she is absolutely fantastic.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Curtis continued, “<i>[She’s] so beautiful that, you know, she gets very decomposed. Not…you know what I mean. Like, distressed in this movie, in every way. Emotionally, physically, environmentally, and she just completely left that other life and just came and shot for three, four weeks and was amazing. <b>People are going to be bonkers about her</b>.</i>”</p>
      <p><i>Halloween Kills</i> will arrive in theaters on <b>October 16, 2020</b> followed by <i>Halloween Ends</i> on<b> October 15, 2021</b>, with <b>David Gordon Green</b> returning to direct both films.</p>
