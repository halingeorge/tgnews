      <p>Walmart-owned Sam’s Club has appointed Kathryn McLay to serve as president and chief executive officer, replacing John Furner, who this month succeeded the departing Greg Foran as Walmart U.S. CEO, <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/sams-club-names-new-ceo">Fox Business</a> reported on Friday (Nov. 15).</p>
      <p>McLay joined <a href="https://www.walmart.com/">Walmart </a>in 2015 as the vice president of U.S. finance and strategy and was promoted to senior VP of supply chain. In 2018, she was named executive VP of neighborhood markets, where she led the growth and overall operations of nearly 700 Neighborhood Markets across the U.S.</p>
      <p>“Kath has a track record of success in every role she has taken on. Her ability to deliver results today, develop a vision for the future and lead the change necessary to achieve it is compelling. She is curious and courageous,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.</p>
      <p>Before Walmart, McLay served for 14 years at Australian retailer Woolworths, most recently the general manager of replenishment from October 2012 through March 2015, <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/executive-changes/walmart-names-kathryn-mclay-sam-s-club-ceo">Supermarket News</a> reported.</p>
      <p>She is the second female executive to lead <a href="https://www.samsclub.com/">Sam’s Club</a> after Rosalind Brewer, who held the role prior to Furner, according to <a href="https://chainstoreage.com/walmart-names-new-ceo-sams-club">Chain Store Age</a>.</p>
      <p>Sam’s Club reported revenues of $59 billion in 2018, with 100,000 associates and almost 600 clubs. According to financial statements released on Nov. 14, Walmart beat Wall Street forecasts from August through October.</p>
      <p>Profits also topped analysts’ predictions, at $3.29 billion over the anticipated $3.1 billion. A <a href="https://www.refinitiv.com/en">Refinitiv</a> survey indicated that adjusted earnings came in at $1.16, more than the forecasted $1.09 average.</p>
      <p>Sam’s Club, Walmart’s $59 billion warehouse club division, operates 599 warehouse club stores, including 572 pharmacies, across the United States and Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/healthcare/2019/walmarts-sams-club-introduces-bundled-healthcare-benefits/">In September</a>, Sam’s Club announced it is partnering with Humana and other companies to offer members in Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina discounts on healthcare services, including primary care and dental services. The Sam’s Club healthcare pilot follows Walmart’s announcement that it has opened a Walmart Health clinic in Georgia.</p>
      <p>The Dallas, Georgia location will reportedly provide patients with low-cost, comprehensive care, including services for mental health.</p>
