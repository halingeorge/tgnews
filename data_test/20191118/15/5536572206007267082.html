      <p>In Fresno, California, there was a large group of family and friends gathered Sunday to watch football when a gunman suddenly walked up and started shooting at them. That person took the lives of four young men and wounded six others, police stated.</p>
      <p>There was about 35 to 40 people at that house, and that includes children, when the suspect began shooting into the crowd. That suspect is on the loose.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/us/fresno-mass-shooting-football-party/index.html">CNN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Somebody came up on foot, possibly at least one suspect and began firing,” Fresno Deputy Police Chief Michael Reid said. “They fired into the backyard where most of the people were in this party, striking 10 people.”<br/><br/>First-responders arrived at the home around 8 p.m. after receiving multiple 911 calls and found “three people down” and several suffering gunshot wounds, Reid told reporters. Officers immediately began performing CPR.<br/><br/>There was no immediate indication the suspect knew the victims, Reid said. There was also no indication the shooting was gang-related, “but that’s something that we’re going to look at,” he said.”</blockquote>
      <p>Three of the men, who were described as Asian men between the ages of 25 and 30 years old, were pronounced dead at the scene, while the 4th victim was transported to Community Regional Medical Center where he died of his injuries.</p>
      <blockquote>“My heart goes out to the families that are victims of this senseless violence,” Reid said. “We are going to do everything we can to find out who the perpetrators are and bring them to justice.”</blockquote>
      <p>There was no history of calls for service at the home where the shooting took place, Reid said.</p>
      <p>Officials do not believe it was gang-related at this point, but they have not ruled it out.</p>
