      <p>People looking for love online are being warned to be wary of scammers.</p>
      <p>Stewartry police have received reports of a dating app version of a notorious racket known as the Spanish inheritance scam.</p>
      <p>It involves messages being sent through seemingly genuine accounts on online dating websites asking for help with legal matters.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Colin Scott, who is based in Castle Douglas, said: “The victim will receive messages over a period of a month or so then receive a message saying they need help getting access to an inheritance in court.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“They will never ever meet, there will always be a reason why they cannot meet.”</p>
      <p>Sergeant Scott said this was the first incident of the scam he was aware of through dating websites but had recently dealt with a more traditional version of the fraud when a local resident handed in a letter supposedly received from a Spanish solicitor.</p>
      <p>The message said a rich person of British nationality with the same surname as the recipient has died in Spain with no known living relatives.</p>
      <p>The “solicitor” then invites the intended victim to act as heir to the deceased’s estate in return for a 50 per cent share of a multi-million dollar fortune.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sergeant Scott said: “The fraudsters say if you pretend to be the living relative they can do all the paperwork.</p>
      <p>“You get half the inheritance and they get the other half.</p>
      <p>“They ask you to send a small deposit that will release the funds.</p>
      <p>“Then the cash demands escalate from there.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">“It is, of course, a complete scam.”</a>
