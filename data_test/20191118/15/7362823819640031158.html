      <p>This was an unlikely catch of the day.</p>
      <p>Three children in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/germany">Germany</a> fished ammunition from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/world-war-two">World War II</a> out of a pond over the weekend after using a "strong magnet," according to local police.</p>
      <p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe">Thuringia</a> said on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe">Facebook</a> the incident happened Saturday afternoon when the children were fishing from a pond near Wölfis.</p>
      <p>When they discovered what was hanging at the end of their line, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">police</a> said "they carefully discarded the ammunition and promptly informed" the authorities.</p>

      <p>The incident sparked a large emergency response, with police cordoning off the area as they took care of the proper disposal of the items.</p>
      <p>Photos released by police show the rusted condition of the World War II-era items.</p>

      <p>No one was injured, but officials said it served as a reminder not to pursue such hobbies as collecting historical items.</p>
      <p>"There is a very high risk of being injured or even killed when finding ammunition and ordnance," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Polizei.Thueringen/posts/2580620038694012">police said</a>.</p>

      <p>More than 70 years after the end of the War, unexploded bombs keep turning up in Germany. Disposing of them sometimes has entailed large-scale precautionary evacuations.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, officials in Frankfurt had to evacuate about 16,500 people after a 1,100-pound American bomb was discovered during construction work.</p>

      <p>The Thuringia police force said Monday that weapons and ammunition from World War II that are discovered should be considered life-threatening and that the longer the weapons are in the ground "the more dangerous they become."</p>
      <p>Officials also stressed that the size and shape of the munitions have nothing to do with how dangerous they are.</p>
      <p>"When locating munitions — do not touch and leave at the site!" <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Polizei.Thueringen/posts/2580620038694012">police said</a>. "Weapons are extremely sensitive to touch, shock or change in their position!"</p>
