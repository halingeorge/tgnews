      <h1>Chick-Fil-A to Stop Donating to Anti-LGBTQ Organizations</h1>

      <p>Chick-Fil-A is definitely known for their chicken sandwiches, and have faced some competition recently with Popeyes and their now-infamous chicken sandwiches. However, Chick-Fil-A and their stance against the LGBTQ community has also become a focus of the public. Now, the company has come out to say they will no longer be donating to companies that have an anti-LGBTQ stance.</p>
      <p>The COO of the company issued a statement saying, “here’s no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are. There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message.” The company will reportedly no longer be giving money to the Paul Anderson Youth Home, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and the Salvation Army.</p>
