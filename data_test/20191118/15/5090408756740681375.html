      <p>Jeffree Star celebrated his recent birthday with some of his favorite things: friends, family, and lots of marijuana.</p>
      <p>The beauty mogul turned 34 on Friday, and attended a birthday party held in his home state of California. Fellow YouTubers like Shane Dawson and Ryland Adams were in attendance, as was Star’s longtime boyfriend, Nathan Schwandt.</p>
