      <p>A 19-year-old man accused of stabbing several people outside a Halloween party, fatally wounding one of them, appeared briefly on a video teleconference screen in a College Park courtroom on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Toronto police were called to a house at 22 Madison Avenue, north of Bloor Street, shortly before midnight on Oct. 31 for a report of three people stabbed outside.</p>
      <p>Investigators said two people became angry outside the home after being denied entry to a Halloween party inside.</p>
      <p>They both forced their way in, slashing and stabbing people inside, and then outside as they were leaving, police said.</p>
      <p>Officers arrived at the party to find three people suffering from stab wounds.</p>
      <p>A further search of the area led them to locate two other victims suffering from minor injuries.</p>
      <p>One of those stabbed, 19-year-old Firdous Nabizada, died in hospital on Nov. 2.</p>
      <p>One suspect, later identified as Jacob Alves, 19, was detained by police roughly an hour after the altercation began.</p>
      <p>A second suspect, a 15-year-old girl from Richmond Hill who cannot be identified per the terms of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, was arrested some time later.</p>
      <p>Alves appeared at College Park via video link on Monday.</p>
      <p>His case was put over until the morning of Dec. 2.</p>
      <p>He faces charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, assault with a weapon and weapons dangerous.</p>
