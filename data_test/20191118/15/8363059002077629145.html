      <p>John Lewis is giving away a free pair of OnePlus Bullets Wireless In-Ear Headphones with the OnePlus 7 Pro right now.</p>
      <p>The headphones are being bundled up with the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/oneplus-7-pro-review-good-display/">OnePlus 7 Pro</a>, available from the retailer in <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/oneplus-7-pro-smartphone-android-6-67-inch-4g-lte-sim-free-8gb-ram-256gb-almond-oneplus-bullets-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black-red-bundle/p238433259">Almond</a>, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/oneplus-7-pro-smartphone-android-6-67-inch-4g-lte-sim-free-8gb-ram-256gb-mirror-grey-oneplus-bullets-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black-red-bundle/p238433260">Mirror Grey</a>, and <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/oneplus-7-pro-smartphone-android-6-67-inch-4g-lte-sim-free-8gb-ram-256gb-nebula-blue-oneplus-bullets-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black-red-bundle/p238433258">Nebula Blue</a>, and <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/oneplus-bullets-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black-red/p4809115">usually retail at an hilarious £69</a> on their own. So you'll only be forking out £599 for just the handset, which isn't too bad if you're after a decent pair of wireless in-ear headphones but don't want to spend any actual money on them.</p>
      <p>The earbuds are the original Bullets from last year, as opposed to this year's refresh, but as we mentioned <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/oneplus-bullets-wireless-vs-bullets-wireless-2-whats-the-difference/">in our comparison</a>, there aren't too many differences, and if you already own the first generation of earbud, an upgrade would be pretty pointless, so as a freebie with a new smartphone, it's not too shabby.</p>
      <p>John Lewis doesn't say how long the deal is on for, but considering we're in the throes of Black Friday sales, we imagine it'll be good for a week or so at least.</p>
