          <p>During the 10th match of the ongoing third season of the T10 League between Karnataka Tuskers and Deccan Gladiators in Abu Dhabi, Karnataka Tuskers fast bowler Shapoor Zadran “pushed” Deccan Gladiators opening batsman after dismissing him.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the penultimate delivery of the second over when Shahzad’s attempt of playing a big shot off Zadran saw him missing the ball altogether. In what was a straight delivery, it ended up hitting the stumps.</p>

                      <p>Chasing a 111-run target, Gladiators sealed the chase in the penultimate over on the back of all-rounder Kieron Pollard scoring a match-winning 45* (22) with the help of one four and four sixes. All the four sixes hit by Pollard came off a Sandeep Lamichhane over as he hit the 19-year old spinner for 30 runs in his second over.</p>
                      <p>It was Gladiators captain Shane Watson who won the toss and put Karnataka in to bat. In their allotted quota of 20 overs, Tuskers scored 110/3 in 10 overs. Opening batsman Johnson Charles had top-scored for them with 35 (18) with the help of five fours and a six.</p>
