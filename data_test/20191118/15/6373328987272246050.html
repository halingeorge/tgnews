      <p>Kylie Cosmetics, founded by the 22-year-old in 2015, turned the Kardashian-Jenner sister into a mogul.</p>
      <p>Valued at a whopping $1.2 billion, Coty plan to capitalise on the self-made billionaire’s star power (as witnessed by the recent <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/viral/kylie-jenner-trademarks-rise-and-shine-after-meme-breaks-new-records/">Rise and Shine</a> riffraff).</p>

      <p>While Kylie will remain the face of the business, the cosmetics maker – whose brands include Hugo Boss and Burberry fragrances, as well as Covergirl, Rimmel and Max Factor – will have overall responsibility. The announcement has since driven shares in the company up by 5%.<br/><b>In a statement, Jenner said: </b></p>
      <blockquote>I’m excited to partner with Coty to continue to reach even more fans of Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin around the world. I look forward to continuing the creativity and ingenuity for each collection that consumers have come to expect and engaging with my fans across social media.<br/><br/>This partnership will allow me and my team to stay focused on the creation and development of each product while building the brand into an international beauty powerhouse.</blockquote>

      <p>Kylie’s first lipstick kits sold out within minutes of launching in 2015: now, she’s a social media powerhouse, with more than 150 million followers on Instagram.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Coty CEO Pierre Laubies said in a press release: </b>
      </p>

      <p>According to Coty, Kylie Cosmetics took in about $177 million in the last 12 months. The brand also reached new heights when Ulta Beauty, which operates roughly 1,100 stores, started exclusively carrying her products.</p>
