      <p>Set your phasers to fun — and mutually assured destruction! The first trailer for <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/armando-iannucci-turns-to-moscow-in-the-death-of-stalin.html">Armando Iannucci’s</a> newest HBO comedy, <i>Avenue 5</i>,<i> </i>debuted today, and the <i>Veep </i>alum is trading Capitol Hill for an equally dispiriting location with an endless supply of F-bombs: outer space. While details on the show are scarce, it stars (a beautifully bearded) <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/chance-hulu-psychological-thriller-with-issues.html">Hugh Laurie</a> as the captain of a vacation ship who has to deal with some type of engine problem, and the VIP guests are starting to get <i>pissed</i>. “This is a safe space, emotionally,” <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/silicon-valley-season-six-premiere-date.html">Space Jared</a> tells us. “Physically, obviously we’re in terrible danger.” <i>Avenue 5</i>,<i> </i>which also stars Suzy Nakamura and Josh Gad, will premiere in January.</p>
