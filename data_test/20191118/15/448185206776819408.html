      <p><b>KOHIMA:</b> The Assam Rifles, in a joint operation with Police, busted a hideout of NSCN (R) near Ramgaizang village of Cachar district, Assam on 16 November. Two active cadres of NSCN (R) and ZUF were also apprehended with one AK-56 Rifle, a large cache of ammunition and other war-like stores stated a PIB (defence wing) release.</p>
      <p>On receipt of specific input of armed cadres hiding near Ramgaizang village, Assam Rifles, on Saturday morning, swiftly launched the operation in the area. The apprehended cadres were identified as self-styled Second Lieutenant Pougonglong 28 yrs, of NSCN-R and self-styled Captain Sagu Rongmai, 40 yrs, of ZUF. Both the cadres were involved in illegal extortion, kidnapping and criminal activities in Zelianrong region (Cachar, Noney, N C Hills and Jiribam dist). The apprehended cadres were also in possession of incriminating documents revealing their association with NSCN-R faction and ZUF. These cadres carried out extortions and illegal tax collection activities which impeded the development work in the region and compounded the miseries of the local population and the business community.</p>
      <p>On successful termination of the operation, the hideout was destroyed and the cadres along with confiscated war like stores were handed over to the police for further investigation. This has come as a major relief to the locals of the area and was highly appreciated as the illegal activities by these insurgents impeded the development of the region, the release added.</p>
