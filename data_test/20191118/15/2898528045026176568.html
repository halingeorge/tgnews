      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">MMA Fighting Newswire</a></address>
      <p>The UFC is returning to Auckland, New Zealand, for the first time almost three years.</p>
      <p>Officials <a href="https://twitter.com/UFC_AUSNZ/status/1196165838916612096">announced</a> Sunday that the Octagon will make it’s third trip to Spark Arena on Feb. 23. The “City of Sails” has hosted two previous UFC events.</p>
      <p>The last time the UFC held an event in Auckland was on June 11, 2017. That show was headlined by a heavyweight out between <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/939/derrick-lewis">Derrick Lewis</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/139/mark-hunt">Mark Hunt</a>. Prior to that, the UFC made its debut in the then-Vector Arena on June 28, 2014, with a card featuring <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/512/james-te-huna">James Te Huna</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/94/nate-marquardt">Nate Marquardt</a> in the main event.</p>
      <p>No bouts have been announced for the show. A date for ticket sales is also pending.</p>
