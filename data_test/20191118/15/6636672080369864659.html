        <b>Supplyframe subsidiary company SamacSys has completed an integration with Cadence Design Systems’s Allegro and OrCAD PCB design tool suites.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This collaboration expands on the Cadence OrCAD Capture Cloud and the Allegro System Capture electrical engineering design platform by directly integrating the SamacSys platform of free design resources, including PCB footprints, schematic symbols and 3D models for more than 15 million components.</p>

      <p>“Collaborating with Cadence to integrate our eCAD model platform within their next-generation Allegro System Capture and OrCAD Capture products is extremely exciting,” said Alex MacDougall, CEO at SamacSys. “Component library management has now been extended to allow importing models into a design with a single click.</p>
      <p>Our collaboration with Cadence helps Allegro and OrCAD users save critical time during the design process.”</p>
      <p>“We wanted to make our new generation of Allegro System Capture tools as intuitive and future-proof as possible. Giving our users direct access to the SamacSys eCAD model platform within the design environment helps the design process become truly seamless,” said Dan Fernsebner, product marketing director of PCB solutions at Cadence.</p>
      <p>“Designers using the Allegro and OrCAD tools can now benefit from the convenience and confidence of accessing high-quality PCB models for components across the entire industry from SamacSys, without having to waste valuable time.”</p>
