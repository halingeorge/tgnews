      <p>A seven year-old girl died after her adopted mother beat her, starved her, burned her and gave her bleach to drink, police say.</p>
      <p>Samayah Ann Emmanuel from Miami in Florida was also made to stand for lengthy periods with her arms outstretched as if she was being crucified.</p>
      <p>And her mother Gina Emmanuel, 50, would batter the youngster with a shoe when she grew exhausted and dropped her arms.</p>
      <p>Shockingly, Gina, who is free on bail, was still a registered nurse until last week, over a year after her child’s November 2018 death.</p>
      <p>An emergency suspension was placed on her registration after it was flagged up to officials by the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237323269.html">Miami Herald. </a></p>

      <p>The alleged killer nurse was finally suspended from her job after the Department of Health cited her ‘systematic, willful and sadistic abuse and neglect of her children.’</p>

      <p>She was barred from working after the Herald detailed how Samayah was so badly malnourished that her body had ‘shriveled’ up by the time of her death.</p>
      <p>The little girl, taken into foster care after being born to a drug addict monther was covered ‘head to toe’ in bruises, burns and ‘open wounds’, according to a caller to Florida’s state-wide abuse hotline.</p>
      <p>She was burnt on the stove by Gina when she took bread to eat, it is claimed, and allegedly given bleach to drink when she complained about being thirsty.</p>
      <p>Samayah, her two sisters aged 13 and seven, as well as their five year-old brother, also had socks tied around their eyes by Gina, it is alleged.</p>
      <p>She reportedly chained her children to their beds, and warned them to lie to investigators about their injuries, according to official documents.</p>
      <p>Gina was reportedly able to get away with the abuse because adopted children are not scrutinized or supervised by social services in the same way as children in foster care.</p>
      <p>Samayah was taken out of school, and ‘did not interact with the outside world,’ according to investigators.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel was charged with aggravated child abuse, child neglect and physical neglect last month, shortly after she was arrested.</p>
      <p>She is due to be arraigned on Monday.</p>
