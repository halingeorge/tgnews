      <p>Tired of turkey or stuffing? Taco Bell is suggesting a non-traditional dish to change up the usual Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
      <p>It involves tacos, of course. The restaurant posted a <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/blog/friendsgiving-rolled-chicken-tacos-bisque-recipe">recipe for a taco soup</a> concoction on its blog which consists of throwing some tacos in a blender and adding some spices.</p>
      <p>First, though, it suggests that you start with chicken tacos. The extra ingredients include garlic, cilantro, onions and heavy whipping cream.</p>
