      <p>There are a lot of us speed freaks that get our kicks out of going fast, be that downhill or uphill. And when I say fast, I mean as fast as you want to go or as fast as you‚Äôre capable because usually, off-roading doesn‚Äôt take place on public roads, so your skill can and will be the defining factor.¬†The cool thing is now you can improve your skills and get your kicks in a more environmentally-sustainable manner.</p>
      <p>Segway, best known for well, Segways, will bring to the market their all new electric dirt bike line-up, presented earlier at SEMA, as fast as the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Their line-up will consist in two models, X260 and X160, with the X260 model being bigger, faster and offering a significantly bigger range. Both will charge in under 5 hours and offer over 40 miles of fun, and promise to be a lightweight, cost efficient and easy to maintain solution for entry level riders. All that for a price of course, starting at $3,000 for the smaller model and going up to $4,500 for the bigger one.</p>
      <p>According to Julie Tang, the Marketing Director at Segway, <i>‚Äúour core focus is to create innovative transportation solutions that will help people move around their communities ‚Äì including solutions for the urban dweller and outdoor adventurer.<br/><br/></i><i>"The popularity of electric vehicles has made its way to the biking segment and we are proud to meet the growing eco-conscious consumer demands by introducing Segway Dirt eBike, our first product focused solely on the outdoor consumer who wants a rugged and high performance dirt biking experience.‚Äù</i></p>
      <p>Modern e-dirt bikes are becoming very capable machines. Think about all that instant torque, high speed and the ‚Äòno complications‚Äô factors that comes with them. While it‚Äôs true that there‚Äôs still a lot of progress to be made, the idea to just grab the twist grip throttle and make a move for it is pretty tempting. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>Las Vegas, Nov. 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- November 5, 2019 - LAS VEGAS - Segway-Ninebot, a leading technology company in the global intelligent short-distance transportation and robotic service industries, is introducing the Segway Dirt eBike at SEMA, the automotive specialty products show in Las Vegas November 5-8, 2019.</p>
        <p>This will be the first public showcase for the Segway Dirt eBike and marks a significant expansion into a new market category: Powersports. Making two versions available, the Dirt eBike X160 and X260 are Segway‚Äôs first electric powersports products that are a hybrid between a dirt and mountain bike that offer a superior off-road experience. This week at EICMA 2019, the company has also debuted three new hybrid off-road products in the following categories ATV, UTV, SSV to build out their new Segway Powersports business unit. This, along with the new Dirt eBike is an expansion of the Segway mobility portfolio, and showcases the company's commitment to innovation and product creation over the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>The company is leveraging robotics, AI, cloud-based technologies and their 1000+ patent protected Segway self-balancing technology in order to build a diverse ecosystem of micro-mobility products that serve to redefine the future of short-distance transportation. The Dirt eBike falls under Segway‚Äôs line of personal products, including other popular micro-mobility solutions such as the Ninebot Kickscooter and Ninebot GoKart Kit.</p>
        <p>On why entering the field of Powersports, Luke Gao, CEO of Segway-Ninebot, explained, ‚ÄúIn the past two decades, Segway has been developing world-class self-balancing Personal Transporters (PT) and electric scooters used in multiple different industries. We are hoping to break our boundaries in product creations celebrating our mission of ‚Äòinnovation and exploration‚Äô. With the expertise in technology and industrial design, the PowerSports line may just be that dream come true. It is created not only to make our riders‚Äô exploration more fun and fearless but also to stand for a groundbreaking moment for the Segway brand as well.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúOur core focus is to create innovative transportation solutions that will help people move around their communities ‚Äì including solutions for the urban dweller and outdoor adventurer,‚Äù said Julie Tang, Marketing Director at Segway. ‚ÄúThe popularity of electric vehicles has made its way to the biking segment and we are proud to meet the growing eco-conscious consumer demands by introducing Segway Dirt eBike, our first product focused solely on the outdoor consumer who wants a rugged and high performance dirt biking experience.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Dirt eBike is compact, lightweight, cost efficient and easy to maintain for entry level riders. Since the audience for dirt bikes is broad, the product is enabling more people to experience exciting off-road adventures that formerly were beyond reach. Compared to traditional gas dirt bikes, Segway Dirt eBike takes full advantage of its electric powered construction resulting in lighter weight without sacrificing performance. Two versions will be available; the major differences are size and driving range. The X260 is a larger bike and has a greater off road mileage range (74.6 miles versus the X160‚Äôs 40.4 miles); both Dirt eBikes allow users to personalize their bikes with standard motor parts.</p>
        <p>For product specs and key features for X260 and X160 see this link. Retail pricing for the new Segway Dirt eBikes will be the following: X160 for $2,999.99 and the X260 for $4,499.99. Product availability for consumers will be in Q1 2020.</p>
        <p>In 2018, Segway launched three products including Ninebot Gokart Kit on Indiegogo crowdfunding site with record breaking funding exceeding more than $3.5 million. In July 2019, Segway-Ninebot again revolutionized urban mobility space with its Ninebot Kickscooter MAX campaign, exceeding more than $4 million. Riding on this campaign success, there will be an Indiegogo campaign for Segway Dirt eBike that kicks off November 25. Sign ups start the first day of SEMA, November 5, that includes early-bird deals of up to $500.</p>
        <p>At SEMA, there will also be a miniature race track for event attendees to experience first-hand the future of transportation with the Segway Dirt eBike and Ninebot Gokart. Visit Segway‚Äôs Outdoor Experience Track located in outdoor booth #80001 at Westgate Hotel Lot and more products will be available in indoor booth #51123 at Performance Pavilion located next to the Las Vegas Convention Center of the South Hall.</p>
