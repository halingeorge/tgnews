      <p>Council bosses condemned a Christmas lights switch-on after families hit out at the 'dangerous' event.</p>
      <p>Sandwell Council issued a statement after furious families said what should have been an evening of festive fun left them terrified of being crushed to death.</p>
      <p>Thousands of revellers turned out for the big switch-on in Blackheath last Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>But some branded the event a "car crash" and an "utter disgrace".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One said they feared for their life because of alleged overcrowding.</p>
      <p>They said: “I actually thought me and my baby was going to die at one point! We was getting crushed and pushed and I looked around with no way out of the crowd was horrible and stressful and couldn’t even see the lights turn on! Terrible organisation. I go every year!”</p>
      <p>Another added: “People with disabilities were very at risk no consideration to their safety! Children and babies likewise at risk! Shocking! Sandwell you should be ashamed for breaching so many health and safety policies and abusing children, families and people with disabilities!”</p>
      <p>And a third wrote: “Absolutely awful! Really embarrassing for the community and the town.</p>
      <p>“Squashed like a tin of sardines, unable to move and rally dangerous!</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anyone was hurt, but if they was then there’d be a lot of questions asked.</p>
      <p>“Awful wish I would have gone to Halesowen.”</p>
      <p>A fourth wrote: "Think you need to have a word with whoever organised the Christmas lights turn on up blackheath. Downright dangerous! Crammed into an extremely small space with no crowd control at all. An open bar plotted in the middle of what is supposed to be an event for the kids, and using live goldfish as prises for games."</p>
      <p>Event organiser Walk Works CIC, which has overseen the event for three years, said the switch-on had been scaled back.</p>
      <p>A Sandwell Council spokesman said: "We’ve received lots of complaints about Saturday’s Blackheath Christmas lights switch-on event.</p>
      <p>"We have arranged an urgent meeting with the organisers to discuss the concerns people have raised around safety and other matters.</p>
      <p>"We want these events to be a huge success for everybody to get into the Christmas spirit and we’re sorry to hear that this event fell well short of expectation.”</p>
