      <p>A group of 226 Cuban <b>doctors</b> are returning from <b>Bolivia</b> to <b>Cuba</b> after a decision by the Havana authorities taken due to a change in <b>Bolivia</b>'s governance, according to BGNES.</p>
      <p>Rolando Millares, Interpol's Bolivian spokesman, said a plane with 226 Cuban nationals had flown to <b>Cuba</b>, adding that all the passengers were <b>doctors</b> returning to Cuba.</p>
      <p>The group is part of 726 Cubans sent by Havana authorities to help Bolivia.</p>
      <p>So far, <b>Cuba</b> and Venezuela have been the biggest regional allies of left-wing representative Evo Morales, who resigned as Bolivian president a few days ago, and power was taken over by right-wing Senator Jeanine Áñez, who immediately recognized Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaidó who enjoys US support.</p>
