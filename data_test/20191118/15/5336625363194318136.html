      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> Save an extra 15% on <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdqt">Alienware M15</a> gaming laptops with the code AW15.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Gamers are a demanding bunch, and they need to be because if a device can't keep up, it's going to seriously affect the experience of everyone involved.</p>
      <p>There are a number of top gaming brands that consistently deliver devices that impress even the most demanding of customers. We're talking about the likes of Logitech, Corsair, Razer, and of course, Alienware. There is no brand with quite the same reputation as Alienware when it comes to performance, and that's why it doesn't come cheap.</p>
      <p>There are two things you know for sure with Alienware: It's going to perform and it's going to be expensive. This is why it pays to wait until Black Friday to invest in a device from this brand.</p>
      <p>You can now save an extra 15% on <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdqt">Alienware M15</a> gaming laptops with the <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdqt">code AW15</a>. This is possibly the best deal from the Dell Black Friday pre-sale, that has been up and running for a while now. It's worth checking out the full range of discounted laptops and desktops, with potential savings of up to £440.</p>
      <p>Demand the best and save on Alienware in the Dell Black Friday pre-sale.</p>
