      <h1>2020 Chevrolet Colorado RS isn't what you think it is</h1>
      <h2>Chevrolet unveils the Colorado RS, but it's no performance model</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:12:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/anton-andres.html" target="_blank">Anton Andres</a></address>
      <p>When we hear the letters R and S put together, we typically imagine a sportier version of a car, be it a high-performance model, or a slightly breathed over variant. So putting the RS designation on the Chevrolet Colorado, naturally, made a curious. A sport truck possibly?</p>
      <p>Well, it's nothing like you would imagine. It's no rally raid-inspired truck, nor is it aimed to go up against, say, the Ford Ranger Raptor. It's actually far from that. Instead, the Colorado RS is an appearance package for the 'low-rider' configuration of the said pickup. So, what makes it an RS then?</p>

      <p>Available in either crew cab (four-door) or extended cab body styles, it gets a special two-tone paint job. You can pair it with red, blue, white, or orange, for as long as the second color is black. The hood, door mirrors, roof, and tailgate have been painted black to add a bit of contrast to the bright color hues. Chevrolet also deleted the rear bumper, which is an ode to the lowered sport truck trend of the 90's. We do wish Chevrolet put on a set of wider, chunkier tires to make it look even more aggressive.</p>
      <p>Chevrolet didn't mention any changes to the interior, although they did say that it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There are Aux-in and USB ports inside, as well as three 12v sockets in the crew cab body. We're expecting it to have the same interior as the standard Colorado, though.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the Colorado RS doesn't come with 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel. Instead, it uses a 2.5-liter turbodiesel that's good for 163 PS and 385 Nm of torque. Again, it would be cool if Chevrolet shoved in the 200 PS, 500 Nm 2.8-liter Duramax. It does, however, come with a six-speed manual and it's the only transmission option you get. So for those who want a low-rider pickup with a six-speed manual, the Colorado RS is for you.</p>
      <p>But that's only if you live in Thailand, that is. The Colorado RS is a limited edition model over there, and they'll only make 200 examples of it.</p>
      <p>If we were to have our way with it, we'd use the 2.8-liter Duramax, fit a larger set of alloys, and keep the six-speed manual.</p>
      <p>But that's just us.</p>
