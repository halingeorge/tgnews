      <h1>Alby Mathewson Will Bid Farewell To Munster This Weekend</h1>

        <b>Munster scrum-half Alby Mathewson will make his final appearance for the southern province this weekend in the clash with Racing 92 at Thomond Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former All Black Mathewson originally signed for Munster as short-term cover for Conor Murray who was recovering from a neck injury at the beginning of the 2018/19 season.</p>
      <p>Such was Mathewson’s quality on the pitch and popularity among the players and staff, the 33-year-old continued his stay in Limerick for the rest of the campaign and for the beginning of this season due to Murray’s involvement with Ireland at the World Cup.</p>

      <p>However, Munster have now confirmed that Mathewson will depart the province after this weekend and he looks set to make his final appearance on Saturday as Racing 92 visit Thomond Park in Round 2 of the Heineken Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>It was always unlikely that Mathewson would stay on with the southern province considering the depth that exists at scrum-half.</p>

      <p>Munster have senior scrum-halves Murray, Nick McCarthy, Craig Casey and Neil Cronin in situ while Jack Stafford is impressing in the Academy.</p>
      <p>In total, Mathewson has made 27 appearances for Munster scoring six tries.</p>
