      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-motley-crue-album-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Motley Crue</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-def-leppard-album-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Def Leppard</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-the-song-every-rose-has-its-thorn-by-poison">Poison</a> are poised to announce a US summer stadium tour, according to an online report.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/motley-crue-def-leppard-poison-set-2020-stadium-tour-913823/">Rolling Stone</a> say a source has confirmed to them that the trio will play together, although dates and venues have still to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>If true, it would mean the Crue would have to tear up the legal document they signed prior to heading out on the road in 2015. The <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/crue-to-be-sued-if-they-ever-tour-again">high profile contract said they would be sued if they ever hit the road again</a> under the Motley Crue name.</p>
      <p>The report comes after the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/motley-crue-bring-motley-crue-back"><i>Bring Back Motley Crue</i> campaign</a> was recently launched by Crue fan Motley Mann, who was looking to pick up 15,000 signatures. Motley Crue’s Twitter account briefly posted a link to the petition with the caption: “This is interesting.” However, the tweet was later removed.</p>
      <p>Rumours of a Motley Crue comeback began to swirl recently when unsubstantiated reports emerged suggesting <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/vince-neil-shoots-down-live-motley-crue-rumours-denies-spat-with-tommy-lee">a potential $150 million was on the table for a Crue live reunion</a>.</p>
      <p>However, frontman Vince Neil distanced himself from the gossip saying he hadn’t been in touch with his Motley Crue bandmates since the premiere of <i>The Dirt</i> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Motley Crue brought the curtain down on their live career when they played <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/vince-neil-s-crue-farewell-tears-were-special">an emotional farewell show in Los Angeles on New Year’s Eve 2015</a>. But they got back together in the studio in 2018 to record four new tracks for <i>The Dirt</i>, with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/will-motley-crues-reunion-be-permanent-nikki-sixx-weighs-in">bassist Nikki Sixx telling <i>Classic Rock</i> back in February there had been no decision to make the reunion permanent</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the reported tour with Def Leppard and Poison has not been confirmed by official sources.</p>
