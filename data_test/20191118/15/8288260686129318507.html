      <h1>'S***** little dance' - Aston Villa hero reveals explosive row with manager</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa news | Richard Dunne spent four seasons with AVFC but endured a poor relationship with the former Liverpool boss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:11:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Richard Dunne has revealed he 'never liked' Gerard Houllier and it led to an expletive filled row with the Frenchman whilst the pair were at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Houllier arrived at B6 in September 2010, only one year removed from the controversial play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Ireland's World Cup dreams were ended against the French, when Thierry Henry's handball led to a decisive goal in Paris.</p>

      <p>And Dunne has now claimed that there were still seriously ill-feelings when the former Liverpool boss rocked up at Bodymoor Heath.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://twitter.com/IndoSport/status/1195679601084846080?s=20">the Irish Independent,</a> Dunne said: “Do you know what I remember afterwards is Gerard Houllier skipping past our bus and doing a s***** little dance.</p>
      <p>“I remember that. And obviously he is French, but he was part of UEFA at the time and he was happy. “</p>

      <p>Asked if that animosity was still present during their spells at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> , the central defender made no bones about his feelings for his former employer.</p>
      <p>“I fell out with him a few times," he explained. "I never liked him. I never liked him since then because of that and he is the one person that I never liked because of it.</p>
      <p>“He is the one person who sort of tried to rub it in our face.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I got into trouble at Aston Villa and he called us for a meeting, me and James Collins, and he called us into the meeting and before we went in James Collins said: ‘Whatever happens, don’t react to him'.</p>
      <p>“I was like: ‘Alright, grand, grand, grand’.</p>
      <p>“He started talking and he said: ‘I don’t know if you don’t like me because I am French or because of Thierry Henry’s handball’.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“And before I could even do anything, James Collins was over the table going: ‘Shut up you f****** a*******!’</p>
      <p>“Even for him, it was still in his head.”</p>
      <p>Dunne endured a tumultuous time during Houllier's stewardship and was at one point, along with Collins fined for an altercation on a team bonding exercise.</p>
