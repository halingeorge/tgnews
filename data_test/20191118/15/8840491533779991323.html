      <p>WHEN nominations for the Mayo GAA County Board convention to be held this year in Belmullet on Sunday, December 15, closed at the weekend, there was only one nominee for the position of treasurer, Charlestown's Valerie Murphy.</p>
      <p>At the 2018 convention, outgoing treasurer Kevin O'Toole told the delegates that he would be giving just one more year to the job and that he intended to step down from the position at the 2019 convention.</p>
      <p>Mr.O'Toole didn't change his mind and as a result Mayo County Board delegates are to select Valerie Murphy as their first ever treasurer as there has been no other person nominated for the position.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile there will be a number of contests when the county delegates meet for this years convention.</p>
      <p>First up will be the position of county board chairperson.</p>
      <p>Two have been nominated for the job, current county board vice-chairman Seamus Tuohy, and Crossmolina's Liam Moffatt.</p>
      <p>Having come up through the ranks, Seamus Tuohy, who was chairman of Bord na Óg for five years before filling the position as vice chairman of the county board for the past five years, will be the odds on favourite to win this contest.</p>
      <p>Two have been nominated for the position of vice chairperson, current chairman of Bord na nÓg Con Moynihan, and present PRO Paul Cunnane. </p>
      <p>There will be no contest for secretary or assistant secretaty, as current secretary Dermot Butler and assistant secretaty Ronan Kirrane are unopposed.</p>
      <p>The new incoming assistant treasurer is Castlebar's Michael Diskin who is the only nominee for the position.</p>
      <p>There will be no contest for the central council position as Kiltimagh's Paddy McNicholas is the only nominee.</p>
      <p>However, there will be a contest for the two Connaught Council delegate positions as there are four nominees, Johnny Hopkins, The Neale, Vincent Neary, Bonniconlon, Ger McHugh, Hollymount/Carramore, and Johnny O'Malley, Ardnaree.</p>
