      <h2>Qantas UK is celebrating its centenary with some seriously cheap flights from the UK to Australia this week but you'll need to be quick if you want the best deals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:28:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>Flights to Australia aren't exactly cheap, and even if you find a deal, it can still make quite the dent in your budget.</p>
      <p>However, Qantas is giving Brits the chance to snap up some temptingly cheap flights to Australia with prices from £205pp.</p>
      <p>In fact, it's currently releasing return flights from London Heathrow to Sydney from £205pp in Economy, including taxes, in what it's dubbing its 'Golden Tickets'. </p>
      <p>You can bag the cheap £205pp returns on the <a href="https://www.qantas.com/gb/en/promotions/centenary-sale.html">Qantas website here</a> but you're going to need to time it pretty well.</p>
      <p>That's because Qantas is only releasing 20 Golden Tickets every day, as it celebrates its centenary anniversary.</p>
      <p>The tickets will be released at midday, and we imagine they're likely to be pretty popular.</p>

      <p>The first batch went on sale at midday on Monday 18th November 2019, and the other releases will continue for 100 hours, with a new set of 20 up for grabs at midday every day.</p>
      <p>In total, there are 100 Golden Tickets up for grabs.</p>
      <p>However, don't be disheartened if you don't manage to get your hands on one of the discounted return fares.</p>
      <p>As part of the centenary celebrations, the airline has also slashed prices on return flights from London Heathrow to Australian hotspots such as Sydney, Perth and Melbourne, with return fares from £699pp.</p>

      <p>You can already book the discounted returns on the <a href="https://www.qantas.com/gb/en/promotions/centenary-sale.html">Centenary Sale online</a> , but you'll need to do so by 16.30 on Friday 22nd November 2019 when the sale ends. It's also worth noting that if the deals sell out before that date, that's it for the sale.</p>
      <p>There's no doubt that 2019 has been an exciting year for Qantas, who recently operated the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/worlds-longest-dreamliner-flight-touches-20666306">world's longest Dreamliner flight</a> , a non-stop route between New York and Sydney which took 19 hours and 16 minutes.</p>
      <p>It was part of a series of research flights from the brand on board repurposed Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft for the route, which also saw a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/australia-new-zealand/first-non-stop-flight-london-20878987">direct London Heathrow to Sydney</a> route taking off earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Of course, flights could soon be a lot shorter between the UK and Australia; in fact, thanks to a new engine, flights between the two could be <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/australia-new-zealand/uk-flights-australia-could-take-20174710">just a four-hour journey</a> .</p>
