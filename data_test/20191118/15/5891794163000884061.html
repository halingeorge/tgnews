      <p>KYIV -- Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigations (DBR), a newly established law enforcement body tasked with investigating high-level crimes, has requested that former President Petro Poroshenko be stripped of immunity.</p>
      <p>In a November 18 <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/dbr.gov.ua/photos/a.935007639988210/1415502301938739/?type=3&amp;theater">statement</a></b>, the DBR said it had officially informed the Prosecutor-General's Office that Poroshenko was suspected of abuse of power and of calling for the overthrow of the government.</p>
      <p>The DBR asked the Prosecutor-General's Office to initiate the cancelation of Poroshenko's immunity in parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. The DBR gave no further details.</p>
      <p>Poroshenko, who lost the election to Volodymyr Zelenskiy in April, enjoys immunity as a lawmaker.</p>
      <p>A law establishing the rules under which the lawmakers' immunity can be lifted is expected to go into force as of January 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>The DBR said earlier that Poroshenko was possibly involved in 13 criminal cases under investigation.</p>
