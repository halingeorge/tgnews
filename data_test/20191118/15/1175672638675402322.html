      <h1>The Ranch Mine creates modern courtyard home in the Arizona desert</h1>

      <p>American studio  <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/the-ranch-mine/">The Ranch Mine</a> has completed a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/houses/">residence</a> in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> that features a mix of gabled and flat volumes wrapped in corrugated metal, white stucco and honey-toned wood.</p>

      <p>The Pleats house is located near the Dreamy Draw Mountain Preserve, just north of Uptown Phoenix. The clients – proud owners of two rescue dogs – purchased the property over a decade ago, drawn by the natural topography and open space.</p>
      <p>The site had an existing house dating to 1952, which the clients planned to renovate or replace once they found the right architect.</p>

      <p>"From the day they moved in, their goal was to remodel the house to fit their lifestyle – modern yet warm, functional yet original, minimalist yet inviting," said local firm <a href="https://www.theranchmine.com/">The Ranch Mine</a> in a project description.</p>
      <p>"After a decade of living below their means and surviving the Great Recession saving every penny they could, the homeowners reached out to us with a modest budget and big dreams."</p>

      <p>The team conceived a U-shaped dwelling that is organised around a central courtyard with a swimming pool. The foundation of the original home was retained, but the rest of the structure was demolished.</p>
      <p>"To save money, the foundation of the original house was reused and the space was redesigned to fit the bedrooms, including a master suite that was lacking before," the studio said.</p>

      <p>The three volumes that make up the 1,850-square-foot (172-square-metre) residence each have a distinct shape and function.</p>
      <p>One has a tall, pointy roof and encompasses the public zone. Adjoining this volume is a long, low bar that contains the bedrooms.</p>

      <p>The third component – a garage and workshop – also has a gabled roof. Located in the back of the property, this area is accessed via a gravel driveway that runs alongside the house.</p>
      <p>Facades are wrapped in a mix of hemlock wood, dark metal and white stucco. For the exterior aesthetic, the team took cues from the saguaro cactus, which is native to the region.</p>

      <p>"The house draws its name, Pleats, from the corrugated metal that wraps the gabled volume, reminiscent of the pleated exterior of the cactus," the studio said.</p>
      <p>"The gabled entry features a patterned, wood rainscreen that evokes the forked ribs of the cactus, while the recessed entry is akin to a saguaro boot – the holes in the giant cacti that many desert animals use as their homes."</p>

      <p>The interior provides shelter from the intense desert sun, while still offering views of the mountains and a connection to the landscape.</p>
      <p>In both the public and private areas, sliding glass doors open directly into the central courtyard, allowing for indoor-outdoor living. A large patio is covered with a perforated steel canopy that provides ample shade.</p>

      <p>"The tall roof of the gable adds additional shade to the courtyard from the intense afternoon sun," the team said.</p>
      <p>Decor and finishes draw upon multiple sources, including mid-century modern design and sleek hardware from Germany and Italy. The clients also requested the integration of industrial-style materials, such as concrete and stainless steel.</p>

      <p>"To meet this request, the hardware, fixtures and appliances were chosen for their clean and European design, while finishes like walnut cabinetry, accent lighting and furniture add some mid-century flair," the team said.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2010, The Ranch Mine is led by the husband-and-wife team of Cavin and Claire Costello. Other projects by the Arizona studio include a modern <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/03/27/weave-house-ranch-mine-phoenix/">courtyard home that alludes to Georgia O'Keeffe paintings</a>, and a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/08/03/ranch-mine-canal-house-mission-style-architecture-phoenix-america/">canal-side home that is based on the missions</a> built in the American West over 200 years ago.</p>
