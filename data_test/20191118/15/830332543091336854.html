      <h1>Will.i.am must retract racism claim or face potential lawsuit, Qantas says</h1>
      <h2>Rapper alleged he was targeted by airline employee</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:38:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author">Toyin Owoseje, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Qantas has vowed to help a member of its cabin staff take legal action against musician <a href="https://cnn.com/style/article/will-i-am-black-eyed-peas-masters-of-the-sun-smart-creativity/index.html">Willl.i.am</a> if the <a href="https://cnn.com/2018/07/11/politics/black-eyed-peas-music-video-get-it/index.html">Black Eyed Peas</a> front man does not retract his claim that he was a victim of racial discrimination.</p>
      <p><a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/16/us/will-i-am-qantas-airline-trnd/index.html">The rapper and producer alleged on Saturday that he was targeted by an "overly aggressive" female employee</a> during a flight from Brisbane to Sydney, after he left his laptop out.</p>
      <p>He said on Twitter that he couldn't hear the PA announcement instructing passengers to put away laptops and other electronics through his noise-canceling headphones.</p>
      <p>Describing the incident, the musician told his 12.8 million Twitter followers that he was mistreated by a "#RacistFlightattendant" who was "beyond rude."</p>
      <p>"I don't want to believe she (is) racist. But she has clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of color," he wrote after sharing a photo and the full name of the staff member.</p>
      <p>The singer said he was met by five police officers when the plane arrived at Sydney Airport.</p>
      <p>"I did comply quickly and politely, only to be greeted by police," Will.i.am <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195522916558852096">wrote</a>. "I think I was targeted."</p>
      <p>After initially insisting the row was a misunderstanding and rejecting any allegations of racism, <a href="https://cnn.com/videos/travel/2019/11/15/qantas-flies-london-to-sydney-on-longest-flight-richard-quest-lc-lon-orig.cnn">Qantas</a> has gone further and offered legal support to the member of staff involved in the dispute.</p>
      <p>"Absent a retraction, and if the crew member wanted to take the matter further, we'd certainly be willing to provide legal support for them to do this," a spokesperson told CNN.</p>
      <p>CNN has contacted Will.i.am's representatives for comment on the potential legal action.</p>
      <p>The singer said on Twitter that it was his responsibility to bring the issue to light after facing a backlash for naming and shaming the employee.</p>
      <p>"I am in the public eye &amp; I behave even when I have a bad day...my mother raised me to be polite &amp; treat people with respect...being a public figure puts extra guards rails so I stay polite &amp; serve...everyone should operate with respect. especially people who serve the public"</p>
      <p>The star added in an<a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/will-i-am-describes-alleged-racism-treatment-on-qantas-flight/video/a97a9518e177962bcd4a555ca11f519b"> interview with Australia's The Daily Telegraph</a> that he didn't want the crew member to lose her job over the incident but to "be retrained on how to deal with people."</p>
      <p>The Black Eyed Peas are in Australia as a part of the band's 2019-20 world tour.</p>
