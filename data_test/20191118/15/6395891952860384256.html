      <h1>T-Mobile says Sievert to become CEO in May 2020</h1>

      <p>T-Mobile says Mike Sievert will become CEO in May, following the end of John Legere's contract.</p>
      <p>The company said Monday that the move is part of its succession plan.</p>
      <p>Legere will remain with the Bellevue, Washington-company as a board member. Sievert, who has worked with Legere for the past seven years, currently serves as president, chief operating officer and a director.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile is in the midst of combining with Spring in a $26.5 billion deal. Federal regulators have approved the deal, but attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia aim to block it, saying it will raise prices for consumers. A trial is to start in December.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile has already made promises to get the deal done, including providing coverage in rural areas and not raising prices for three years.</p>
      <p>Legere joined T-Mobile as its CEO in 2012 and has been a colorful personality on Twitter and elsewhere promoting the wireless service since then.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going anywhere soon. This is all part of a multiyear plan," he wrote on the social media service, where he has 6.5 million followers.</p>
