      <p>28 people were placed in quarantine in China after a hunter was diagnosed with the bubonic plague, local health officials said.</p>
      <p>This follows two other patients being diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing last week, the most deadly form of the disease, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/resources/235098_Plaguefactsheet_508.pdf">as the CDC says it's almost always fatal if not treated quickly.</a></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/17/c_138562299.htm">According to news media Xinhua</a>, the patient hunted and consumed a wild rabbit on November 5. The CDC says a person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague within one to six days after being infected. Key symptoms include a swollen lymph node, headache, fever, chills and extreme exhaustion.</p>
      <p>The plague is the same disease that is widely believed to have led to the Black Death, the pandemic that ravaged Europe in the 14th century and killed around 25 million people, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Black-Death">according to Britannica.</a></p>
      <p>The patient is currently receiving treatment for the disease at a hospital in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Doctors say none of the 28 people quarantined are showing any concerning symptoms.</p>
