      <p>Tension prevailed for a while when JD(S) workers started shouting slogans as BJP candidate K C Narayana Gowda's car passed on the route of JD(S) rally in KR Pet on Monday. </p>
      <p>He was on his way to the taluk office to file nomination papers accompanied by his wife and daughter. One of the JD(S) worker even threw a footwear at him. </p>
      <p>Police dispersed the crowd and provided protection to Gowda, who had to walk a little distance to file the papers. Gowda had resigned from JD(S) necessitating bypolls in KR Pet.</p>
      <p>He was not allowed outside the office after filing the papers by the police as a precautionary measure. There was also heated exchange of words between the workers of BJP and JD(S).<br/> </p>
