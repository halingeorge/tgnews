      <h1>Notts County defender Alex Lacey plays in behind closed doors friendly at Nottingham Forest</h1>
      <h2>New centre-back is getting closer to gaining match fitness</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:55:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Notts County’s new defender Alex Lacey took a significant stride in his bid for fitness after he completed 60 minutes in a behind closed doors friendly at Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>The centre-back, who was substituted after an hour, recently signed a deal until the end season after leaving Gillingham last season.</p>
      <p>Lacey came through the game fine and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> are hoping to arrange another game which is likely to see the former Luton defender play closer to 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>Having not played this season, the 26-year-old   was pleased with the run-out against a Reds’ under-23s side who included some players with first-team experience.</p>
      <p>“I felt good,” he said.</p>

      <p>“It was my first game for a while, but I felt strong which was good.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been with the lads for almost a month now which has helped a lot.</p>
      <p>“It was good to be back out there.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to be with the team playing matches as soon as possible and hopefully if I get the chance I can step in and do well.”</p>
