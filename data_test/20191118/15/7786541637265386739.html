      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is back on the Supreme Court bench after missing time last week with what the court described as a stomach bug.</p>
      <p>The 86-year-old Ginsburg climbed the three steps and took her seat for a brief court session Monday. She was absent when the justices last met in public, to hear arguments on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has been treated for cancer twice in the past year, including receiving radiation for a tumor on her pancreas over the summer. She missed court sessions in January during her recovery from lung cancer surgery.</p>
      <p>Those were her first absences from court arguments in a quarter-century as a justice.</p>
