      <h1>Former KPK deputy chief Chandra Hamzah summoned by SOEs Ministry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:11:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Riska Rahman</a></address>
      <p>The State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Ministry summoned former Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) commissioner Chandra Hamzah to its office on Monday morning as the ministry is reviewing top positions at several state firms.</p>
      <p>The lawyer arrived at the ministry at 8:30 a.m. and went straight to State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir’s office, meeting deputy ministers Kartika "Tiko" Wirjoatmodjo and Budi Gunadi Sadikin as well. </p>
      <p>"There was no discussion on any position," he briefly told the press when asked about the purpose of his visit, as quoted by <i>kompas.com</i>. Former Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as Ahok, was also summoned by Erick last week to discuss a plan for the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) politician to lead a state-owned energy giant, Erick said without naming the company.</p>
      <p>Chandra, who served as deputy chairman of the antigraft commission from 2007 to 2011, was the president commissioner of state-owned electricity company PLN in 2014.</p>
      <p>"A lot [of issues] were discussed during the meeting. I was once president commissioner at PLN. I was asked about my experience there. A lot of SOEs were discussed," said Chandra, who was appointed president commissioner of state-owned mortgage lender PT Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN) in September 2015, but refused his new post to focus on the 35-gigawatt electricity generation program.</p>
      <p>The government is currently reviewing at least five strategic SOEs: Indonesia’s largest state-owned lender Bank Mandiri, BTN, state-owned mining holding company Inalum, PLN and state energy holding company Pertamina.</p>
      <p>All the companies except for Pertamina, now led by Nicke Widyawati, currently have leadership vacuums. Former Inalum president director Budi Gunadi Sadikin and former Mandiri president director Kartika were recently appointed deputy SOE ministers.</p>
      <p>PLN president director Sofyan Basir was suspended after being charged with graft. He was exonerated earlier this month. Meanwhile, former BTN president director Suprajarto resigned shortly after being assigned the position, citing irregularities in his appointment.</p>
      <p>"The discussions were [primarily about legal issues]. Minister [Erick] wants SOEs to advance. [We also looked at] what the issues are, what I encountered," Chandra said. "Don't let SOEs' executives fall into corruption cases again. Mr. Minister said integrity is of utmost importance."</p>
