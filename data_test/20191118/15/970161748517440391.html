        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> are considering a move for Reading striker Danny Loader, but will face competition from a number of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> clubs that are also interested in the youngster.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The forward has represented England at every youth level from under-16 to under-20 and made his Reading debut at just 16-years-old.</p>
      <p>Now 19-years-old, Loader has not quite made the impact with the Royals that was hoped for, scoring just one goal in 29 appearances since August 2017, although his record at youth level is excellent.</p>
      <p>He is still considered a bright prospect and is out of contract at Reading in the summer after negotiations failed to produce a new deal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/11864054/manchester-united-considering-danny-loader-bid-with-several-premier-league-clubs-also-interested">Sky Sports</a> reports that Man Utd are interested in snapping him up, but as are several other top flight sides.</p>

      <p>Wolves came very close to signing Loader in the summer before a deadline day deal fell through, with Reading pulling the plug.</p>

      <p>‘Everyone knows a Premier League club tried to sign me in the transfer window, but it wasn’t to be,’ said Loader.</p>
      <p>‘I’m very ambitious, my dream is to play on the biggest stage and you never know when these opportunities will come around again.’</p>
      <p>Reading boss Mark Bowen said earlier this month that the club are still negotiating to try and keep Loader at the Madejski Stadium.</p>
      <p>‘There are ongoing discussions between the club, him, his agent and his family,’ said Bowen.</p>
      <p>‘He is very happy with his football and yes he wants more game time but he is a great professional, has a smile on his face and works hard. That’s all I can ask for.</p>
      <p>‘He is a confident lad and has got a talent. At times he will be down but he has to be patient and he will get his chance.’</p>
