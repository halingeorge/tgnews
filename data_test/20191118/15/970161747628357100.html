        <b>What did we expect? Of course <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> playing someone who posts saucy comments on Sara Lee Bread’s social media is going to encourage his fans to do the same.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After the singer played a social media producer for the company on this week’s Saturday Night Live, hoards of horny Harry fans have mirrored the fictional comments IRL.</p>
      <p>Seems they’re really riffing on the prowess of Harry’s character Dylan, whose personal sexual proclivities, including threesomes, appeared to collide with his work duties.</p>
      <p>So, yes, the family brand has been infiltrated with a bunch of NSFW messages.</p>
      <p>Right now there stands to be an inhuman amount of ‘wreck me daddy’ comments, ‘need a real king that can handle’ and eggplant emojis to boot.</p>
      <p>Harry’s hilarious portrayal of Dylan appeared to tickle the fandom, after he commented ‘destroy me King’ on a photo of Nick Jonas.</p>

      <p>Then on a different image of a so-called ‘random fashion twink,’ Dylan, or, rather, Sara Lee Bread, commented with a string of innuendo-inducing emoji’s, which Dylan translated: ‘Getting railed to death.’</p>

      <p>In another moment, Dylan commented from the company account: ‘Feeling really depressed after threesome. What was supposed to be a fantasy ended up more rejection. Must get rid of toxic in community’, while also questioning why men ‘freak out’ when he asks them to ‘spit in his mouth’.</p>
      <p>Cue a bunch of fans today commanding Sara Lee to ‘spit in their mouth’.</p>
      <p>The brand, while admitting the comments don’t align with the family-friendly nature of the company, is ok with the added bout of attention.</p>
      <p>And why would they not be?</p>

      <p>Why, we’re hungry for some carbs as we write this sentence.</p>
      <p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/sara-lee-reacts-to-harry-styles-raunchy-snl-sketch/">The New York Post</a>, a rep for Bimbo Bakeries USA, which owns Sara Lee, said: ‘We didn’t participate in creating the skit and its content doesn’t align with Sara Lee Bread’s brand.</p>
      <p>‘But, we all know SNL pushes the envelope for laughs and we are taking it in stride.’</p>
      <p>Earlier the company had a laugh at being the centre of the skit, as the Harry Styles of real Sara Lee commented on the video:<br/>‘**checks recent activity of social media manager**’</p>
      <p>Ah, wreck us daddy.</p>
