      <p>Update 11/18/2019 3:38pm:</p>
      <p>Recently, Naturi Naughton called out 50 Cent over comments he made about a meme he posted that she didn’t like and addressed him about previously. Following that, 50 reportedly deactivated Instagram to switch over to Twitter. Now, 50 has taken to Twitter to address the situation further.</p>
      <p>50 said “LOL Im cool with all these false report, if you don’t know why something happens you can’t just make some shit up smh I turned my own IG page off SUCKERS. #LeCheminDuRoi #bransoncognac.”</p>
      <p>A fan asked 50 if he was initially sticking up for Naughton in his first tweet, and 50 responded by saying “I was sticking up for her, they just went and made some s**t up.” Take a look above.</p>
