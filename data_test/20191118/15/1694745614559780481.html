      <h1>No Laughing Matter: Joker Is the First R-Rated Movie to Make $1 Billion at the Box Office</h1>

      <p>As of this weekend, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Joker"><b>Joker</b></a> reached a milestone no other R-rated film has yet to achieve: making $1 billion at the box office. The <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/why-im-too-scared-to-see-joker-in-theaters-46678830">controversial film</a>, which previously raked in $93.5 million in its opening weekend, officially knocked <b>Deadpool</b> out of the top spot as the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time (the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Ryan-Reynolds">Ryan Reynolds</a> action-comedy pulled in $783 million), <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/15/joker-box-office-1-billion-worldwide/"><b>Entertainment Weekly</b> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to crushing this record, the controversial Todd Philips film — that follows <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/joker-movie-spoilers-46713983">the origin of Batman's most infamous foe</a> and criminal mastermind Arthur Fleck, aka <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/joker-movie-ending-explained-46723439">the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix)</a> — nabbed the highest opening weekend in October when it earned almost $94 million. Following its Oct. 4 premiere, <b>Joker</b> went on to bring in $737.5 million in its first three weekends.</p>
      <p>Although there are <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/will-there-be-a-joker-sequel-46709191">currently no plans for a sequel</a>, we'd bet this isn't the last time we'll see the villainous character onscreen.</p>
