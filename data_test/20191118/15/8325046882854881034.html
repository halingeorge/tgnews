      <p>After more than six months of protests, the tension in Hong Kong has escalated into what some witnesses are calling a “war zone”.</p>
      <p>On Monday (Nov 18) morning, a fiery stand-off between protesters in Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University and the city’s police crossed the 24-hour mark, with a resolution nowhere in sight.</p>
      <p>The siege had begun on Sunday, when police fired large amounts of tear gas and deployed water cannons while radical protesters in the university shot arrows, set fires to footbridges and entrances, threw bricks and flung petrol bombs. One police vehicle went<a href="https://news.sky.com/video/burning-hong-kong-police-vehicle-hit-by-molotov-cocktail-11863593"> up in flames</a> as a result, Sky News reported.</p>
      <p>In addition, one policeman was shot in the left calf by <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038096/hong-kong-officer-shot-arrow-police-deploy-water-cannons">an arrow</a>, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.</p>
      <p>According to SCMP, police briefly stormed the campus <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038152/hogn-kong-protests-tense-stand-between-radicals-and-police">at 5.30am</a> in effort to take control, but were met by fire and petrol bombs.</p>
      <p>PolyU president Professor Teng Jin-guang later said in a video statement that the university had secured an agreement with police to suspend the use of force “under the condition that if the protesters do not initiate the use of force, the police will not initiate the use of force”.</p>
      <p>“In addition, we have also received permission from the police for you to leave the campus peacefully, and I will personally accompany you to the police station to ensure that your case will be fairly processed,” he said.</p>

      <p>But according to The Guardian, protesters who tried to leave at 8.30am were met with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/nov/18/hong-kong-protest-police-storm-polytechnic-university-after-standoff-with-protesters-live">rounds of tear gas</a>, forcing them to retreat into the campus once more.</p>
      <p>In a later tweet, Hong Kong Police Force said that “a large group of masked rioters” had at 8am emerged from the university and “suddenly charged at police cordons, many holding petrol bombs”. Tear gas was fired as a result, it said.</p>

      <p>An acting president of the student union, Ken Woo, was reported by SCMP as saying at 11:46am that <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038152/hogn-kong-protests-tense-stand-between-radicals-and-police">over 600 people</a> were still trapped in the university.</p>
      <p>At around the same time,the Hong Kong Police Force said in a tweet that people inside the university should “drop their weapons and dangerous items, remove their gas masks” and leave via a specifically chosen exit in “an orderly manner”.</p>
      <p>“They should follow police instructions and must not charge at police cordons,” the police added.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Police later also confirmed that all protesters, even those who leave the campus, will be arrested.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters also gathered in Central and Kowloon’s Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei and Jordan to pressure police to back off on the PolyU campus.</p>
      <p>Protesters in Kowloon made barricades and walls using bricks removed from the road, debris and bamboo poles. Police then fired<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038152/hogn-kong-protests-tense-stand-between-radicals-and-police"> tear gas and sponge grenades</a> to push back protesters, SCMP reported.</p>
      <p>Around 100 people have been arrested or detained so far, the report added.</p>
