        <b>We’re on the back half of Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1. When does Chapter 2 Season 1 end and Season 2 begin? Find out here.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fortnite Chapter 2 Week 7 is almost here, which means only three weeks of challenges before the season ends. Using recent seasons as a marker, we can expect Chapter 2 Season 1 to extend one more week with some overtime challenges for additional cosmetic variants.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>After that, we’re onto Chapter 2 Season 2 and everything that will come along with it. When will this be, though? According to popular data miner <a href="https://twitter.com/Lucas7yoshi">@Lucas7Yoshi</a>, the new season will arrive just in time for Christmas.</p>

      <p>As of this writing, Chapter 2 Season 1 is set to end on December 12, 2019.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Since this is the case, we can expect a Christmas-themed season as the second season of Chapter 2 – similar to what we saw last year. We can, of course, expect to see some fan-favorite Christmas skins from years past as well.</p>

      <p>Season 2 will also likely bring some map changes to Fornite. One of the most obvious predictions is an expansion of the snow biome. Last year, we saw the ice king cover the entire map in snow. We could see something similar, or an avalanche from the mountains that covers a portion of the map.</p>
