      <p>President Donald Trump on Monday said he is “strongly” considering answering a challenge from opposition Democrats to testify in his own impeachment investigation.</p>
      <p>After the speaker of the lower house, Nancy Pelosi, upped the ante by suggesting that Trump come forward to tell the “truth,” the Republican president said he was keen.</p>
      <p>Pelosi suggested “that I testify about the phoney Impeachment Witch Hunt. She also said I could do it in writing,” Trump tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!”</p>
