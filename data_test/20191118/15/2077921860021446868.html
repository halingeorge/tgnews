      <h1>SNL Glams Up the Impeachment Hearings with Soap Opera Storylines and Jon Hamm</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:21:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">Garrett Martin  </a></address>
      <p>How did America get through the Watergate Hearings without <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Saturday+Night+Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i>? NBC’s unkillable comedy-adjacent program didn’t exit for a solid two years after those hearings kicked off, meaning an entire nation was deprived of weekly comedy sketches where celebrities in wigs enacted a bunch of surface-level observations about the unraveling of Nixon’s presidency. How informed those people must have been about what was actually happening in the hearings! It’s hard to imagine a day when American citizens were actually interested in the news and were able to get relatively unbiased reporting of such from a handful of nationally recognized media outlets.</p>
      <p>Fortunately this is the 21st century, where a decades-long plan to invalidate the authority of the mainstream news media has completely undermined the entire concept of “the truth” for a vast swath of Americans. It’s hard to imagine impeachment hearings being written off as <br/>a failure after one day because they were “boring” and lacked “pizzazz” in a world where people still cared about and believed in things. Thank god we’re all past giving a shit, huh?</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Saturday+Night+Live">Saturday Night Live</a> </i>focused on those depressing complaints in its latest episode’s recap of the impeachment hearings. Instead of just carting out a cameo from, say, <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Jon+Hamm">Jon Hamm</a>, and reeling off a bunch of jokes that conflated Ambassador Taylor with Don Draper, this week’s <i>SNL</i> carted out a cameo from <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Jon+Hamm">Jon Hamm</a> as part of a larger bit about TV networks trying to make the impeachment hearings “sexier” and more compelling for a viewing audience. Say goodbye to news coverage, and hello to <i>Days of Our Impeachment</i>, a soap opera-tinged recast of the impeachment hearings, set in a world where soap operas apparently still exist and have a following. Find out what the show has to say about Taylor, former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, the testy (and content-free) Jim Jordan, and more of the chief players from last week’s impeachment hearings. Watch the clip below or hit up <i>SNL</i>’s YouTube page for more.</p>
