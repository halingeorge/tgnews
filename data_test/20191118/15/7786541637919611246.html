      <p><b>MADRID (AP)</b> - The Latest on migration flows to Europe (all times local):</p>
      <p>4:25 p.m.</p>
      <p>European Union officials have reiterated their call for the closure of a camp in northwestern Bosnia where hundreds of migrants are living in poor conditions with almost no facilities.</p>
      <p>An EU delegation warned during a visit to the Vucjak camp that migrants staying there must be relocated to other sites as winter approaches.</p>
      <p>Michala Matuella, from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, describes the site as "shocking." She says it cannot provide "any basic accommodation and services" to migrants.</p>
      <p>Numerous international organizations have deemed the camp unfit because it is located on a former landfill and near a mine field left over from the 1992-95 war in Bosnia.</p>
      <p>Bosnia has been overwhelmed by the influx of thousands of people fleeing violence and poverty.</p>

      <p>A van carrying 52 migrants and going at high speed smashed through a border barrier between Morocco and Spain to enter the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, officials said Monday.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Interior Ministry´s office in Ceuta said the vehicle broke through a metal gate on the Spanish side of the border around 3 a.m. (0300GMT). It was not clear whether it had broken through other fences on the Moroccan side.</p>
      <p>The official said the 52 migrants were all from sub-Saharan countries. They were only identified as 34 men, 16 women and two minors. Four were treated in a Ceuta hospital for minor injuries suffered in the crossing.</p>
