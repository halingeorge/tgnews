      <p>Unai Emery's biggest mistake was trying to change things too quickly at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> when he took over from Arsene Wenger after 22 years.</p>
      <p>That's the opinion of Matthew Upson, who reckons the Spaniard may have already lost the dressing room given how poor the Gunners have been in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Emery replaced Wenger at the start of last season, but has yet to improve Arsenal, with the club failing to qualify for the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard spent big in January, with Arsenal signing Nicolas Pepe for a club-record £74million, but there has been little to show for the investment, with the Gunners floundering down in sixth - a staggering 17 points behind league leaders <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool.</a></p>

      <p>And Upson believes the players may have lost belief in their boss.</p>
      <p>"Maybe, maybe that's the case," Upson said BBC Radio 5 Live. "Maybe there's already a loss of belief or whatever it may be in the manager.</p>
      <p>"Emery came to the club and he tried to change things, he tried to be more disciplined.</p>

      <p>"Again you have to look at the recruitment, don't you? To spend what they have spent on an attacking wide player, with the other issues that need to be addressed in the team.</p>
      <p>"I thought he had a decent first season. At the end of last season you thought: 'You have to progress next season' but I don't think they have."</p>

      <p>He added: "A loss to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> [leaves Emery] in real limbo because I think he's struggling. I was at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and I saw a really poor performance from Arsenal.</p>
      <p>"It was almost like they tried to cater to not get beat at Leicester who were on top form, and this is Arsenal, and never really got any kind of grip on the game."</p>
