      <p>Jo Swinson has insisted Liberal Democrat plans to abolish business rates will “rescue the High Street”.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the CBI conference in London, Ms Swinson also said staying in the EU would deliver a £50 billion boost to the economy as she claimed the Liberal Democrats are now the “natural party of business”.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson pushed Lib Dem plans to replace business rates with a commercial landowner levy as “bold and innovative”.</p>
      <p>She said: ”The Liberal Democrats are committed to supporting small businesses who are the engine of our economy.</p>
      <p>“That’s why the Liberal Democrats would scarp business rates and replace them with a commercial landowner levy.</p>
      <p>“It will shift the burden from the tenant to the landlord so that we can breathe new life into our high streets.”</p>
      <blockquote>With the Conservatives in the pocket of Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn stuck in the 1970s, we are the only ones standing up for you<cite>Jo Swinson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Ms Swinson insisted the measure would “rescue” the High Street.</p>
      <p>“This is an innovative and bold policy that is needed.</p>
      <p>“Let’s remember what the issues are that we’re trying to solve here – businesses on the high street have been struggling for many years now and they find the business rates can be a crippling cost and this is at a time when they’re already having to deal with footfall falling, competition from online competitors where they aren’t having to pay the same type of rates.</p>
      <p>“So, I think this is an important change, and clearly it being borne by landlords – some of that may well be passed on but we also recognise it will not all be – and this will provide a significant boost for businesses.”</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said remaining in the EU would deliver a £50 billion boon to the UK economy.</p>
      <p>She said: “Boris Johnson talked of a Brexit boom this morning, but we know it is much more likely to be a Brexit bust.</p>
      <p>“We believe that being part of one of the most successful economic blocs in the world is the best guarantee we can have for our future.</p>
      <p>“For the success of our businesses and for our country, we believe that our best future is as members of the European Union.</p>
      <p>“That’s why a Liberal Democrat government will stop Brexit on day one,” she said to applause from delegates.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said without freedom of movement Labour and the Tories would struggle to fulfil their pledges.</p>
      <p>She said: “Without the European bricklayers, engineers and builders, they won’t be able to build the homes, hospitals, schools and railways they’ve promised – we can’t build it unless they come.”</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson called the Lib Dems the “natural party of business”, adding: “With the Conservatives in the pocket of Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn stuck in the 1970s, we are the only ones standing up for you.”</p>
      <p>She added that a Liberal Democrat government would introduce a “general duty of care” requiring businesses to consider their environmental impact.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader said: “We we will introduce a general duty of care for the environment and human rights for all companies and public sector agencies.”</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson added: “And we will ask all UK listed companies and private companies with more than 250 staff to have at least one employee representative on their boards.</p>
      <p>“That will help rebuild trust between workers and bosses.”</p>
