      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Thousands of people mourned Sunday night at a vigil for the teenagers who who died in a school shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, Calif.</p>
      <p>Gracie Muehlberger, 15, and Dominic Blackwell, 14, were killed Thursday when a gunman, identified by police as Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/15/Accused-suspect-in-Southern-California-school-shooting-dies/9641573823370/?upi_ss=clarita">opened fire</a> at the high school before school started. Three other students were injured in the mass shooting and are expected to survive.</p>
      <p>Central Park in Santa Clarita has become the gathering place for well-wishers and was the site of<a href="https://abc7.com/vigil-honors-victims-of-saugus-high-school-shooting/5704084/"> Sunday's vigil.</a></p>
      <p>Dominic was remembered for his smile and sense of humor. He was a cadet in the Reserve Officer Training Corps. at the school.</p>
      <p>Gracie's best friend, Addison, was wounded in the shooting but is recovering at home. She had a recorded message for the crowd.</p>
      <p>"To my friends and family and my Saugus Strong community, I really appreciate all the love and support," she said. "I'm so thankful for each and every one of you."</p>
      <p>Her bother also spoke at the vigil.</p>
      <p>"My favorite thing about you Gracie was how funny you were," Gracie's brother Riley Muehlberger said. "You were always able to put a smile on my face and that's one of the many things I'll miss the most."</p>
      <p>Berhow, who had just turned 16, walked into the school with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in his backpack and fired six shots apparently at random. He also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/16-seconds-leaves-dead-hurt-santa-clarita-high/story?id=67035523">shot himself</a> and later died in the hospital.</p>
      <p>It's been described as a planned, deliberate attack but police have not released a motive.</p>
      <p>Surveillance video shows Berhow had experience with guns and when the gun jammed he quickly fixed it and kept firing.</p>
      <p>"From the time that he withdrew the handgun from his backpack to the time that he was on the ground with a gunshot wound to his head was about 16 seconds," said Capt. Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</p>
      <p>Two of the girls who were injured know each other and "held their composure despite being shot," trauma surgeon Dr. Bois Borazjani said.</p>
      <p>The tragedy hit the whole area hard.</p>
      <p>"I have many friends at Saugus High School," said Savannah Herrera, a Valencia High School student. "We need to stop this because it has a huge impact. We can't be losing lives."</p>
      <p>Saugus High School will remain closed until Dec. 2. Other schools in the district will re-open Monday.</p>
