        <b>Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is cutting the number of flights to Hong Kong amid nearly six months of pro-democracy protests in the former British colony.</b>
      </p>
      <p>SAS said it was decreasing its five weekly flights from the Danish capital Copenhagen, the biggest airport for Denmark and southern Sweden, to four "due to a drop in demand in November", a spokeswoman told AFP.</p>
      <p>"We are continuing to monitor the situation," Freja Annamatz said, adding that SAS plans to resume the regular number of flights during the Christmas and New Year holidays.</p>
      <p>SAS <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20180615/sas-moves-hong-kong-route-from-stockholm-to-copenhagen">moved its Hong Kong route from Stockholm's Arlanda Airport</a> to the Danish capital in 2018, as The Local reported at the time, after struggling with profitability since launching it three years previously.</p>
      <p>Nordic competitor Finnair indicated that it will maintain its two daily flights between Helsinki and the eighth largest international airport in the world.</p>
      <p>"We continue with two daily flights between Helsinki and Hong Kong, and at the moment we have no plans in reducing capacity," a Finnair spokesman told AFP.</p>
      <p>The former British colony is going through its worst political crisis since its return to China in 1997.</p>
      <p>Millions have taken to the streets of Hong Kong, initially against a now-dropped bid by its leaders to allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland.</p>
      <p>But after Beijing and Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam took a hard line, the movement snowballed into a broader push for democracy and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Activists say freedoms are being eroded by Beijing, contrary to a deal that outlines Hong Kong's return to China from British colonial rule.</p>
