      <p>The Samsung Galaxy S10e is <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">currently</a> cheaper than it will be on Black Friday, and by a large margin. The Galaxy S10e is only going to get $200 shaved off of its regular price. But today, over at Daily Steals, you can save a whopping $350 off of the regular price of the Galaxy S10e. You just need to use the promo code AAGLXYSE at checkout.</p>
      <p>Galaxy S10e is Samsung's cheaper Galaxy S10 model. But that doesn't mean it's a bad phone.</p>
      <p>It still has all of the same specs as the more expensive Galaxy S10 models. That includes a Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There's a 5.8-inch full HD+ display on-board. And it is not a curved display. Though it is a hole punch display. But unlike the Galaxy S10+, this does sport a dual front-facing camera, so the hole punch is actually pretty small.</p>

      <p>The bigger deal here is that it's not a curved display and the fingerprint sensor is in the power button. Meaning that it is actually useful and actually works. Considering the under-display sensors aren't that great.</p>
      <p>Now some have complained about battery life. It has a 3100mAh capacity battery, which should still be decent for most people though. Especially considering that this has a full HD+ display instead of a Quad HD+ display, so its pushing less pixels. Not to mention the fact that there is fast charging available â€“ though not quite as fast as the Galaxy Note 10.</p>
      <p>This is a really great phone to pick up. It's worth mentioning that this is a Verizon model, so it will work with Verizon and GSM carriers. Unfortunately, it won't work with Sprint. So if you are a Sprint user, you'll need to look elsewhere.</p>
