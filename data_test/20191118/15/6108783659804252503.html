      <h3>And the Xenophage is getting buffed.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/destiny-2/"><i>Destiny 2</i>‘s</a> Recluse and One-Eyed Mask will be nerfed, developer Bungie has advised, along a buff for the new Xenophage Exotic.</p>
      <p>We’ve the details below</p>
      <h4>Recluse nerfs</h4>
      <p>“Many doubted The Recluse when it was first announced, but it has since proved to be resilient to being squashed,” Bungie said as part of <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48443">its weekly update</a>. “Although the precision damage modifier did not actually improve the efficacy of the weapon at its best, it did allow for fairly mindless spraying to be just as good as concentrated aiming. After considering various options on what to do with it, the decision was made to remove that part of the functionality and preserve its activation methods. The alternative was leaving in an effect we believe to be too strong for a Legendary weapon.”</p>
      <p>As a result, the Recluse has had the precision damage modifier used when used in conjunction with Master of Arms. The weapon will still receive a damage bonus from Master of Arms, though “damage will not default to precision values”.</p>
      <h4>One-Eyed Mask nerfs</h4>
      <p>“In a previous sandbox update, One-Eyed Mask received some tuning in how Vengeance was applied to Titans,” Bungie continued. “Next Season, this perk will continue to provide health regeneration when defeating an opponent that has inflicted damage upon your Guardian, but it will no longer grant an overshield.”</p>
      <p>Simply put, those wearing One-Eyed Mask will no longer be granted an overshield when paired with Vengeance, drastically changing how players will fare in 2-on-1, 3-on-1 or more-on-1 encounters.</p>
      <h4>Xenophage buffs</h4>
      <p>“Xenophage unintentionally shipped a little weak, so it’s getting a bump up in raw damage,” Bungie continued. “Machine Guns have a higher ammunition capacity than other Heavy weapons, trading raw DPS for ease of use. Xenophage slides further towards other Heavy weapons such as Grenade Launchers in that aspect but didn’t get enough power back. This will correct that.”</p>
      <p>As a result, Xenophage’s PvE damage will be increased 50%, while ammo from PvP creates has been increased to 4 (shared crates) or 6 (Heavy ammo crates).</p>
