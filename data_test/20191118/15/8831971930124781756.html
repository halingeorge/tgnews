      <p>Winter holidays are usually not the time when we want to be fit. Yet, with a lot of parties and other social events coming up, who doesn’t want to look especially great? Besides, a good beginning makes a good ending, so it’s nice to get in shape before the end of this year. Here are a few tips on how you can achieve that.</p>
      <h3>Be Active</h3>

      <p>Most of us are usually quite busy during the holiday season. While it can be stressful, there is a benefit to it. Even doing Christmas shopping helps you stay active, so don’t be surprised you’re so tired after a day of running errands. Hosting a party at your place also means you have to clean up beforehand, and this is an excellent method to burn calories too.</p>

      <p>What’s the best way to get in shape in a short period of time? Clean up your diet. Treating yourself is important, but leave that to the holiday dinners. Try avoiding processed foods and go for wholesome meals instead. Also, beware of candy: the number of sweets you’re surrounded by is extra high before Christmas.</p>

      <p>It’s essential to drink plenty of water when the weather is hot, but don’t forget to do it in the winter too. Not only it will lower your appetite and increase metabolism, consuming enough liquids has multiple proven <u><a href="https://collegecandy.com/2019/11/04/7-proven-health-benefits-water-has-on-our-bodies/">health benefits</a></u>. You can also drink unsweetened tea and black coffee, as these count toward your daily fluid intake.</p>

      <p>If you really want to stick to your <u><a href="https://collegecandy.com/2019/10/24/the-perfect-workout-plan-according-to-celebrity-trainers/">workout plan</a></u>, finding the type of training you enjoy is essential. There are a lot of choices, like swimming, boxing, doing Crossfit, dancing and much more. In the winter, options like skiing and ice skating are added.

      <h3>Exercise with a Friend</h3>

      <p>Anything is more fun when you do it with a buddy. Instead of going to the gym alone, bring your friend, or sing up for a new exercise class together. Not only will you keep each other company, but you also can help each other stay motivated, which is the hardest part of working out alone. You can also train with your partner or even your parents.</p>

      <h3>Get a Workout App</h3>

      <p>Workout apps are a fantastic solution for those who like to exercise at home. There are multiple options like Nike Training Club, 8fit and MyFitnessPal (the last one lets you track your meals, too). Such apps provide you with a wide range of workouts, whether short or long, and easy or hard. The notifications will also remind you it’s time to exercise, which is really handy.</p>
