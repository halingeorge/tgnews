      <p>Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Monday said it will start raising rates for services in December to make business viable.</p>
      <p>The telecom sector is highly capital intensive with fast-changing technology cycles that require continuing investments and therefore, extremely important that the industry remains viable to support the vision of Digital India, it said.</p>
      <p>“Accordingly, Airtel will appropriately increase price offerings in the month beginning December,” it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Bharti Airtel, which has been hit hard by the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues, last week posted highest ever loss of ₹ 23,045 crore in the three months ended September.</p>
      <p>The company also said that it understands that telecom regulator TRAI is likely to initiate a consultation for bringing rationality in pricing in the Indian mobile sector, which has been operating at prices that have been eroding its viability.</p>
