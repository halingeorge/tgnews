      <p>Clearly amused, Piers drew attention to his co-star's tears when he asked her if she was crying. "Are you crying?" He said.</p>
      <p>Charlotte shrugged off his prying comments with a smile. She said: "Don't make a fuss."</p>
      <p>Piers tried to antagonise her: "You watched that load of cheese and you are crying?"</p>

      <p>She responded: "I'm sorry, it's just the friendship. Just sometimes these things get me."</p>
      <p>Charlotte may have been left feeling warm and fuzzy inside after watching the GMB advert but she confessed she didn't cry over Excitable Edgar.</p>
      <p>John Lewis set Excitable Edgar in a land far, far, far away as they told the heart-warming Christmas story about little girl Ava and her friend Edgar the dragon.</p>
      <p>In a sad twist of events, the hapless dragon finds himself shunned from the villagers after he accidentally burns down the Christmas tree and decorations.</p>
      <p>But the little redheaded girl hatches an ingenious plan to help her fire-breathing friend spread happiness in time for Xmas.</p>
      <p>Ava gives her dragon pal the job of cooking the Christmas pudding, much to everyone's delight.</p>
