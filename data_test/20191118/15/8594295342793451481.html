      <p>Apologies for another Ford Mustang Mach-E post. Clearly, Dearborn got its wish when it set out to get people talking.</p>
      <p>While the brand’s new Mustang-inspired (and now Mustang-badged) crossover has <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/ford-mustang-mach-e-here-it-is/">generated both acrimony and praise</a>, often split along generational and ideological lines, the story of what could have been is now leaking out. There’s a possibility of another Mustang family member, too, but let’s stick with the Mach-E’s genesis for a bit.</p>
      <p>It would seem, based on conversations with Ford execs, that the vehicle that became the <a href="https://www.macheclub.com/">Mach-E</a> was originally planned as something so mind-numbingly boring, Ford’s incoming CEO smelled a dud. As reported by<i><a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/382783/ford-mustang-mach-e-boring-front-drive-compliance-car/"> Motor1</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ford-could-expand-mustang-line-further-future">Autocar</a></i>, Jim Hackett was the man behind the switch.</p>
      <p>Planning was already well underway two years ago, but Hackett’s arrival at the Glass House put designers back to work crafting something that was more than just a “compliance car.” As the automaker told <i>Motor1</i>, the team was told to play to the brand’s strengths and rid the vehicle of its overpoweringly bland eco-snobbery.</p>
      <p>The Mustang muse stepped into the room, dropped its robe, and the team went to town.</p>
      <p>“This started as another project in around 2014, and about two years ago it switched to this,” Ford of Europe design boss Murat Gueler told <i>Autocar</i>. “The design had a big influence: the whole structure changed, the technology inside changed. We rebooted the whole programme. The designers came up with this concept and everyone went ‘oh, this is good.'”</p>
      <p>If the Mach-E’s design leaves you feeling cold, just imagine what the original plan would have looked like. Actually, you don’t have to ⁠— <i>Motor1</i> shared a sketch showing how the design evolved. That earlier vehicle? Terrible. “Compliance car” is right.</p>
      <p>As for where Ford goes from here, that’s an open question. While Gueler said, “We’ve talked about building a family,” he didn’t specifically confirm any plan to release other EVs under the Mustang name.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to take a Russian doll approach, where you can’t tell them apart other than the size of the car, but we want a family feel where a Ford EV starts to build off this concept,” he said. “But we’d never do a smaller version of this — if we did a smaller vehicle it would have different proportions.”</p>
