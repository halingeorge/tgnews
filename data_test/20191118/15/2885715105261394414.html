      <h1>INX Media case: HC judge clarifies facts of another case mentioned only for reference</h1>
      <h2>The court's clarification came while taking up the matter suo motu (on its own) following news articles that there is 'cut and paste' work in the judgement.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:04:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Delhi High Court clarified on Monday that the facts of another case mentioned in the order denying bail to former finance minister P Chidambaram are only for reference.</p>
      <p>Justice Suresh Kait said it was nowhere mentioned in the November 15 order that the observations made in a particular paragraph are of Chidambaram’s case.</p>
      <p>The court’s clarification came while taking up the matter suo motu (on its own) following news articles that there is ‘cut and paste’ work in the judgement.</p>
      <p>“Thus, there is no cut and paste as alleged and I hereby make it clear that observations made in paragraph 35 shall be read as and are confined to the case of ‘Rohit Tandon Vs Enforcement Directorate’,” the judge said.</p>
      <p>The court directed the chief editors of two newspapers, who have published the “wrong averments”, to clarify the same in their respective newspapers on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It also directed the registry of the high court to send a copy of its Monday order to the chief editors of the two newspapers today itself for necessary compliance.</p>
      <p>The court also clarified that in paragraph 34 of the Chidambaram’s November 15 bail order, “only a reference to the observations made by this court in ‘Rohit Tandon Vs Enforcement Directorate’… has been recorded.”</p>
      <p>In his 41-page verdict on November 15, Justice Kait had cited some paragraphs from 2017 Supreme Court and high court orders rejecting bail to Delhi-based lawyer Rohit Tandon in a money-laundering case.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, ED approached the high court seeking rectification of an “inadvertent” error in the bail order and urged the court to correct the “accidental slip/inadvertent error”.</p>
      <p>Delhi-based lawyer Rohit Tandon, who was arrested in 2016, is an accused in the demonetisation-related money laundering case.</p>
      <p>The senior Congress leader moved the Supreme Court on Monday challenging the Delhi High Court’s Friday order denying him bail in the money laundering case.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/chidambaram-inx-media-scam-case-explained-karti-5921402/">INX Media</a> money-laundering case, the ED had arrested 74-year-old Chidambaram on October 16.</p>
      <p>He was arrested by the CBI on August 21 in the INX Media corruption case and was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the CBI case on October 22.</p>
      <p>The case was registered by the CBI on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007, during Chidambaram’s tenure as finance minister.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, the ED had lodged a money-laundering case in this regard in 2017.</p>
