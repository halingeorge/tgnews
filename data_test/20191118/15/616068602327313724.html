      <p>The reporter who broke the news that Don Cherry had been fired from Sportsnet and "Hockey Night in Canada's Coach's Corner," Joe Warmington of the Toronto Sun, now says Don is making a comeback.</p>
      <p>Warmington says "Don Cherry's Grapevine," is making a comeback, this time as a podcast.</p>
      <p>The 85-year-old known as "Grapes" says he will be doing the podcast with his son Tim and it will be available Tuesday on Spotify and other streaming services.</p>
      <p>Warmington says Cherry plans to address his dismissal along with his views on the NHL and the hockey season.</p>
      <p>The plan is for the segment to start as an audio-only segment but could grow into more as time goes on.</p>
      <p>Don Cherry's Grapevine aired as a television show from 1982 to 1993 and was produced in the Hamilton area.</p>
