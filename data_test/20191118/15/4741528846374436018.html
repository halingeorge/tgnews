      <p>Despite the negative reactions trailing the passage of the <b>Finance Bill</b>, the National Assembly is bent on holding a joint public hearing on the bill tomorrow.</p>
      <p><b>According to <a href="https://punchng.com/finance-bill-nassembly-holds-public-hearing-despite-protests/">Punch</a></b>, many financial experts have expressed their discomfort towards the bill that could see a spike in Value Added Tax, (VAT) Company Income Tax and other taxes.</p>
      <p><b>The Details</b>: However, Solomon Adeola, Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance said the bill is not about increment in VAT but other things like the amendment of seven acts of the National Assembly as well as the removal of taxes for some sectors in the economy.</p>

      <p>“<i>Studying the executive bill that was referred to my committee after passing second reading on the floor of the senate, I realised that there are a lot of ignorance and limited knowledge of the content and import of the Finance Bill.</i></p>
      <p><i>“It is not only meant to increase revenue for the government but to also remove some conflicting and confusing aspects of our laws that had given rise to legal disputations in the past leading to huge loses of revenue for government</i>,” he said.</p>
