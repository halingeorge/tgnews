      <p>If you love Christmas and fancy scoring some extra cash ahead of December, then you’re in luck.</p>
      <p>There’s a new job up for grabs, and it involves stuffing your face full of savoury and sweet treats themed after the festive holiday.</p>
      <p>The Daffodil hotel in Lake District is offering the chance for one person to become to become a taste tester for its luxury festive afternoon tea.</p>
      <p>Not only will you get paid £100 to eat and drink, but you’ll also get a complimentary night’s stay in the hotel for yourself and a plus one, complete with stunning views of the lake.</p>
      <p>As part of the trip, you and your guest will also have access to the hotel’s spa and have the chance to potter about the village of Grasmere.</p>
      <p>There’s only one small catch – you’ll have to pay for the journey to the Lake District yourself.</p>

      <p>But then again, you could consider this a mini holiday and use the money that you’ll make towards the flight, right?</p>
      <p>Once your visit is over, you’ll have to give a detailed account of the afternoon tea to the pastry chef, and the menu sounds pretty delicious.</p>
      <p>Feast on turkey and bacon sliders, brie and cranberry tarts and chicken parfait liver cones, before indulging in serrano and cream cheese mille-feuille and beetroot and goat’s cheese scones.</p>
      <p>As for the sweet side of the dishes, there’s red velvet and peppermint whoopie pies, roasted cashew and mandarin financiers, a chocolate and pistacho Christmas tree, a coconut snowman and more.</p>

      <p>No afternoon tea is complete without a cuppa and some bubbly, both of which are included in your experience.</p>
      <p>So, how can you score this dream gig?</p>
      <p>No need to write a cover letter on how you are a scone master or cake fiend, all you have to do is <a href="https://www.daffodilhotel.co.uk/blog/we-re-recruiting-a-festive-afternoon-tea-taster-applications-are-now-open/">fill in the application</a> on the hotel’s website by 22 November.</p>
      <p>The winner will be picked at random and announced on 25 November.</p>
      <p>If you don’t get the job, you could always take inspiration from the menu and make your very own afternoon tea at home.</p>
