      <p>Today afternoon Hrithik Roshan’s mother Pinkie Roshan treated us with a cute video of the actor, showing off his dancing skills at a very early age, gaining more praise for the actor. Now Megastar Amitabh Bachchan answered one of the Twitter users questions, who shared an old image of the actor, carrying a kid in arms. Further asking the actor who is he holding in his arms? Looking at the picture can you guess, who is this star kid? Hint- She belongs to an illustrious filmy Khandaaan of the tinsel town.</p>
      <p>Well, guys, the little one in Big B’s arms is none other than ethereal beauty of Bollywood, Kareena Kapoor Khan. In the picture, Big B is seen indulging in a conversation with Bebo. The Twitter user tagging Big B asked, “Who are you holding @SrBachchan Ji? I see @earth2angel #karishmakapoor” To which he replied, “bebo ..
