      <h1>Estonian FSA drops Swedbank probe, criminal investigation continues</h1>

      <p>TALLINN — Estonia’s Financial Supervision and Resolution Authority said on Monday it was dropping an investigation into Swedbank’s Estonia unit as the probe was now a criminal proceeding being handled by the country’s prosecutor.</p>
      <p>“The Financial Supervision Authority launched a sanction proceeding on October 28 to investigate the signs of money laundering fraud in Swedbank’s financial supervision proceedings,” the FSA said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“As the inspection revealed signs of a criminal offense, the Financial Supervision Authority decided to abandon sanction proceedings in favor of criminal proceedings.”</p>
      <p>Swedbank did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.</p>
      <p>Late last month, Estonia’s state prosecutor’s office said it had launched a criminal investigation into Swedbank over alleged money laundering between 2011 and 2017.</p>
      <p>The financial regulator said it would cooperate with the prosecutor in the criminal investigation.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a report by Sweden’s public broadcaster SVT alleged that money laundering could have occurred in transactions between Swedbank and Danske Bank in the Baltics between 2007 and 2015.</p>
      <p>Danske is being investigated in five countries over some 200 billion euros ($226 billion) of suspicious payments from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere that were found to have flowed through its Estonian branch.</p>
      <p>Danske and Swedbank have previously admitted to failings in their money laundering controls in the Baltics. (Reporting by Tarmo Virki. Editing by Simon Johnson and Carmel Crimmins)</p>
