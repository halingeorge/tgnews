      <h1>West Brom ready to cash in on Nathan Ferguson if new deal isn't agreed</h1>
      <h2>Albion will consider selling Nathan Ferguson in January if the defender doesn’t put pen-to-paper on a new deal at The Hawthorns.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:57:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>The 19-year-old, whose current contract expires at the end of the season, has enjoyed an impressive breakthrough campaign with the Baggies after initially catching the eye of Slaven Bilic in pre-season training.</p>
      <p>Ferguson has made 13 Championship appearances this season – with the youngster performing well at both right-back and left-back.</p>
      <p>But those displays have led to interest from elsewhere with Tottenham and Crystal Palace reportedly readying bids when the transfer window opens in January.</p>
      <p>As well as that interest from the Premier League, Juventus and Atletico Madrid have also been linked with the defender.</p>
      <p>Albion, though, believe it’s in the best interests of the player to sign the attractive five-year deal on the table. Having been at the club since his was eight and with his family local, they feel The Hawthorns is the best place for his development.</p>
      <p>But should Ferguson move abroad, The Baggies will only be entitled to compensation of around £300,000 under FIFA guidelines.</p>
      <p>With Ferguson set to a command a substantially higher transfer fee should he join an English club in January, Albion will have no option but to consider selling him if he doesn’t commit to a new deal.</p>
      <p>And a bidding war could be sparked if both Tottenham and Crystal Palace sure up their interest.</p>
      <p>Palace are known admirers of the teenager – with Sporting Director Dougie Freedman having regularly been spotted watching Albion’s games.</p>
      <p>The Eagles are also in need of a right-back after selling Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United in the summer for an initial £45million.</p>
      <p>Spurs are also in need of a right-back to compete for a starting spot with Serge Aurier.</p>
      <p>The London club also want to freshen up their squad having won just three of their 12 Premier League matches this season.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Express &amp; Star understands there is no truth in reports that Manchester United are monitoring Albion loanee, Matheus Pereira.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian, who is on loan from Sporting Lisbon, has already agreed terms for a permanent transfer to the Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>And that deal will be completed with the Baggies having the option to sign the player for £8.25million at any point.</p>
