      <p>Mr. Ibrahim Oppong Kwarteng, the Ambassador Extraordinaire of Ghana Prisons presenting the cheque said, the rehabilitation of prisoners was key in reducing re-offending rates.</p>
      <p>“Most often we see prisoners as lost souls, who do not need a second chance in life, but that thinking is wrong because a prison could be anybody’s potential second home. We therefore have a responsibility to show love and care to incarcerated individuals, instead of rejecting the," he said. </p>
      <p>Mr. Kwarteng, who is also the Executive Director of CCF commended Christian Atsu for his immense support and contribution towards the rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-convicts in Ghana and urged other celebrities to emulate him.</p>
      <p>“Christian Atsu has done so much to uplift the image of Ghana Prisons through his various acts of benevolence.</p>
      <p>He has not only contributed financially to the release of over four hundred inmates, but has collaborated with CCF to launch the Ex-convicts Reintegration Project," he added.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador Extraordinaire of Prisons described Christian as a man, who represents the true face of love for humanity. </p>
      <p>Deputy Director of Prisons (DDP), Mark Agbosu, the Officer -in- Charge of Sekondi Central Prison, who received the Cheque thanked the Black Stars midfielder for his continuous support for the Ghana Prisons.</p>
      <p>He appealed to Ghanaians to join in efforts by the Prisons Service to make the prisons a purely correctional institution.</p>
      <p>He urged the public to come to the aid of Sekondi Central Prison by contributing to the various developmental initiatives being undertaken by the prison.</p>
