        <b>A SCOTS hillwalker has been missing overnight on the coldest night of the year after vanishing yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paul Murphy, 51, was last seen leaving his home in Stenhousemuir, Falkirk, at around 7am yesterday, as he set off to go hillwalking.</p>

      <p>He left in his car which has since been found at the Cairngorms Ski Centre in Aviemore.</p>
      <p>He has not been seen or heard from since, and concerns are growing for his safety amid freezing temperatures.</p>
      <p>We told how last night was recorded as the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4966974/scottish-weather-forecast-met-office-cold-freezing/">coldest night of the season so far</a>, with -8.6C recorded in the Highlands.</p>
      <p>Paul is described as 6ft, of stocky build with short black hair and facial hair.</p>
      <p>He was wearing a dark coloured hillwalking jacket, trousers and boots and was carrying a hillwalking rucksack.</p>
      <p>Paul was driving a beige Nissan X trail motor vehicle with registration SM62 BUF which has been traced to the Cairngorms Ski Centre in Aviemore.</p>
      <p>Cops are desperately trying to trace Paul and are appealing to the public for information.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Alyson Bolton of Forth Valley police said: “This is very out of character for Paul who has never gone missing before and his family want to make sure he is ok.</p>
      <p>“We believe he may have travelled to the North East area and urge anyone who may have seen Paul to contact us. Similarly, if Paul is reading this, let us know you are safe and well.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 4053 of Sunday, 17 November, 2019.</p>
      <p>We told earlier how a Scots mum has frantically pleaded with her teenage daughter to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4967600/kilmarnock-missing-mum-plea-return/">come home after she vanished two days ago.</a></p>
      <p>Shekira Horner, 17, was last seen heading towards Kilmarnock train station at around 5.30pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Since then, her phone has been switched off and friends and family have not seen or heard from her.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4967527/calum-mackenzie-missing-body-found-alness-river-averon/">body has been pulled from a river</a> in the Highlands during a search for a missing man.</p>
      <p>Calum MacKenzie disappeared from his home in Salvesen Crescent in Alness, Ross and Cromarty, on Thursday November 7.</p>
