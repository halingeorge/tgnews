        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> doesn’t regret making a dig at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/zayn-malik/">Zayn Malik</a> during his Saturday Night Live opening monologue.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Watermelon Sugar singer hosted (and sang) on the NBC sketch show for the first time and immediately joked about Zayn when talking about his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> pals.</p>
      <p>A source told Hollywood Life: ‘Harry knew what he was getting into when he was joking about Zayn.</p>
      <p>‘There has been issues with Zayn with all of the guys for a long time and this joke was simply innocent fun tinged with some reality.</p>
      <p>‘Zayn has always been difficult, so to do that joke was on purpose and Harry doesn’t regret it.’</p>
      <p>During his opening monologue, the 25-year-old joked: ‘I love those guys. They’re my brothers. Niall, Liam, Louis… and, uh, Ringo. Yeah, that’s it.’</p>
      <p>Considering Zayn hasn’t kept in contact with his former band mates since being the first to leave four years ago, the joke was a relief to hear.</p>

      <p>Harry referenced legendary Beatles drummer Ringo Starr as he was also the first member of the group to leave back in 1968.</p>

      <p>‘As much as fans of One Direction might be mad, Harry is not worrying about it and doesn’t expect the joke to come back and haunt him,’ the source revealed. ‘The guys in the band are all in different parts of their life right now, they aren’t getting back together anytime soon or at all.</p>
      <p>‘So Harry wanted to do the joke and he will move on with it, if there is a response from Zayn so be it but he is not stressing on it too much.’</p>
      <p>Zayn did call One Direction ‘generic as f***’ at one point, so we wouldn’t stress too much either.</p>
      <p>Harry put every Directioner back in their feels as he starred in most of the sketches, sporting numerous wigs and wonderful blue and pink painted nails.</p>

      <p>Only Harry can get away with releasing a summer song during from his forthcoming album Fine Line</p>

      <p>Watermelon Sugar sees Harry lusting after a former love with lyrics including: ‘Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin’, and it sounds just like a song / I want more berries and that summer feelin’, It’s so wonderful and warm.’</p>
