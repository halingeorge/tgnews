      <p>An off-duty police officer who killed a one-year-old girl when he crashed his sports car into her family’s SUV at 94mph will not be charged, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Christopher Manuel, a police officer in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, will not even be charged with speeding in connection with the crash that sent one-year-old Seyaira Stephen flying from her family’s vehicle in October 12, authorities said this week.</p>
      <p>Police originally arrested the girl’s mother, 21-year-old Brittany Stephens on suspicion of negligent homicide, claiming he child would not have been ejected from the car if she had been properly secured in her car seat. That charge was later dropped.</p>
      <p>East Baton Rouge district attorney Hillar Moore said the decision not to charge Manuel came after prosecutors felt they could not meet the burden of proof for homicide or negligent injury.</p>

      <p>Moore told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/15/baby-died-after-cop-drove-mph-crashed-his-corvette-officer-wont-face-charges/">The Washington Post</a>: ‘You never want any officer traveling 94 miles an hour. It’s just stupid. It’s dangerous.’</p>

      <p>‘But when we looked at the law and the facts and the circumstances, we just thought that this was the only reasonable decision to make,’ Moore continued.</p>
      <p>He added that prosecutors were reluctant to charge the girl’s mother after she already ‘punished herself.’</p>
      <p>Marcus Allen, an attorney for Brittany Stephens, hit out at the prosecutor for failing to bring charges against Manuel.</p>
      <p>Allen said: ‘(Manuel) turned a highway into a raceway. Brittany will never see that child again. And now at the end of the day he literally walks away with nothing.</p>
      <p>He said his client texted him to say she was furious and hurt after learning Manuel would not be charged.</p>

      <p>‘I told her, “You’re justified,”‘ he said.</p>
      <p>Manuel remains on the police force and the department is conduction an internal investigation into the crash.</p>
      <p>The crash that killed Seyaira also left many of her family members severely injured. Stephen’s mother, Janice Johnson, was in the SUV. She suffered a crushed lung and broken bones in the crash and struggled with basic self-care for three months after the collision.</p>
      <p>Three children were also reportedly injured, including a 15-year-old who now uses a wheelchair and is unable to return to school because of a brain injury.</p>
