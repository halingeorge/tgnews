      <h2>Greene King pubs will be handing out free Coca-Cola to designated drivers over the Christmas period - check to see if your local drinking establishment is on the list</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T15:29:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>As much as we love Christmas, all that eating, drinking and socialising really takes it out of us.</p>
      <p>So if you're looking to calm down on the alcohol this year and trying going to the pub sober at least once this season, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coca-cola">Coca-Cola</a> have decided to make things a little easier.</p>
      <p>For the festive season of goodwill, the soft drinks company has decided to hand out free Coca-Cola to designated drivers this Christmas, for the tenth year in a row.</p>
      <p>Throughout the festive season, anyone that shows their keys and agrees to stay off the sauce in any <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/greene-king">Greene King</a> pub can receive a voucher when they buy a soft drink to get their second one free, whether you're after a Coke, a Diet Coke or a non-alcoholic Heineken.</p>

      <p>Available at every Greene King pub (that's over 1,000 of them) - including Hungry Horse, Chef &amp; Brewer, and Farmhouse Inns - from now until 1 January 2020, according to Lad Bible, Coca-Cola and Greene King hope that the initiative will help promote responsible drinking.</p>
      <p>Paul Robertson, Associate Director, On-Premise at Coca-Cola European Partners GB, explained: "We'd like to thank Greene King for partnering with us for the last 10 years on the Designated Driver campaign and continuing to evolve the platform to ensure it remains relevant to today's consumers.</p>

      <p>"Greene King should be applauded for its continued leadership in helping to promote responsible drinking and embracing the role soft drinks can play across its estate, especially on the lead up to Christmas. Here's to another 10 years of partnership."</p>
      <p>Phil Thomas, Chief Commercial Officer at Greene King, added: "As a leading pub company, we have an important role to play in helping to promote responsible drinking and we have given away around a quarter of a million free Coca-Cola products over the past decade as part of the Designated Driver campaign."</p>
      <p>To get your free soft drink, simply show your car keys at the bar and buy a Heineken 0.0, any 330ml bottle of Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Diet Coke or a 275ml Appletiser, and you'll be given a voucher to get your next one for free.</p>
