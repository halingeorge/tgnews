      <p>Roman Kemp, 26, was forced to tackle the plank challenge in strong winds last night, in an attempt to gain entry to the more comfortable camp in the jungle.</p>
      <p>And his famous parents <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/martin-kemp-marks-end-of-owen-family-in-eastenders-with-emotional-message/">Martin</a> and Shirlie Kemp were watching from home, possibly even more terrified than their son!</p>
      <p>Capital DJ star Roman and Myles Stephenson, 28, had to climb DOWN a ladder suspended 334 feet in the air off the 32-storey Focus Building on Australia's Gold Coast.</p>

      <p>Hosts Ant and Dec explained that each celeb would walk along a plank and climb down its ladder to reach the 'yellow zone'.</p>
      <p>There, they had to hit a button when a light turned green, before making their way back.</p>
      <aside>Phew I can breath! Shirlie is shaking!</aside>
      <p>The duo with the fastest combined response time become one of two 'Power Pairs', earning the right to live in the more comfortable Croc Creek camp.</p>

      <p>As if the challenge wasn't terrifying enough, the stars also had to contend with unusually high winds.</p>
      <p>"Thankfully we've had a word with health and safety and we're still fine to do it," confirmed Ant.</p>
      <p>While Ian Wright and Jacqueline Jossa came in at 3.40 seconds, Andrew Maxwell and Kate Garraway were just ahead on 3.39 seconds.</p>
      <p>But Myles and Roman were the clear winners, with a combined time of 1.45 seconds - making them a Power Pair.</p>
      <p>Watching from home, dad Martin admitted he'd been "breathless" while mum Shirlie was "shaking".</p>

      <p>He tweeted: "Well done on the ladder... Phew I can breath! Shirlie is shaking!"</p>
      <p>Shirlie also tweeted, admitting she was "so nervous" to watch her son take part in the ITV show.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actor and Spandau Ballet star Martin, 58, and his singer/dancer wife Shirlie, 57 - who were introduced by the late George Michael - also have a daughter Harley Moon.</p>
      <p>Talking about his famous dad - who he appeared with on Celebrity <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/">Gogglebox</a> - Roman joked: "I am not scared of the eating trials because I grew up with Dad's cooking!</p>
      <p>"I think the eating ones I will hate but I will do them. The show is iconic and you want to do everything."</p>

      <p>Asked what his parents thought of him doing the show, Roman said: "My Dad loves it. He is ready to find the worst freeze frame possible of my face and put it out on social media!</p>
      <p>"Mum will say she hates it up until the day I get in there. Once she sees the show, understands it and grasps I am in there, I think she will be alright. She is really nervous though!"</p>
      <p>TV fans know that Martin is no stranger to hardships himself, after taking part in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/reality-tv/love-island-star-horrifies-fans-with-scary-weight-loss/">Bear Grylls' Celebrity Island</a>, in which he lost two stone.</p>
