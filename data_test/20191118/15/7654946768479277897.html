      <h1>Muncie mayor Dennis Tyler arrested by FBI in corruption probe</h1>

      <p>The mayor of the Indiana city of Muncie, Dennis Tyler, was arrested by the FBI at his home Monday amid a years-long corruption probe.</p>
      <p>An FBI spokeswoman <a href="https://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/crime/2019/11/18/muncie-mayor-dennis-tyler-arrested-by-fbi-agents/4227206002/">confirmed to the Muncie Star Press</a> that the arrest warrant was executed at the 76-year-old Democratic mayor’s northside home.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm an arrest warrant was executed at the home of Mayor Dennis Tyler this morning and he is currently in custody,” spokeswoman Christine Bavener said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear what charges Tyler, who has held the office of mayor since 2012, was facing.</p>
      <p>According to the Muncie Star Press, a federal investigation into allegations of corruption linked to the Tyler administration has been underway for nearly four years.</p>
      <p>The probe, according to the news outlet, started in early 2016 with Craig Nichols, Tyler’s former building commissioner.</p>
      <p>Nichols pleaded guilty last January to wire fraud and money laundering and was sentenced to two years in federal prison, according to the report.</p>

      <p>Others charged in the probe include Nikki Grigsby, the Muncie Sanitary District administrator, Tracy Barton, another official with the Muncie Sanitary District and local businessmen Jeffrey Burke, Tony Franklin and Rodney Barber, the Muncie Star Press reported.</p>
      <p>Tyler’s term in office is slated to end on Dec. 31. Last year, he announced he would not seek a third term as mayor.</p>
      <p>News of Tyler’s arrest comes after Ron Meer, the mayor of Michigan City, Indiana, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/indiana-mayor-facing-multiple-felonies-after-police-force-shake-up/">was hit with multiple felony charges</a> following a dispute with his local police department.</p>
