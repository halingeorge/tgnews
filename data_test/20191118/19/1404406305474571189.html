      <p>DeHaven opened up to VladTV about Dame Dash and Kareem "Biggs" Burke linking up with Jay-Z. DeHaven explained that he wasn't eager to join the building of Roc-A-Fella in the beginning because he thought Jay-Z would reach back to him if it became a success.</p>
      <p>DeHaven went on to speak about catching a kingpin charge in the late 90s and being picked up from a North Carolina court building while paying a traffic ticket. He also spoke about Emory Jones being indicted in the case and DeHaven addressed facing life in prison for the charges, which you can hear more about above.</p>
