      <h1>Third Maoist suspect identified</h1>
      <h2>Alan and Thaha remanded in police custody from Friday</h2>

      <p>A special team of the Kozhikode City police has claimed that it had identified the third suspect in the Maoist link case.</p>
      <p>A senior officer said C.P. Usman, 40, hailing from Pandikkad, Malappuram district and who has been involved in several cases in north Kerala, was charged with at least four cases under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in Wayanad, Malappuram and Thrissur districts.</p>
      <p>He was arrested on similar charges of having association with the CPI(Maoist) and reportedly indulging in carrying out the propaganda of the banned outfit in 2016. One of the cases was registered at the Karuvarakundu police station, Malappuram.</p>
      <p>The police have been trying to find the third suspected Maoist in the case after they had taken two CPI(M) workers, Alan Suhaib and Thaha Fasal, into custody on November 1.</p>
      <p>Both were booked under the UAPA for alleged Maoist links.</p>
      <h3>On the run</h3>
      <p>Usman who was with the duo has been on the run since then. However, investigators had not been able to trace his identity even after they secured Alan and Thaha in custody for interrogation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Alan and Thaha were produced before the Kozhikode Sessions Court on Monday and remanded in police custody from Friday. Sessions Judge M.R. Anitha remanded both of them in judicial custody.</p>
      <p>Also, public prosecutor and government pleader K.N. Jayakumar in the case did not press for their further custodial interrogation.</p>
