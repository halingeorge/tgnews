      <h1>Vice chancellor says universities can afford to pay more in pensions row ahead of eight day strike </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:42:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/camilla-turner/" target="_blank">Camilla Turner</a></address>
      <p>A vice-Chancellor has broken ranks to argue that universities can afford to pay more in a pension row ahead of an eight day strike.</p>
      <p>Prof Anthony Forster of Essex University, said that trustees of the pension scheme were “being overly prudent in their assumptions, which undervalue assets and overestimate liabilities”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/31/million-students-face-disruption-academics-56-universities-sign/">Over a million students face disruption</a> as academics from 57 universities signed up to strike over their pay and pension.</p>
      <p>Members of the University and College Union (UCU) voted to back strike action in two ballots over pensions and pay and working conditions. Lecturers and other university staff will begin an eight day walk out on Monday.</p>
      <p>UCU has been locked in a battle with Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-Chancellors, over proposed pension reforms to address a reported deficit and rising benefit costs.</p>

      <p>Last spring, lectures and classes were disrupted at more than 60 universities by 14 days of strikes across four weeks.</p>
      <p>At the time, the row centred on proposals that would change the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) from a "defined benefit" scheme, which gives workers a guaranteed income in their retirement, to a purely "defined contribution" scheme, in which pensions are subject to fluctuations in the stock market.  </p>
      <p>The current dispute is over UCU members being forced to make increased contributions to maintain the same level of benefits. Employees are now paying in 9.6 per cent of their salary to the scheme rather than the 8 per cent they paid last year.</p>
      <p>In a blog post published by Essex University, Prof Forster criticised negotiators for “not willing to embrace principled compromise in seeking a solution” to the crisis.</p>
      <p>He added: “The inability of those who decide our pension arrangements to ensure we have a fair and sustainable scheme is a source of regret and dismay”.</p>
      <p>Prof Forster used the blog to warn that “continued failure” to reach a deal on the future of the USS will affect the sustainability of  universities as well as their ability to recruit top academics from around the world.</p>
      <p>Essex “remain[s] willing to increase employer contributions to the scheme, to sustain critical features of the USS, including defined benefits,” he added.</p>
      <p>UUK has previously said industrial action would be damaging for both staff and students and that employers “remain open to further talks” with UCU to discuss how the dispute can be resolved without industrial action.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for USS employers said: "Employers have increased contributions from 18% to 21.1% to protect members’ pensions benefits at current levels.</p>
      <p>"Our position has been formed following extensive engagement and consultation with the 340 employers in USS. </p>
      <p>"The vast majority of employers believe the current arrangement where employers meet 65% of costs and members 35% is fair and reasonable.</p>
      <p>"A higher cost national settlement is not affordable for most employers. If any employer takes a different view then they can choose to make an additional payment at a local level to offset higher pensions contributions for their staff."</p>
