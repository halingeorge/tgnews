      <h1>Dreaming of traveling to Australia? Qantas offers $100 flights — but you have to book fast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:55:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/travel/" target="_blank">Julia Thompson, USA TODAY</a></address>
      <p>Australia-based airline Qantas is celebrating its 100th year with a sale: $100 flights to the land down under from four major U.S. airports. </p>
      <p>The one-way economy fares cost $100 each way (the price includes taxes and fees) and must be purchased as part of a round-trip itinerary from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas/Fort Worth or Chicago. So if travelers play their cards right and snag one of the limited sale seats, they could get a $200 round-trip ticket. </p>
      <p>But only 100 seats will be released each day.</p>
      <p>The phased sale will last four days, with one U.S. city featured each day at <a href="https://www.qantas.com/us/en/promotions/birthday-sale.html">qantas.com/birthdaysale</a></p>
      <p>Qantas was unable to release which cities would be featured on which days beyond Monday. Seats from Los Angeles International Airport to Sydney and Melbourne (50 seats each) will go on sale around 5 p.m. EST Monday. Outbound travel dates are limited to Feb. 23 and 24; March 1, 2 and 8. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The other sale cities will be announced and on the Qantas website and social media around 5 p.m. EST Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, but travelers will have to keep a close eye on the site for the city order:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>San Francisco International Airport to Brisbane, a new route taking off in February, will be featured in the sale along with flights from San Francisco to Melbourne. Each route will get 50 sale seats each. </li>
        <li>Chicago O'Hare International Airport to Brisbane, a route launching in April, will feature 100 sale seats. </li>
        <li>Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport to Sydney will have 100 seats available in the sale. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to the 100-seat limit per day, travelers should note the sale fares are only available on certain days and flights. The minimum stay in Australia is seven days, and the maximum stay is 12 months. </p>
      <p>For those who miss out on the birthday sale, Qantas is offering reduced fares to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, starting at $699 round trip. </p>
      <p>Qantas also flies from Honolulu, which is not featured in the sale. The airline officially turned 99 and kicked off its 100th year, on Nov. 16.</p>
