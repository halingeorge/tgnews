      <h1>Ileana D'Cruz: I cherish what I had with Andrew and look back at it with a smile</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Rachana-Dubey-479235573.cms" target="_blank">TNN</a></address>
      <p>It has been over a year since she appeared on any public platform. Except for being papped outside her gym occasionally, Ileana D’Cruz has maintained a low profile. While rumours of her break-up (with Australian photographer Andrew Kneebone) has been hitting the headlines over the past couple of months, the actress says that she deliberately stayed away from the spotlight, as she needed to work on herself. Now, however, she is back where she is the happiest — in front of the camera. Ahead of her next release, director Anees Bazmi’s 'Pagalpanti', Ileana speaks to BT about moving on from her relationship of many years, bringing life back on track and making wise career choices. Excerpts...</p>

      <p><b>After 'Raid' (2018), you vanished from the scene, only to reappear as the finale show-stopper at BTFW 2019, which took place last month. What was that phase of absence like?<br/></b>It felt great to walk the ramp. I am always nervous before a walk; I wonder how the models do it. But something about that night was so right. And, when you are feeling great overall, it just shows. Lately, I have been having trouble accepting the way I look. Over the last year or so, I was on medication; there were even days when I had 12 pills in one go. I went off the radar after 'Raid' because I had to undergo tests every few weeks. The tablets made me put on weight, which I worked hard to knock off. The paparazzi photographs can be unflattering; there were times when I wanted to hit the gym, but would get papped outside and the pictures were quite bad. Now, of course, I have lost a lot of weight because I am off medication, am looking after myself a lot more and am feeling nice. But, in my head, I am still that fat girl (laughs!).</p>

Did being around familiar faces and working on a light and breezy film like this help? <br/></b>Yes, it helped a lot. 'Pagalpanti' is a crazy film. John (Abraham) plays a guy with bad luck and my character gets into trouble</p>
      <p>because she is in love with him. It was an amazing bunch of actors to hang out with. I made friends with Arshad (Warsi), who has a great vibe. It was also a lot of fun working with John.</p>
      <p><b>Talking about movies, in the last few years, the focus of cinema has shifted from stardom to acting prowess. As an actress who has straddled both kinds of cinema — massy entertainers and content-driven ones — are you happy with the way things function now? <br/></b>At the end of the day, if the audience doesn’t enjoy your experiments with cinema, it’s not going to help. The good part is that the audience is open to the variety in content, now. Gritty films like 'Badla' can co-exist with massy ones and they’re all doing well. Even off-beat subjects are doing decent business. So, it’s a plus if you can act. I’ve worked in about 30 films in 13-14 years, which I feel is a good number. Initially, I was like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>, doing four films a year. Then, I felt that maybe, I need to slow down. Today, I don’t feel like I have missed out on anything. Sometimes, things have not worked out for some unusual reasons, but I have no regrets. I’m sure something better is around the corner.</p>
      <p><b>At the moment, apart from 'Pagalpanti', there’s only 'The Big Bull' in your kitty. Do you feel that being so selective is a good idea, especially when there’s a burst of new ideas, new faces and filmmakers with fresh concepts?<br/></b>I was always conscious about what I chose and I still am. After '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Barfi">Barfi!</a>' (2012), I received many offers to play a Bengali girl, but why would I do it again? With me, it’s always about instinct, even if something sounds great on paper. I am fine with being more selective about what I do. Yes, there are a lot of newcomers, but I don’t feel the need to rush. At the end of the day, a film is for posterity. You have to be sure about it because it can’t be erased. So, instead of rushing in and choosing 20 films, I’d rather do fewer films and stay relevant. Besides, why bombard the audience with too much of you? A little mystery is always good.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Clearly, in your 15-year-career, you’ve not followed industry norms. Did that make things tough?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m a wild child, a rebel who has never stuck to norms. I’ve made my own rules and lived by them, but of course, it comes at a price. Once, during the initial days of my career, I asked a choreographer why people thought I am snooty and difficult — is it because I don’t agree with everyone all the time or because I speak my mind? She told me, ‘Just be yourself and everyone will get used to it’. That has stayed with me. It’s easy to get caught up with things and lose yourself. Losing sanity is a far bigger price than losing a career. Though I am myself, I don’t think I am hated for it. I do everything keeping in mind that at the end of the day, I need to sleep with my conscience clear.</p>
      <p>
        <b>On the personal front, speculations about your break-up with Andrew Kneebone surfaced when you unfollowed each other on social media, followed by a couple of cryptic messages on your Instagram account...</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have always kept my personal life away from the spotlight, as it’s not fair to the other person. Now, I can just say that I loved the experiences I had. Every bit of every year that we spent together has made me grow as a person. Today, I am in a better space, working on myself, which I didn’t give as much importance previously, and that was my own fault. It’s about time I took care of myself. There’s no point kicking up dirt when it’s not needed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>While you have every right to remain silent about your personal life, it can also give rise to more rumours and speculations...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, people talk, irrespective of what you do. At the end of the day, I am not answerable to anyone beyond my family. Life goes on. Today, I am talked about, it will be someone or something else tomorrow. All I can say is, some of my posts were lines from some poems, and I shared them because they were actually conveying what I was feeling. You will lose family along the way and the very thought terrifies me, but it’s inevitable. The only person who will be with you in all of this is you. Every time I went in for therapy, I was told that I have to make the effort to heal myself. That’s stuck with me. When you are with someone else, you’re busy looking after them and managing your career, and in the process, your well-being takes a backseat. You know what? It’s not so bad to be a little selfish sometimes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are you trying to say that your relationship took up a lot of your space?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Relationships do take a lot of your time, and you make them a priority, but it should not be a burden. Trying too hard to make it work is not a great sign. Also, you should not forget yourself in a relationship. It’s not anyone else’s fault, but yours if that happens. It’s not others’ responsibility to make you happy, but, unfortunately, that happens in many relationships.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What went wrong with your relationship? Did distance and the fact that you have different professions cause the rift?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not all all. I could probably be with an actor and it would seem monotonous talking about the same things at work and at home. It’s great for a couple to follow different professions. Also, people say that long-distance relationships are hard to maintain, but distance never really matters. You can be miles apart and still be together, while sometimes, under the same roof, you could be miles apart. It’s not the best time to talk about what really went wrong. Right now, I just cherish what I had with Andrew and I look back with great memories and a smile. I’m at peace with myself.</p>
      <p>
        <b>While talking about her relationship with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arjun-Kapoor">Arjun Kapoor</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Malaika">Malaika</a> Arora had told BT that second chances are difficult to come by, and when that happens, you should grab it with both your hands. Would you give another relationship a chance in your life?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m not looking to be in a relationship right now. It doesn’t matter if you look like chalk and cheese to others, what’s important is how you two feel together. There’s a reason Malaika and I get along so well. We think alike. Malla and Arjun were in a public space where they were okay to speak about their relationship, while respecting each other’s privacy. I like that about them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are you still friends with Andrew?</b>
      </p>
      <p>(Long pause) I can’t really answer this right now.</p>
