      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m a Celebrity 2019</a> has kicked off and it’s as compulsive as ever.</p>
      <p>For many viewers at home, it’s as much a sign of it being Christmas as the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/john-lewis-apologise-christmas-traumatises-devastated-children-excitable-edgar-melting-olaf-frozen-11126666/">John Lewis advert</a> or the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/will-coca-cola-christmas-11068259/">Coca-Cola truck</a>.</p>
      <p>But as we settle down for wintry nights watching celebrities including <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/02/old-caitlyn-jenner-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins-kardashians-star-tipped-im-celebrity-11029458/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> ‘enjoying’ the warmer weather down under, where exactly is the camp?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know about that I’m A Celebrity location.</p>
      <h3>Where is I’m a Celeb filmed?</h3>
      <p>The show is filmed in Murwillumbah, New South Wales.</p>
      <p>More specifically it’s filmed inside the Springbrook National Park.</p>

      <p>The show has been filmed here since its second series back in 2003 – having previously been filmed in Cairns, Queensland.</p>
      <p>So while some things will be different this year – like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebrity-bosses-confirm-live-bugs-wont-be-eaten-in-bush-tucker-trials-11168266/">no more live critters used for Bush Tucker trials</a> – it’ll still look like the camp we’ve come to know and love for such <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/16/the-10-funniest-ever-im-a-celebrity-moments-7081424/">iconic moments</a> as Peter Andre and Katie Price falling in love before our eyes and Gillian McKeith being, well, Gillian McKeith.</p>

      <p>Viewers might just get to see the camp, the bridges and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-and-dec/">Ant and Dec</a>’s studio, but there’s a whole headquarters going on.</p>
      <p>There’s an on-site medical facility, a space for props storage and an area where family and friends of the celebrities gather on the morning of each eviction.</p>
      <h3>Where do I’m a Celebrity contestants stay after leaving the jungle?</h3>

      <p>When a campmate is voted off the show, they’ll recover at the five-star Versace Hotel in Surfers Paradise – almost worth eating a stray testicle for.</p>
