      <h1>Report: Everton and Newcastle interested in Mohammed Salisu</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:15:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>Everton and Newcastle United have been credited with an interest in Real Valladolid defender Mohammed Salisu.</p>
      <p><a href="https://pucelafichajes.com/2019/11/everton-schalke04-sevilla-y-newcastle-interesados-en-salisu/">Pucela Fichajes</a>, who cover Valladolid, claim the Premier League outfits are two of a few teams casting their eye over the promising central defender.</p>
      <p>Bundesliga side Schalke 04 and La Liga club Sevilla are also monitoring him according to the report.</p>

      <p>Salisu supposedly has a buyout clause of €12 million/£10 million, making him a relatively cost-effective option for potential suitors.</p>
      <p>Ghanaian defender Salisu has made 13 appearances so far this season for Valladolid in La Liga and has scored one goal.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old has made a big impression at the back and has helped his team into a comfortable position in the table of 13th after 13 games – eight points clear of the relegation zone.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Everton surely in greater need</h3>
      <p>Everton are surely in need of new centre-back more than Newcastle.</p>

      <p>At the moment Marco Silva has just three options available to him in Yerry Mina, Michael Keane and Mason Holgate, with the former somewhat fragile.</p>
      <p>The club failed to land Kurt Zouma in the summer and seemingly did not have an alternative option – perhaps Salisu could be worth a punt and he would fit Marcel Brands’ transfer policy.</p>
      <p>Newcastle have actually been fairly solid defensively under Steve Bruce and have an array of good options at the back such as Fabian Schar, Florian Lejeune, Federico Fernandez, Paul Dummett and Jamaal Lascelles, who will return from injury in early 2020.</p>
