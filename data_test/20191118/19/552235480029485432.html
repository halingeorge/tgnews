      <p>Celtic defender <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christopher-jullien">Christopher Jullien</a> has been opened-up on his 10-in-a-row ambition and life in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The big stopper revealed that he's not a huge fan of the weather but praised the quality of his teammates and the kindness of Celtic fans.</p>
      <p>The £7m defender has been a huge hit since <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> brought brought in the Frenchman from Toulouse, forming a formidable partnership with Kris Ajer.</p>
      <p>Jullien has been blown away by how he's been welcomed in his adopted homeland since he arrived in the summer and hopes to pay back this debt of kindness by leading the Hoops to the Europa League final in Gdansk.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://twitter.com/beinsports_FR">beIN Spor</a> t: "Since my signing, the staff, the club and the fans have been brilliant with me. They welcomed me with open arms and now I feel good on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"I play with terrific players, all players have almost international level. They have major qualities.</p>
      <p>"I defend well and I pass the ball to my midfielders. There is no VAR in Scotland, so it’s more physical, rougher but I like it.</p>
      <p>"If I had a magic wand, I would love to reach the Europa League Final and score 10 goals this season!</p>
      <p>"We want to equal the 9-in-a-row record this season and the huge goal next season is to win 10-in-a-row.</p>
      <p>"You have to visit Celtic Park to believe it. Football fans know <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-park">Celtic Park</a> is incredible but in there the atmosphere is unbelievable.</p>
      <p>"Celtic fans are nice, they stop me in the city to take selfies.</p>
      <p>Jullien may be positive about life in Scotland but admits one aspect of the move has been a culture shock.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow climate can be tough for people who move from the East of the country, never mind the south of France.</p>
      <p>"At this time it’s minus five or six in Scotland and it gets dark at 4:30pm in Glasgow. It’s the only negative point.</p>
