      <h4>‘DWTS’ is just one episode away from the season 28 finale. The ‘DWTS’ semi-finals will be jam-packed from start to finish and will feature two performances from each couple.</h4>
      <p>There’s only one week left until <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/dancing-with-the-stars"><i>Dancing With the Stars</i></a> will crown a new champion. The celebrities left include<b> James Van Der Beek</b>, <b>Hannah Brown</b>, <b>Kel Mitchell</b>, <b>Ally Brooke</b>, and <b>Lauren Alaina</b>. The semi-finals air Nov. 18 and the five remaining celebrity and pro-dancer couples will compete in two rounds. In the first round, the celebrities will repeat a style of dance they struggled with earlier in the season with a new song. The judges will mentor all of the couples.</p>
      <p>In the second round, the couples will perform a style of dance they haven’t performed before.

Kel and Witney will also be dancing a contemporary but will perform a tango as their second dance. James and Emma will dance the cha-cha and foxtrot during the semi-finals.</p>

      <p>At the end of the night, the live vote will be combined with the judges’ scores and tabulated in real-time, with the bottom two revealed during the broadcast.
