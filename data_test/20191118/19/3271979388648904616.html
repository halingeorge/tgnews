      <p><b>Bindi Irwin</b> and her fiancé <b>Chander Powell</b> have not been fighting nonstop since getting engaged in July. A new tabloid report claiming otherwise is false. <b>Gossip Cop</b> has investigated the story and can debunk it.</p>
      <p>The idea of Irwin and Powell’s relationship being in trouble has been a common one in the tabloids recently. The latest example comes from <b><i>Woman’s Day</i></b>. The phony article is based around a questionable eyewitness who claimed to have seen Irwin and Powell “having a terse conversation” in a parking lot where “Bindi looked anxious…like she didn’t want to be there. As for Chandler, he was fuming.” This supposed argument was just the latest example, according to the tabloid, of the couple “fighting like cats and dogs.”</p>
      <p>The outlet goes on to contend the couple’s relationship is in trouble as a result of the pressures that come with a wedding. Following another debunked tabloid narrative about Irwin family drama causing the wedding stress, so-called “friends” of the couple are quoted as saying, “Bindi is feeling the full weight of the mending the family feud, as well as the stress of trying to blend her family with Chandler’s and make sure everyone’s happy.”</p>
      <p>There’s no evidence that Irwin and Powell’s relationship in trouble. If anything, all the evidence points to the opposite being the case. Powell’s birthday was last week and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B40mw_LBuKc/">Irwin posted a photo of the couple on her Instagram account</a> with the caption, “Happy Birthday to the love of my life. Reflecting on the last six years spent together filled with epic adventures, wonderful laughter &amp; incredible friendship. Chandler, thank you for being you. I love you with all my heart. I can’t wait to call you my husband.” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B41wuYYBnKn/">Powell also posted a photo of the couple together</a> on his birthday at a picnic his fiancée planned for him. The next day, Powell <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B44ohSgBEKg/">posted yet another photo of the couple together</a> at Steve Irwin Day at the Australia Zoo.</p>
      <p>While few details of the couple’s wedding have emerged publicly, Bindi’s younger brother Robert said over the weekend that <a href="https://people.com/tv/robert-irwin-stoked-to-walk-bindi-down-the-aisle-at-her-wedding/">he would be walking his sister down the aisle</a>, telling <i>People</i>, “I was so excited and really honored for her to ask me to walk her down the aisle.” Robert also told the publication he was looking forward to the wedding and that Bindi has been involving the entire family in the planning, in direct contrast to what the tabloids have been falsely reporting.</p>
      <p>This same premise was thoroughly busted by <b>Gossip Cop</b> two weeks ago when <i>Woman’s Day</i> claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/bindi-irwin-chandler-powell-wedding-off/">Irwin was calling off her wedding to Powell</a>. That article, like this one, blamed family pressure – but again, there’s no evidence that any family drama is causing a rift in Irwin and Powell’s relationship. There’s lots of proof indicating their relationship is going strong.</p>
