      <p><b>SEVIER COUNTY, Tenn. (WVLT) --</b> You may have noticed there are no recycling bins at Dollywood. So how is waste in Sevier County composted and recycled? A Dollywood spokesperson gave some behind-the-scenes details.</p>
      <p>Wes Ramsey, a Dollywood employee, said nearly 70 percent of their waste is composted and recycled, and Sevier County is one of the first to use large rotating drums to break down trash to compost.</p>

      <p><a href="https://blog.dollywood.com/index.php/2018/04/20/why-you-dont-see-recycling-bins-at-dollywood/">According to Ramsey</a>, the rotating digesters are able to send nearly 70 percent of incoming waste to composting and recycling which minimizes the amount of trash that ends up in landfills.</p>
      <p>Ramsey said the facility accepts waste from Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, Gatlinburg, Sevier County and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Ramsey added.</p>
      <p>He added that all of the trash collected is mixed with bio-solids and put into the digesters for three days. During this time items like food and paper become compost.</p>
      <p>The compost is then moved through sifters where items like plastic and glass are removed and recycled, Ramsey said.</p>
      <p>After the sifting process, the compost is placed in windrows where it breaks down further. Weeks later, the compost is sifted once again before Grade A compost is produced.</p>
      <p>Ramsey said Sevier County residents can get free bags of the compost for their own use at home. Local farmers can also use the compost for their fields.</p>
