      <h2>Nationalist activist replies after former Israeli ambassadors call on EU to ban products from Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria.</h2>

      <p>Im Tirtzu CEO Alon Shwarzer called on Israeli institutions to shun a group of Israeli students who wrote a letter calling on the European Union to boycott all goods which come from Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria.</p>
      <p>"Israeli academics who sign the boycott petition against Israel make a living at the expense of the Israeli taxpayer they defame and call to boycott," Shwartzer stated.</p>
      <p>"The academic fight against BDS must be directed first and foremost to those who promote boycotts on the inside. Therefore, just as Bar Ilan University has convened a lecturer's disciplinary hearing due to a controversial statement, we call upon institutions where the lecturers call for a boycott to summon the lecturers before their immediate dismissal."</p>
      <p>Shwartzer responded to a letter published in the <i>Guardian</i> last week by a group which includes f<i>o</i>rmer Israeli ambassador to South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe Ilan Baruch, former Attorney General Professor Michael Ben-Yair, Vice-president of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities,<b> </b>Israel Prize recipient Professor David Harel, and other former ambassadors, politicians, and academics.</p>
      <p>The letter read: "Israeli settlements are the leading cause of human rights violations against Palestinians, and settlement expansion is destroying the possibility of a two-state solution. By banning goods that originate in Israeli settlements, Europe would help support the differentiation between Israel per se and settlements in the occupied territories."</p>
