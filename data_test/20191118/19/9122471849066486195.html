      <h1>Steelers WR JuJu Smith-Schuster Might Be Out vs. Cincinnati</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:40:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Myles Garrett’s helmet swinging hit on Mason Rudolph and subsequent brawl has dominated the NFL discussion since Thursday night. Lost in the shuffle is JuJu Smith-Schuster and the crushing helmet-to-helmet hit he absorbed, leading to his early exit from the game.</p>
      <p>The Steelers receiver found himself in between three Browns defenders, two of which made contact with Smith-Schuster’s helmet with their own helmet. Pittsburgh’s star receiver suffered a concussion as a result.</p>
      <p>According to the latest report from ESPN’s Adam Schefter, it appears Smith-Schuster is dealing with more than just a concussion. The receiver also suffered an undisclosed knee injury which may sideline him for Sunday’s game against the Bengals.</p>
      <p>Schefter offers the latest update in the tweet below.</p>

      <p>With Smith-Schuster’s status up in the air, the Steelers may be in some trouble. Sunday’s game against Cincinnati is a must-win for Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, the Steelers are still alive in the AFC playoff hunt. Baltimore is on its way to winning the AFC North Division. But the Steelers are currently battling for a wildcard spot. As a current 8-seed in the AFC, Pittsburgh will need some help and has to win on Sunday.</p>
      <p>As the week progresses, we’ll get a much better idea as to whether Smith-Schuster will play against the Bengals.</p>
