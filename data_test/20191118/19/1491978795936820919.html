      <h1>Saracens face daunting safety struggle after dropping appeal against penalties</h1>

        <i>• Saracens accept 35-point point deduction and £5.4m fine <br/>• Main sponsor Allianz questions whether to extend support</i>
      </p>
      <p>Saracens face the task of needing to win 10 of their 18 remaining league games to be certain of preserving their Premiership status following confirmation of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/saracens-docked-35-points-and-5m-fine-for-salary-cap-breach">35-point point deduction and £5.4m fine</a> for breaching salary cap regulations.</p>
      <p>With the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens">Saracens</a> owner, Nigel Wray, having accepted his club’s punishment for not fully declaring “co-investment” arrangements with players over the past three seasons, the champions have been sent crashing to the foot of the table and are on -22 points after four matches.</p>
      <p>Last season Newcastle were relegated with 31 points and this one is shaping up to be even more competitive. That leaves Saracens potentially needing a further 50 points to secure their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/premiership">Premiership</a> future, let alone qualify for the play-offs or Europe.</p>
      <p>With a large chunk of their squad, including the England captain, Owen Farrell, recovering from the World Cup and set to be absent during the Six Nations, it poses a unique challenge for the director of rugby, Mark McCall, and his coaches.</p>
      <p>Those who suggest their squad will weather the storm and still finish in the top six are overlooking the unaccustomed pressure of being 26 points adrift at the bottom of the league and the galvanising effect on every other bottom-half team.</p>
      <p>As they found in Paris on Sunday during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/17/racing-saracens-rugby-champions-cup-match-report">a 30-10 defeat by Racing 92</a>, rugby can be a merciless profession and Saracens’ next three league games further underline the difficulties ahead. Uncomfortable away matches at Bath and Exeter sandwiched between a visit from the leaders, Bristol, are not an obvious recipe for a relaxing Christmas and new year.</p>
      <p>Fail to win any of them and it is possible Saracens could kick off the new year even further behind the field. Their England contingent will then spend much of February and March in Six Nations mode before returning, if fit, for the final nine games of the season. It is possible seven of those matches will need to be won, particularly if current fellow stragglers Leicester and Wasps rediscover some form.</p>
      <p>A Premiership Rugby spokesman has also reiterated that, as things stand, the bottom side will definitely be relegated in June. There would be widespread outrage were it to be announced the league is being ring-fenced with Saracens floundering in bottom place.</p>
      <p>The England coach, Eddie Jones, is among those who can foresee bumpy times with Saracens players torn between club and country demands. “There may be some dislocation between Saracens players and the rest of the clubs. That’s a reality,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We may have to work to mend those relationships a bit harder and there might be some Saracens players who feel like they’ve got to play for their club instead of their country to make sure they don’t go down. We’ll weigh those up as they come about.”</p>
      <p>Saracens’ main sponsor, Allianz, has suggested there is no guarantee it will extend its backing in light of the salary cap furore.</p>
      <p>Wray, who had indicated the club would seek a review of the decision, has now accepted the club were remiss in not disclosing all the details of its business relationships with certain players. “I recognise the arrangements between myself and players … should have been brought to the attention of the salary cap manager for consultation prior to entering into them,” Wray said.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps we have done the wrong thing for the right reasons but we must now draw a line and come together as Saracens to fully support our players, our coaches and our hard-working staff.</p>
      <p>“We will shortly introduce robust independent governance measures acceptable to all, including the appointment to the Saracens board of a director who will oversee a new governance regime. I will continue as always to support the club financially to ensure there is no financial instability or uncertainty. In addition, we can confirm we are complying strictly with the salary cap regulations in the current season and will continue to work transparently with Premiership Rugby in this regard.”</p>
      <h3>Wales hit by Francis blow</h3>
      <p>The Wales prop Tomas Francis faces a battle to be fit for next year’s Six Nations after being ruled out for up to four months. Francis faces surgery on a shoulder injury he sustained in the World Cup semi-final defeat to South Africa.</p>
      <p>The absence of Francis would present a further blow to Wales who are already resigned to being without Jonathan Davies and Rhys Patchell for the tournament.</p>
