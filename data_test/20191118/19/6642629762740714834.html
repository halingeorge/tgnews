      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/qatar.html">Qatar</a> will charter two cruise liners to accommodate visiting football fans during the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/qatar-2022.html">2022 FIFA World Cup</a> as it prepares to host the global <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/football.html">football</a> tournament for the first time in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, which is tasked with the preparations for the month-long event, signed an agreement with the Swiss-based European company MSC Cruises on Monday, earmarking the ships with a combined capacity of 4,000 cabins.</p>
      <p>The vessels, berthed at the Doha port in the Qatari capital, will act as floating hotels during the tournament, a <a href="https://sc.qa/en/news/sc-signs-agreement-with-msc-cruises">statement</a> on its website said. </p>

      <p>"We are pleased to collaborate with MSC Cruises to deliver this unique accommodation option for fans in 2022," Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary-general for the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, said.</p>
      <p>"We are sure fans from all over the world will be excited at the prospect of staying on board a cruise ship, with a fabulous view of West Bay, and fast access to all the stadiums and fan zones," he added. </p>
      <p>Shuttle buses will be arranged to take fans from the cruise ships to Qatar's transport infrastructure, including the country's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/qatar-rolls-landmark-metro-public-190508104457971.html">first-ever metro service</a>, which started partial operations earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In addition to floating hotels, other accommodation options will include hotels, apartments and fan villages, the statement said.</p>
      <p>Qatar's Supreme Committee said it has completed more than 75 percent of the preparations for the tournament, including two stadiums: Khalifa International in Doha and Al Janoub in the southern city of Al Wakrah.</p>
      <p>Construction for six other stadiums with advanced open-air cooling technology is also <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/qatar-2022-world-cup-stadiums-181025142408471.html">under way</a>.</p>
      <p>The 32-team tournament kicks on November 21, 2022, and will run until December 18 - breaking with tradition with a winter schedule as it looks to avoid the scorching Doha summer heat.</p>
