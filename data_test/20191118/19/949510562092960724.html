      <p>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania House majority is giving its approval to a proposal to require the burial or cremation of fetal remains that end up in possession of a health care facility.</p>
      <p>The bill, modeled on Indiana legislation that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year, was sent to the state Senate on a vote of 123 to 76.</p>
      <p>Supporters framed it as giving parents greater say in the disposal of remains, while opponents argued it would harass abortion facilities and impinge on women’s health choices.</p>
      <p>The legislation says parents can decide to dispose of the remains outside a health care facility after an abortion or miscarriage.</p>
      <p>If they don’t, the facility must bury or cremate them.</p>
