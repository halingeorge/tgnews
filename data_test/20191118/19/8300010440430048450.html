It will be a long painful walk to class without him on Dec. 2," a friend said.<br/><br/>Gracie's best friend, Addison, who was wounded in the shooting and is now recovering at home, had a recorded message played for the crowd.<br/><br/>"To my friends and family and my Saugus Strong community, I really appreciate all the love and support. I'm so thankful for each and every one of you," she said.<br/><br/>Speakers praised students and community members for the show of strength even as they grieve.<br/><br/>Two students were killed and three other teens were wounded in the shooting on Nov. 14.<br/><br/>The suspect shot himself in the head and <a href="https://abc7.com/suspect-in-shooting-rampage-at-saugus-high-school-has-died/5699170/">died the next day.</a><br/><br/>Central Park has become a gathering place for those wishing to remember the victims.

      <p>Saugus High School is expected to remain closed until Dec. 2. Other schools in the district will reopen Monday.<br/><br/>The tragedy has hit many hard throughout the region.<br/><br/>"I have many friends at Saugus High School. It's tragic that this happened here," said Savannah Herrera, a Valencia High student. "We need to stop this because it has a huge impact. We can't be losing lives."<br/><br/>In the meantime, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department says it has investigated a number of online threats made against schools in the district. None of the threats are believed to be credible.<br/><br/>Students who were forced to leave items behind during the shooting will be able to retrieve their belongings on campus between 10 a.m. and noon Tuesday.<br/><br/>Optional activities will be held Wednesday and Thursday to help students with the healing process.</p>
