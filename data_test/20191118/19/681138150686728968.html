      <p>Pope, 27, put on the number 1 jersey for the Three Lions in their final Euro 2020 qualifying match against Kosovo in front of a sell-out Pristina crowd.</p>
      <p>But a matter of years ago it seemed an impossibility, especially after being released by boyhood-favourite Ipswich Town aged 16.</p>
      <p>A season ticket holder in his younger years, the Cambridgeshire-born lad called his release "the biggest disappointment" of his life, debating whether or not he had a future in football at all.</p>
      <p>It was then back to school for the disheartened youngster, who played for non-league Bury Town while studying business marketing at West Suffolk College. During that time he worked part-time as a milkman, before then League One Charlton snapped him up.</p>
      <p>Signing for the south London outfit, he sent a message to others like him to "never give up on your dreams".</p>
      <p>Six loans and 38 appearances for The Addicks later, the Premier League beckoned with Burnley and a three-year contract in 2016.</p>
      <p>Making his mark in the top flight the following season, he earned a call up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for the 2018 World Cup - although didn't make his international debut until June 7 that year as a 65th-minute substitute in a friendly against Costa Rica.</p>
      <p>Richard Wilkins, who worked with Pope at Bury Town and West Suffolk College, said at the time: "It's fantastic news for every young player who gets released at 16 and just shows if you keep working hard then people do take notice and dreams can come true."</p>
      <p>But as was becoming a common theme for Pope, it was not destined to be plain sailing as he suffered a dislocated shoulder in a Europa League qualifying match away to Aberdeen in July 2018. He later missed most of the season as a result.</p>
      <p>But as England looked to see off their qualifying campaign in style, Pope finally got the start he deserved.</p>
      <p>Russell Ward, chairman of Bury Town Football Club, said: "We at Bury Town Football Club are all really pleased with the success Nick Pope has achieved.</p>
      <p>"He always worked really hard at Bury Town and we are not surprised how well he is doing.</p>
      <p>"We all wish him the best in his future career and look forward to watching him play for England."</p>
      <p>West Suffolk College head of sport Anthony Harvey said: "We are delighted for Nick to have made his full England debut - what an amazing achievement!</p>
      <p>"He played brilliantly and as a college we are so proud of him, he has set a great legacy that our current sports academy students can aspire to. We wish him the best of luck as he continues this amazing journey."</p>
