      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equal weighted and actively managed portfolio.</li>
        <li>A focus on small-cap stocks with decent volume and that pay a dividend.</li>
        <li>Stocks are ranked according to income, growth, and valuation metrics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I am happy to announce a new addition to the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4272983-small-cap-triple-threat-portfolio-second-quarter-update">Small Cap Triple-Threat Portfolio</a> - <b>Cardinal Energy</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRLFF">OTC:CRLFF</a>)[TSX:CJ]. Of note, all financials and prices are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise note.</p>
      <p>Full disclosure - I was very hesitant on adding another oil &amp; gas stock to the mix. <b>Total Energy</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOT">TOT</a>) [TSX:TOT] was one of the original holdings of the portfolio and its performance has been a drag. Since being added, it has lost approximately 43% of its value and holds the distinction of being the portfolio.</p>
      <p>The entire sector has been decimated and significant headwinds remain. However, after looking into the company a little be deeper, I saw an undervalued junior producer with a dividend that was well covered.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Overview</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Cardinal Energy one of the smaller independent oil &amp; gas companies. It is a Western Canadian pureplay with three operations in Alberta and two in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>As a junior producer, the company is subject to significant volatility. As of writing, the company is trading at $2.00 per share. This is near its 52-week low of $1.80 and at a 75% discount to its 52-week high of $3.50 per share.</p>
      <p>This past week, the company released third quarter results in which it missed on earnings ($0.00 vs $0.02). Revenue came in at $95.48 million, down 15.9% from the third quarter of 2018. All things considered however, it was a decent quarter for the company amidst significant headwinds.</p>
      <p>The company delivered strong adjusted funds from operations [AFFO] of $27.6 million (+2%) despite the Alberta oil curtailment that led to a slight decrease (-4%) in production. Through the first nine-months of the year, it has generated $36.4 million in free cash flow which is being used to pay down debt and buyback shares.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>A top value stock</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Without question, Cardinal Energy is a value stock. True, most oil &amp; gas companies can be considered cheap, yet Cardinal's undervaluation sticks out.</p>
      <p>Although it is relevant to note that Cardinal hasn't been this cheap since it went public in 2014, most of its oil &amp; gas peers are also trading at a significant discount to historical valuations. It is par for the course these days.</p>
      <p>Where it sticks out is relative valuation as compared to its peers.</p>

      <p>Based on these numbers, it is no surprise that the company showed up on the screener as a top value stock.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Not for those looking for stability</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Cardinal just made the cut with respect to the dividend. If a stable and reliable dividend is an absolute must, then Cardinal is not for you. In the past year, it has both cut and raised the dividend.</p>
      <p>Last December, Cardinal announced it was cutting its monthly dividend from $0.035 to $0.01 per share. This past July, it raised the dividend by $0.005 and it is now paying a dividend of $0.015 per share. This is still a 57% drop from where it was a year ago.</p>
      <p>So how can Cardinal Energy show up as a triple-threat stock? The screener is not predicated entirely on dividend growth. Although it is a component, it also considers yield and the safety of the dividend based on the company's financial position.</p>
      <p>This is where Cardinal Energy ranked highly. The company currently yield's a hefty 8.82% and the dividend accounts for only 61% of earnings through the first nine-months of the year. More importantly, the payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO is only 13.5% and it accounts for a reasonable 35% of free cash flow [FCF].</p>
      <p>The December dividend cut has enabled it to focus on debt reduction, still pay out a dividend and buyback shares with FCF. In the first nine months of the year, it has repurchased 3% of shares outstanding for cancellation.</p>
      <p>With respect to growth, Cardinal also just made the cut. The company has targeted 5-10% production growth and the expectation is for average revenue growth in the mid-teens over the next couple of years.</p>
      <p>There are 13 analysts covering the company (7 buys and 6 holds) and they have an average one-year price target of $2.39 per share. This implies 20% upside from today's share price.</p>
      <p>This is all assuming of course, the price of oil remains stable. Therein lies the significant risk with a company like Cardinal Energy. As a junior producer, it is more susceptible to a crash in oil prices. It also less likely to survive a prolonged bear market.</p>
      <p>With Cardinal's inclusion, here is the revised <i>Small Cap Triple-Threat Portfolio.</i></p>
