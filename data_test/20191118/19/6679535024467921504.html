      <h1>Runway resurfacing: five services cancelled from Kochi airport</h1>
      <h2>Resurfacing work on the airport runway from November 20 to March 28</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:54:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>An international service to Maldives and four services in the domestic sector from the Cochin International Airport will be cancelled between November 20 and March 28, due to a four-month-long resurfacing work of the runway during day time.</p>
      <p>No flight will operate from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the period. Almost all services were already rescheduled to the available operational time from 6 p.m. to 10 a.m.</p>
      <p>Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) had started the preparatory work for the runway-resurfacing project well in advance, to ensure minimal cancellation of services, with the cooperation of the airlines concerned, says an official press release.</p>
      <p>The winter schedule, which took effect from October-end, has already adjusted services to the available operational time. Subsequently, only one services in the international sector – to Maldives, operated by Spice Jet — and four services in the domestic sector, will be cancelled.</p>
      <h3>Check-in time</h3>
      <p>The seventh busiest airport in the country, the Cochin airport handles 240 aircraft movements and 30,000 passengers a day.</p>
      <p>It expects a rush during early morning and early evening hours, as the operational time will be reduced from 24 to 16 hours.</p>
      <p>In view of this, CIAL will increase the check-in time to three hours for domestic passengers and four hours for international passengers.</p>
      <h3>Help from agencies</h3>
      <p>Arrangements are in place to ensure hassle-free passenger movement, with the help of Customs, Immigration and ground-handling agencies.</p>
      <p>The CISF, which manages airport security has deployed 100 additional security men, raising their total strength to 950.</p>
      <p>The agency has also decided to deploy another 400 security personnel in the weeks to come.</p>
      <p>The airport, which started functioning in 1999, underwent first runway resurfacing work in 2009. The resurfacing is done to ensure the desired level of friction to facilitate precision landing for the aircraft.</p>
      <p>An area of five lakh sq. m, comprising of the 3,400-metre-long runway having width of 60 metres, the taxiway and taxiway links will be overhauled during the period.</p>
      <h3>Lighting system</h3>
      <p>Simultaneously, CIAL will realign the lighting system from the existing CAT-1 to CAT-3, which will see the fixing of central-line lights every 15 meters, apart from introducing new lights at touch-down zones, and parking bays.</p>
      <p>The total project cost is ₹150 crore.</p>
