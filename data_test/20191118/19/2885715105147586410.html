      <p>SIX DAYS after a partially decomposed body of a man was recovered from the Dev river in Waghodia, the Local Crime Branch, on Monday, arrested two men in connection with his murder.</p>
      <p>Two days after the incident, the deceased was identified as Ganpat Vasava (34), a labourer who lived with his sister in Karjan.</p>
      <p>The accused were identified as Ajay Vasava, Ganpat’s uncle, and Ganesh Chunar, Ganpat’s friend. No missing persons report was filed as the deceased worked as a contractual labourer at a bricks kiln in Dediapada taluka of Narmada district.</p>
      <p>The police had narrowed down on the accused through Call Data Records of Ganpat’s phone and active mobile numbers at the crime scene.</p>
      <p>“Ajay was upset with Ganpat as he had fought with the caretaker of their farm land in Karjan. On November 11, both Ajay and Ganesh took Ganpat with them on the pretext of partying, got drunk and began arguing over the issue. They hit him with a rock and wooden log on his head in a fit of rage and smashed his face. Then, they disposed off his body in the river,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kalpesh Solanki.</p>
      <p>Ganpat’s body was found in the river on November 12, with his hands tied and his face decomposed beyond recognition. The police had found a wooden log with blood stains in a nearby graveyard and registered a case of murder against unknown people.</p>
      <p>On further investigation, they had also found a trail of blood leading to the riverbed, indicating that Ganpat had been dragged from the graveyard till the river, police said.</p>
      <p>Both Ajay and Ganesh are history sheeters and have been arrested in cases of rioting and assault. The latter has served a jail term twice in connection with two separate murders.</p>
