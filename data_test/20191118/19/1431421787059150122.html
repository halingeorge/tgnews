      <h1>Turkey Will Launch Another Syria Operation if Area Not Cleared of Kurdish YPG, FM Says</h1>
      <h2>Mevlut Cavusoglu quoted in Turkish state-owned Anadolu agency saying the U.S. and Russia have yet to do what was required under a brokered agreement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:00:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968129" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Turkey’s foreign minister said Ankara would launch a new military operation in northeast Syria if the area was not cleared of what he called terrorists, state-owned Anadolu agency reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was quoted as saying that United States and Russia had not done what was required under agreements that halted a Turkish offensive against the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-kurdistan-1.5606885">Kurdish </a>YPG militia in northeastern Syria last month.</p>
      <p>The deals stipulated that the YPG would be removed from a swathe of land bordering <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/turkey">Turkey </a>in northeastern <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria">Syria</a>.</p>
      <p>Cavusoglu called on Washington and Moscow on Monday to do what is necessary under the deals.</p>
      <p>“If we do not obtain a result, we will do what is necessary, just as we launched the operation after trying with the U.S.,” Cavusoglu was quoted as saying, referring to work with Washington to remove the YPG from the area before Turkey launched its cross-border incursion on October 9.</p>
      <p>Ankara views the YPG, the main component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that helped the United States defeat Islamic State, as a terrorist group with links to Kurdish militants on Turkish soil.</p>
