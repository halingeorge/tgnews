      <h1>Claudio Yacob and Zach Clough back in action for Nottingham Forest but how did they perform?</h1>
      <h2>Two of Forest's fringe players were involved in a behind-close-doors friendly with local rivals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Claudio Yacob and Zach Clough were part of a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> team that won 3-2 against Notts County in a behind closed doors friendly on Monday.</p>
      <p>The game, played at the Nigel Doughty Academy was a side largely made up of young players, overseen by Jimmy Gilligan and Chris Cohen, with Clough and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/olympiacos-show-interest-nottingham-forest-2993930">Yacob</a> along with Toby Edser all given run-outs against the Magpies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/notts-county-defender-alex-lacey-3551135">Notts assistant manager Neil Cox took</a> charge of Forest’s cross-city rivals in a game which gave the National League outfit an opportunity to get minutes into senior players coming back from injury, and praised the Reds for helping get the game on.</p>
      <p>“Nottingham Forest have looked after us this morning and put on a good pitch with the weather being bad,” Cox said, having seen Max Ram, Ethan Stewart and Will Swan score for the hosts.</p>

      <p>Yacob and Clough have yet to feature under new head coach Sabri Lamouchi, with the Argentinian’s last outing coming at QPR in April, while former Bolton man <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/sport-opinion/zach-clough-can-still-future-3283008">Clough hasn’t played for the Reds since an FA Cup game</a> at Hull last January and has been out on loan at Rochdale and Wanderers.</p>
      <p>Forest’s Under-23 haven’t tasted action since losing at Southampton earlier this month, and saw last Friday’s game at Hull City called off due to the weather.</p>
      <p>They're next in action this Friday when they host Bolton at the City Ground.</p>
