      <p>Stressing about getting the perfect Nintendo Switch deal during Black Friday? You may not need to wait until the big day to get Nintendo’s latest console! Walmart is offering a Switch bundle ahead of Black Friday and grabbing it now means you don’t have to deal with digital or physical lines come next week.</p>
      <p>If you head to Walmart’s website, you can get a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/co/Nintendo-Switch-Console-with-Minecraft-Game/842043295">Nintendo Switch console and Minecraft for $298.60</a>. It’s essentially the normal price of the Switch, plus a free copy of Minecraft to boot! Given that the only other Nintendo Switch bundle announced for US Black Friday is an older console with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it might be best to grab this instead of dealing with the holiday rush.</p>
      <p>This Walmart bundle comes with the new Nintendo Switch model, which boasts a higher battery life than the launch model of the system. You can choose between the Red/Blue Joy-Cons or the Grey Joy-Cons, and you’ll get a copy of Minecraft to go with the system.</p>
      <p>Of course, if you get a Nintendo Switch, you’ll want more games to go with the new console, and other retailers will have deals on Nintendo Switch titles. In fact, Amazon US currently has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01MS6MO77?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for $43.99</a>, which is cheaper than its price during Black Friday. You really can’t go wrong with the latest Zelda title! Meanwhile, you’ll have to wait until Black Friday itself, but if you do you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Just-Dance-2020-Nintendo-Switch-Standard/dp/B07SK37PK2?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">Just Dance 2020 for $26.66</a>. Finally, if Mario is more your speed, at Walmart you can grab <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Super-Mario-Odyssey-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496590741/56011600">Super Mario Odyssey for $49.94</a>.</p>
