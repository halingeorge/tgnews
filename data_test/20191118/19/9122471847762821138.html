      <h1>Kirby Smart Apologizes For What He Said After Beating Auburn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:21:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Georgia head coach Kirby Smart had plenty of reason to be excited in Saturday’s 21-14 win over Auburn. His ‘Dawgs had just beaten their third ranked team of the season, clinching a spot in the SEC Championship Game for the third year in a row in the process.</p>
      <p>But Smart may have been just a little too excited after the game.</p>
      <p>When interviewed after the game about how it felt, he used an expletive and said, “I told them, ‘How ’bout them (expletive) Dogs!'”</p>

      <p>While plenty of Georgia fans were likely delighted to see their coach so excited, the broadcast network and the FCC probably weren’t too thrilled.</p>
      <p>At his Monday press conference, Smart apologized for his “choice of words.”</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28108897/georgia-coach-kirby-smart-apologizes-using-expletive-beating-auburn">ESPN</a>, Smart said the comment was “not indicative of what I stand for.” He joked that his wife gave him an earful when he got home later.</p>
      <p>Hopefully Smart’s wife didn’t make him wash his mouth out with soap. But a fine could be forthcoming.</p>
      <p>Georgia fans will be quick to forgive their fourth-year head coach, though.</p>
      <p>The ‘Dawgs now control their own destiny in the College Football Playoff race. If they go 12-1 with an SEC title win, there’s no way they won’t be in the national title race next month.</p>
