      <h1>Pompeo expected to announce US softening position on Israel's Jewish settlements - RTRS</h1>

      <p>According to a Reuters news, the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who is expected to speak later today, will likely announce that the United States is softening its position on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, a Trump administration official said on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Pompeo is expected to say the administration of President Donald Trump will no longer abide by a 1978 State Department legal opinion that the settlements were "inconsistent with international law," according to the official. The move is likely to be welcomed by right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and anger the Palestinians, as well as other countries seeking to resolve the Middle East conflict," the news reported. </p>
