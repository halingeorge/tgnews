      <h2>AIADMK will win in 2021: Minister</h2>

      <p>Mocking actor Rajinikanth’s statement that a ‘miracle’ was waiting to happen, senior AIADMK leader and Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar on Monday said the miracle will be the AIADMK retaining power after the 2021 Assembly polls.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Mr. Jayakumar said his party neither believed in miracles nor luck, and was only dependent on the people who, he hoped, will vote the AIADMK into power in the 2021 Assembly polls.</p>
      <p>When asked why his party was constantly under attack, he said the AIADMK was doing well, and hence, was “naturally prone” to criticism. “They want to become big [players] only by attacking us. But they cannot come close to the AIADMK,” the Minister said.</p>
      <p>The AIADMK had grown thanks to the efforts of party founder M.G. Ramachandran, Mr. Jayakumar said. “Our leader did not come with <i>athisayam</i> [miracle] or <i>adhristham </i>[luck],” he added.</p>
      <p>When asked if actors Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan will form a political alliance to challenge the AIADMK, Mr. Jayakumar said he will wait for Mr. Rajinikanth to first launch a party, something the Minister said the actor had been bragging about for years.</p>
      <p>“Let actor Rajinikanth start a party first, and then, let us see whether those two actors come together. Even if they come together, let us see what their principles are in public life. Then, we will comment [on the issue],” he said.</p>
