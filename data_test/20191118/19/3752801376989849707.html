      <p>A leading opposition figure in Niger who returned from self-imposed exile last week was jailed on Monday to serve out the rest of his time for a conviction of baby smuggling, his family told AFP.</p>
      <p>Hama Amadou, 69, who had flown home last Thursday after his mother died, "was incarcerated early today in Filingue," 180km north of the capital Niamey, a relative said.</p>
      <p>"He went to court voluntarily and was taken to prison."</p>
      <p>A former premier and parliamentary speaker, Amadou has been nicknamed "the Phoenix" for his political comebacks.</p>
      <p>In November 2015, he was arrested on his return from abroad and charged with baby-trafficking - a case that supporters said was trumped-up.</p>
      <p>He campaigned for the March 2016 presidential elections from behind bars, gaining 17.7% of first-round votes behind President Mahamadou Issoufou, who won 48.4 percent.</p>
      <p>He was released on medical grounds four days before the runoff ballot, flew to France and remained abroad until his return last week.</p>
      <p>In March 2017, 20 people, including Amadou, were convicted in the case, which allegedly entailed smuggling babies from Nigeria via Benin for wealthy couples in Niger.</p>
      <p>He was given a 12-month sentence in absentia, of which eight months have still to be served, after time spent in prison is taken into account. One of his wives was also sentenced.</p>
      <p>In August this year, Amadou was named by the Nigerien Democratic Movement (Moden), the country's main opposition party, to be its candidate in the next presidential election, due in December 2020.</p>
      <p>Issoufou, a former prime minister, has been president since 2011.</p>
      <p>His country has a history of political volatility and has only had a multi-party democracy since 1990.</p>
      <p>The impoverished Sahel state has one of the lowest rates of development in the world. Three-quarters of the population live on less than $2 a day.</p>
      <p>Amadou, after visiting his mother's grave, spent the weekend greeting a large number of visitors to his home, his family said.</p>
      <p>They included supporters but also members of the Nigerien government and civil society, who came to express their condolence for his loss.</p>
      <p>He even spoke by phone with Issoufou, one of whose wives, Malika Issoufou, went to his home, said a relative.</p>
      <p><b>Uncertain future</b>Â </p>
      <p>Analysts said that Amadou's political future remained unclear.</p>
      <p>An expert on constitutional law, Amadou Boubacar, said that even if he served the entirety of his sentence before the December 2020 election, he would still be legally ineligible for a tilt at the presidency.</p>
      <p>"Under the law, anyone sentenced to a prison term equal to or greater than one year is not eligible," Boubacar said.</p>
      <p>"Even a presidential pardon is not enough. There would have to be a law amnestying baby-smuggling in order to annul the sentence."</p>
      <p>In that context, Amadou's future could largely depend on a "political dialogue" promised last month by Prime Minister Brigi Rafini, Boubacar said.</p>
      <p>A push for reconciliation could favour concessions for Amadou, who since his return has notably called for the easing of tensions.</p>
      <p>Officially, the "dialogue" aims at "calming the political climate" ahead of the presidential ballot, with discussions on future elections, Niger's electoral commission and access to the media.</p>
      <p>Rafini said an "assembly" of 30 people from Niger's political parties, plus five from trade unions and three from civil society, would be named shortly to conduct the month-long forum.</p>
      <p>Representatives from the UN, the European Union, a non-partisan American NGO called the National Democratic Institute will take part, as will local religious leaders and traditional chiefs.</p>
