      <h1>TSB lacked ‘common sense’ before IT glitch, says report</h1>
      <h2>Board failure to ensure upgrade was ‘mission ready’ contributed to outage hitting 2m customers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:51:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:51</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Jenkins, David Crow</a></address>
      <p>An investigation into last year’s IT meltdown at TSB has concluded that the bank’s board of directors failed to show “common sense” in the run-up to the doomed upgrade, said people briefed on the report.</p>
      <p>The independent probe conducted by law firm Slaughter and May will be published on Tuesday, more than a year after the IT failure locked out 2m account holders.</p>
      <p>“While the TSB board asked a number of pertinent questions, there were certain additional common sense challenges which [they] did not put to the executive,” said one person who had seen a summary of the report.</p>
      <p>The person said the board should have done more to ensure the IT upgrade was “mission ready”.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4232b12e-b741-11e8-bbc3-ccd7de085ffe">meltdown </a>at TSB, which is owned by Spain’s Banco Sabadell, was one of the worst in UK banking history and highlighted the difficulties of implementing IT projects for banks, which tend to be run using a patchwork of arcane computer infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The fallout from the debacle caused friction between the bank’s owners in Spain and its largely British board of directors.</p>
      <p>The person briefed on the report added: “In the lead-up to ‘go-live’, the TSB board should have done more to assess — and should have provided more challenge to — executives’ explanations [on] the adequacy of testing.”</p>
      <p>However, one person close to TSB said the “common sense” criticism was aimed at just one aspect of the migration. The IT failure was a complex event that was caused by a range of flaws in the bank’s systems, the person said.</p>
      <p>The board took evidence not just from executives but also from third-party suppliers and expert advisers before signing off on the upgrade, they added.</p>
      <p>Slaughter and May’s report was completed at the end of last month and has been sent to the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, said one person briefed on the process.</p>
      <p>In its results statement released in February, TSB said the design of the new computer system was “sound” but that its deployment was problematic.</p>
      <p>At the time, the bank said it had identified a series of interconnected issues that were responsible for the IT failure, including the capacity of its infrastructure and “some aspects of coding”.</p>
      <p>TSB said: “We have now received the review into TSB’s 2018 migration carried out by the law firm, Slaughter and May. The TSB board is reviewing it, has shared it with UK regulators and will provide a further update in due course.”</p>
      <p>The meltdown followed a scheduled weekend shutdown of TSB’s online and mobile banking applications while it transferred 1.3bn customer records from its former parent, Lloyds Banking Group.</p>
      <p>Lloyds was forced to carve out and sell <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be2ce67e-f67d-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654">TSB </a>by EU regulators as a condition of the government bailout it received after its takeover of HBOS during the financial crisis.</p>
