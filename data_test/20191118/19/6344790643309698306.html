      <p>We have a new song for you to check out from the upcoming film adaptation of the famed Broadway musical, <b><i>Cats</i></b>. The musical was written by <b>Andrew Lloyd Webber</b>, and he has contributed the music for a new song – with lyrics by cast member <b>Taylor Swift</b> – for the film as well. This will be the only brand new song included in the film, with the other music from the original returning.</p>
      <p>The song seems to fit in with the other songs in the musical, and Swift performs it beautifully. I have always liked the songs from <i>Cats</i>, but I don’t know how well it’s all going to translate on film. But for now, listen to the new song, and let us know what you think.</p>
