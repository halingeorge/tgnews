      <p>Accra, Nov. 18, GNA - Angela F. Eke Foundation Ghana, a humanitarian organisation that believes in clean environments as an important part of human existence, has embarked on a four-hour clean-up exercise at the La Beach in Accra.</p>
      <p>The exercise, which was supported by the Eternal Sacred Order Cherubim and Seraphim (ESOCS) Church and Save Our Beaches Ghana, witnessed the cleaning of the La beach, ridding it of plastic and rubber waste littered around.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Ghana News Agency (GNA) during the exercise, Elder Eke Chukwueke, Executive Director of Angela F. Eke Foundation, said considering the effects of climate change, they believed that through their environment-based projects, they could contribute their quota to the fight against climate change and help preserve the natural world.</p>
      <p>He said being an organisation that believed in the natural world, they were of the view that beaches, and for that matter the seas, were an essential part of the natural world; hence, it was important that beaches were kept clean, safe and hygienic for all.</p>
      <p>“When we came here, you realised that the garbage around the beaches has polluted the sea; and the filth has also degraded the environment, this affects life in and around the sea,” he added.</p>
      <p>Elder Chukwueke told GNA that the Foundation had plans of extending the project to other beaches in the country.</p>
      <p>The Executive Director noted however that, doing a project like this demanded a lot of time and resources, and so they were engaging other stakeholders to come on board to ensure that, the ultimate goal of seeing garbage-free beaches in Ghana was achieved.</p>
      <p>He called on the Government, civil society, corporate bodies and the public to support this course.</p>
      <p>“Let’s not forget that, the Government has plans of making Accra the cleanest city in Africa soon; the Angela F. Eke Foundation is ready to collaborate with the Government and other agencies to ensure that this objective is achieved”.</p>
      <p>Mr Chibuzor Anoruo, Youth Leader of ESOCS Church, who described the project as laudable, noted that such initiatives provided the opportunity to give back to society and to help in making the environment clean.</p>
      <p>He said the aim of the project was not just about cleaning beaches, but also to propagate the gospel of cleanliness and the need to educate the masses on the need to preserve the natural world, adding that “the church is willing to partner any organization to achieve that goal”.</p>
      <p>Mr Paa Kwesi Wilson, Executive Secretary of Save Our Beaches Ghana, also told GNA that their vision was to ensure that public beaches were clean, as such they collaborated with the assemblies and coastal communities, to keep the beaches clean.</p>
      <p>He said the problem with filthy beaches was attitudinal, and so there was the need to embark on a sensitisation campaign, adding that “just the clean-up exercise is not enough, what we must do frequently is education, else the problem will still persist”.</p>
      <p>He said another challenged they encountered was funding, saying, this had to do with getting people involved and getting logistics, to effectively achieve their objectives.</p>
