      <h1>Liverpool fans react as Sander Berge makes intriguing Anfield comments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:15:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Genk star Sander Berge has been linked with Liverpool ever since reports suggested Jurgen Klopp had been impressed with his Champions League displays – and now the player has spoken about Klopp’s side, prompting reaction from Liverpool fans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/zGzbgK/klopp-meldte-interesse-for-sander-berge-paa-anfield">A report from Norwegian outlet VG</a> earlier this season claims that Klopp has been impressed with Berge, and stopped the 21-year-old midfielder in the Anfield tunnell after Liverpool had won 2-1 in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>It is hardly surprising that Klopp was impressed. Berge is quickly becoming a crucial part of Genk’s side, starting 20 of Genk’s 21 league and cup matches this season and even captaining the side in a league game against KAS Eupen.</p>
      <p>Now, Berge – who already has 19 caps for Norway – <a href="https://www.tv2.no/sport/10988016/">told TV2</a> that Virgil van Dijk waited for him in the tunnel at Anfield to swap shirts. He applauded the Reds favourite, dropping a hint that he would be open to a move to Liverpool given the previous link.</p>
      <p>“They respected us and took us seriously,” <a href="https://www.tv2.no/sport/10988016/">he told TV2</a>. “They should be praised for that. I had asked Stefan Johansen to swap shirts with van Dijk. Van Dijk was waiting for me in the tunnel for five to ten minutes, so he stood there and we could do it. These are small details, but it shows how great people the Liverpool players are.”</p>
      <p>Berge has been linked with a whole host of Premier League clubs as his burgeoning reputation continues to catch the attention of the biggest clubs in England’s top division. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10291207/liverpool-25m-transfer-genk-prodigy-sander-berge/">The Sun claim</a> he is worth £25million.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have many options in midfield but a contract for James Milner has yet to be agreed while PSG are being linked with a surprise move for Adam Lallana. Naby Keita has failed to get going, and Reds fans reckon Berge is coming to Anfield.</p>
