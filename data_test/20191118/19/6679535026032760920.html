      <p>With proper training and motivation, the youth of Kerala can take on responsible assignments and respond well to situations, Speaker P.Sreeramakrishnan said here on Monday.</p>
      <p>Inaugurating the passing out parade of the Kerala Voluntary Youth Action Force formed by the Kerala State Youth Welfare Board, he said the exemplary social commitment and readiness to take on challenges of the youth was on display during the floods that ravaged the State twice.</p>
      <p>He said the voluntary youth action force had the potential to emerge as the nucleus of voluntary youth movements in Kerala and the country as a whole.</p>
      <p>Mr.Sreeramakrishnan also released the guidelines for the action force.</p>
      <p>He, along with Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran, received the salute at the passing out parade of 405 volunteers who completed the second phase of training.</p>
      <p>The volunteers will, in turn, train other youth at the panchayat level. Apart from physical training, the new volunteers will also be equipped to take up programmes on water conservation, environmental protection and waste disposal.</p>
      <p>Youth Welfare Board member Santhosh Kala presided. Board vice chairman P.Biju and Youth Commission chairperson Chintha Jerome were among those present at the function.</p>
