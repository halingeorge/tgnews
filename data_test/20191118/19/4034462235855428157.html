      <h1>Volkswagen ID.3 Makes Another Case Why EVs Are The Future</h1>
      <h2>Nothing like finding ways to save money.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:20:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Although the all-new Volkswagen ID.3, revealed at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show, won't be sold in the US, a crossover version of it will be. <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/volkswagen-previews-americas-electric-id-crossover">Potentially dubbed the ID.4 or ID.4 X</a>, both vehicles ride on the same all-electric platform and share all essential components such as batteries and electric motors. Volkswagen has committed to spending some <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/vw-commits-70-billion-to-an-electric-car-future">$72 billion on future EV development</a> and associated programs, meaning it's going all-in with electrification. Sooner or later, combustion engines may very well be a thing of the past. And then there's this all-important piece of information: the ID.3 is cheaper to build than the outgoing e-Golf.</p>
      <p>VW CEO Herbert Diess stated this fact to investors this week, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-electric/vw-ceo-says-new-id-3-car-40-cheaper-to-build-than-electric-golf-idUSKBN1XS1BN">Reuters</a> report. "If you focus on an electric platform, all in all, it accounts for a 40% reduction against the predecessor electric Golf," Diess said. "Most of it from cells and the battery system. Around 5-10% comes from dedicating an entire plant to electric vehicles."</p>

      <p>Not only does the ID.3 cost less to build than the e-Golf, which is not overly surprising given it had to be specially outfitted with EV guts, this now provides VW with confidence it can successfully shift from combustion-engined vehicles to electric cars without losing money.</p>
      <p>The Volkswagen Group, so far, has two electric vehicle platforms, MEB and J1. The MEB platform underpins the ID.3 while J1 serves as the basis for the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/taycan">Porsche Taycan</a>. Premium Platform Electric, or PPE, is currently in development.</p>

      <p>Some 20 million of the electric vehicles VW plans to sell across all of its brands annually will ride on MEB. The upcoming VW bus, for example, is also MEB-based. Internal combustion, for VW, isn't going anywhere just yet. The automaker also plans to sell nearly 6 million hybrid vehicles by 2029.</p>
      <p>The transition to an all-electric future, at least with VW, is already underway and the ID.3 is already proving itself financially viable from a production standpoint.</p>
