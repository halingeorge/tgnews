      <h1>Corpn. to resume work on widening congested stretches</h1>
      <h2>Kaliammankoil Street to be the first of 14 roads to be taken up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:49:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Chennai Corporation is set to resume work on the project of widening congested roads across the city.</p>
      <p>As many as 14 roads are expected to be widened, as per the resolution of the Chennai Corporation Council in 2014. However, after completing 1,150 m of the 3.1-km Kaliammankoil Street last year, the civic body suspended the work.</p>
      <p>The civic body has decided to resume the work on acquisition of land from private owners along stretches such as Kaliammankoil Street. A senior official said the proposal for administrative sanction for the acquisition of 1,160 sq.m. of land along Kaliammankoil Street has been sent.</p>
      <p>The government has also given permission to widen stretches such as Sardar Patel Road and Strahans Road, utilising government land along the stretches. “The widening of roads will be done in a phased manner. The Commissioner of Land Administration, through the Collector, will acquire land under Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation &amp; Resettlement Act, 2013. The cost of land acquisition will be fully borne by the Chennai Corporation,” said an official.</p>
      <p>After widening the stretch in Koyambedu and Senchery, land acquisition in Virugambakkam will begin. A total of 13,039 sq.m of private land in Virugambakkam, 4,383 sq m in Senchery and 2,469 in Koyambedu will also be acquired in the next phase.</p>
      <p>Kaliammankoil Street is a vital link connecting Jawaharlal Nehru Salai and NSK Salai, serving as a main access for Koyambedu Bus Terminus, Market and CMRL depot. The road would be widened from 9.6 metre to 27 metre.</p>
      <h3>TDR opposed</h3>
      <p>“The private land owners have formed an association and have been opposing the concept of TDR (Transfer of Development Rights). They have stated that the time is not ripe for marketing of TDR to other parties because of slugishness of the real estate market,” said an official.</p>
      <p>According to data compiled by the Corporation, more than 50% of the land area of the private properties along the roads will be acquired for the project.</p>
