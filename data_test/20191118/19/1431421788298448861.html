      <p>Iran-aligned rebels have hijacked a vessel south of the Red Sea, the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-saudi-arabia-1.5599258">Saudi Arabia</a>’s state-run news agency quoted coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki as saying that Houthi rebels seized the vessel while it was towing a South Korean drilling rig the previous day.</p>
      <p>Al-Malki said the “attack” threatens vital shipping routes in the Bab al-Mandeb strait, used for oil shipments from the Gulf to Europe, as well as goods from Asia to Europe.</p>
      <p>In a meeting with the South Korean ambassador to <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-yemen-1.5599311">Yemen</a>, Yemeni Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdullah al-Hadrami sharply condemned the seizure of the ship and called for its immediate release, according to a government statement.</p>
