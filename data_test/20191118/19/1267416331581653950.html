      <h1>146 security flaws found in pre-loaded Android apps around the globe</h1>
      <h2>Fortunately, most of these aren't on Canadian devices</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:38:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>A U.S. based cybersecurity firm has published a report detailing 146 new Android security flaws found within first-party apps and services.</p>
      <p>While a vast majority of these services are from Asian manufacturers, some global heavyweights like Samsung and Asus are included in the roundup.</p>
      <p>What’s concerning about this report is that these are pre-installed apps and services, so users can’t get rid of the affected code on their phones.</p>
      <p>The Cybersecurity firm is called <a href="https://www.kryptowire.com/android-firmware-2019/">Kryptowire</a> and was contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>

      <p>Most of the affected devices are brands that don’t usually make it to Canada, such as Xiaomi, BQ, Doogee and more.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/146-bugs-preinstalled-android-phones/">Wired</a> </i>has reported that Samsung claims two of the vulnerabilities on its devices are the handiwork of contracted developers, and the other four are rendered harmless by the Android Security Framework.</p>
      <p>Kryptowire doesn’t believe Samsung’s claim, according to <i>Wired</i>.</p>
