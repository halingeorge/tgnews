      <p>Top Apple exec Phil Schiller seemed to have a good time seeing Bruce Springsteen Sunday night at the Stone Pony club in Asbury Park, New Jersey, a gig that was a benefit for Boston College. Using an iPhone 11 Pro, he took a fantastic, up-close photograph of The Boss and shared it on <a href="https://twitter.com/pschiller/status/1196134329178562560">Twitter.</a> The level of detail, for instance on Mr. Springstreeen’s face and picking out the instruments behind, is really is quite stunning. [Edit: we updated the story to reflect where the gig was held. Thanks to Paul Kent for the heads up!]</p>
