      <p>Many of Frank Lampard’s former team-mates, and indeed past rivals, will tell you that he was always destined to become a manager.</p>
      <p>That he would be in charge of Chelsea in just his second season from the sidelines was less obvious but as another club legend, Bobby Tambling, told <b>football.london</b> last month: “Some people just have it all mapped out. Frank is one of them.”</p>
      <p>As a player at the beginning of this decade Lampard carried the air of a leader. Not in a vocal sense, even though he was not a shrinking violet either, but in leading by example. The attention to detail, his dedication to stay late after training and the incessant effort to improve his game – stories about the work ethic that defined his playing career are nothing new but those characteristics were always going to translate well to management.</p>
      <p>It is odd to look back now and consider that Lampard, the player, was not universally loved despite being Chelsea’s record goalscorer. Much of that was down to the failures of England’s hyped up Golden Generation but there was also an outside perception, from fans other clubs, of Lampard as an exceptional goalscorer but unexceptional in other facets of the game.</p>
      <p>That is unfair. He has always been the first to admit that there were better technicians and better athletes but his application was comparable to few and he was in many ways a players’ player.</p>
      <p>Another factor for some of the more fickle Chelsea fans was the manner in which he ended up at Manchester City via a controversial transfer to New York City. That rankled with some supporters and the late equaliser he scored when the teams met in September 2014 added salt into the wounds – although he did refuse to celebrate.</p>
      <p>This Saturday Chelsea head back to the Etihad, and it is worth pondering the current thoughts of that Chelsea supporter who put up a now infamous, poorly judged banner which read “Lampard, you are not a legend anymore. You are a traitor to Chelsea FC and Chelsea fans” when the head coach was turning out in light blue.</p>
      <p>Excusing the fact that, <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/chelsea-bobby-tambling-frank-lampard-17091721">to again borrow a Tambling phrase,</a> Lampard is “probably Chelsea’s greatest player” can anyone debate his status as a club legend now?</p>
      <p>For a time it looked like Lampard would branch out into a world beyond football – the TV comedy panel show appearances, the children’s book series and, briefly, some punditry – but at Derby he said that he felt a “burning desire” to become a manager since his early 30s.</p>
      <p>Once he retired from playing, aged 38, he took a short break but the game came calling quickly. "I'm grateful to the Football Association for the opportunity to study for my coaching qualifications and I look forward to pursuing the off-field opportunities that this decision opens,” he said upon leaving New York, with a number of playing opportunities turned down.</p>
      <p>His appointment at Derby County came via a phone call between his uncle Harry Redknapp and owner Mel Morris but to suggest that he ended up in the job solely because of his connections would be false. Morris was instantly impressed by his vision.</p>
      <p>By making some shrewd decisions in the loan market – Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori from Chelsea, Harry Wilson from Liverpool – he turned an ageing team into one with a youthful zest and they duly ended up in the play-off final.</p>
      <p>There is also a temptation to put forward the theory that the familiarity of working with Tomori and Mount last season is benefiting Chelsea now. Perhaps but the development of Tammy Abraham and Reece James among others suggests that Lampard is simply good at nurturing young talent.</p>
      <p>Things could take a downward turn in the future – and across football managers and clubs so rarely part ways on good terms – but for now it is hard to find any negativity and there seems a genuine possibility that the player who defined Chelsea's start to the decade is ending it as the coach who could shape the next.</p>
      <p>That Lampard has ended up at Stamford Bridge so quickly is, unquestionably, the result of some good fortune. Much like his knack for arriving in the area at the right time, the timing was impeccable.</p>
      <p>If Chelsea were not facing a transfer ban, would they have sought a more established manager to replace the unpopular Maurizio Sarri? It is impossible to say. But the early evidence has merely solidified Lampard’s status as one of Chelsea’s greats – if not the greatest.</p>
