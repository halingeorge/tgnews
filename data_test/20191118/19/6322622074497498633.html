      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): The government agreed in principle to develop ‘Malaysia Street’ in conjunction with the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo next year, said Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Redzuan Yusof.</p>
      <p>He said it was to promote and market Malaysian halal products directly to 40 million visitors, including eight million Muslim visitors and locals.</p>
      <p>“The Japanese government will provide the site, it will be developed in partnership between the government and the entrepreneurs, we will be the facilitator.</p>
      <p>“For example, booths and halal kitchens will be provided so that visitors to the Games can enjoy Malaysian food and halal products,” he said when winding up the 2020 Supply Bill for his Ministry at the Dewan Rakyat today.</p>
      <p>He said the programme is expected to generate huge returns as the halal market in Japan is worth RM1.2 billion.</p>
      <p>He said the ministry had also appointed four leading companies to serve as anchors to market a wide range of halal products from Malaysia in conjunction with the Games.</p>
      <p>The Dewan Rakyat sitting continues on Tuesday. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
