      <p>MONTREAL — The City of Montreal is honouring a man hailed as a hero after he used his SUV to shield pedestrians from a speeding car.</p>
      <p>Mayor Valerie Plante praised Erick Marciano's act of courage today as she presented him with a certificate of honour and invited him to sign the city's Golden Book.</p>
      <p>Plante said Marciano showed "remarkable heroism" when he pulled his vehicle in front of a driver fleeing police at a busy intersection last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But the 48-year-old father of three said he was only doing his duty when he made the split-second decision to act.</p>
      <p>He said his mind flashed to stories of drivers mowing down pedestrians in Europe, and he didn't want that to happen in Montreal.</p>
      <p>Marciano managed to get out of his car just before the collision and wasn't hurt, but his SUV suffered serious damage in the crash with the suspect's vehicle.</p>
