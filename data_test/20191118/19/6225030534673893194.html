      <h1>Tuesday's Best Bet: Mess'n Around means business at Parx</h1>

      <p>Tuesday’s 8th race from Parx is a starter allowance event for fillies and mares dashing six furlongs on the main track (Post Time 3:34 p.m. ET).</p>

      <p>#4 MESS’N AROUND (3-1) is a consistent 4-year-old filly cutting back a furlong, and four of her six wins were at this distance. She projects a stalking trip.</p>
      <p>#7 Barley Jack (7-5) won her last three local sprints vs. PA-bred foes. The sharp mare owns early-pressing versatility.</p>
      <p>#6 Atina Salsa (6-1) is capable of winning this on her best day. The early-pressing filly has been a bit inconsistent in mostly longer races recently. She exits a disappointing try as the beaten favorite at this distance, but has won twice at six panels.</p>
      <p>#5 Special Risk (15-1) packs a decent late kick and might be able to rally for a share. She frequently finishes in the top three at this distance.</p>
