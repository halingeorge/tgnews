      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/molly-mae-hague/">Molly-Mae Hague</a> is giving us serious envy as posed in her underwear on a boat in Barbados.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> star, who is dating fellow contestant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tommy-fury/">Tommy Fury</a>, took part in a solo trip to the Caribbean island with fast fashion giant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/08/love-islands-molly-mae-hague-lands-times-square-billboard-thanks-500k-prettylittlething-deal-10707956/">Pretty Little Thing</a>, where she was treated to a day of luxury aboard a catamaran off the coast.</p>
      <p>Joined by a host of photographers, the 20-year-old wore her trademark long blonde hair in a lengthy fishtail braid (not a high bun in sight!) and later removed her bikini top in order to get a nice, even tan as she lounged around in the sun.</p>
      <p>Clutching a towel to her front to prevent things from getting a bit nippy, Molly-Mae showed off her incredible figure in white, thong style bikini bottoms.</p>
      <p>We’re not sure what we’re more jealous of: the bikini, the boat or the body.</p>

      <p>Changing out of her swimwear to get a second shot, the influencer donned an eeny weeny gold bikini with a triangle style top, wearing her hair in a high ponytail.</p>

      <p>We know it’s nearly Christmas, but can it please be summer already? Because these pictures are making us far too jealous.</p>
      <p>Having recently moved in with boyfriend Tommy to a flat in Manchester, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/molly-mae-hague-smug-relationship-tommy-fury-outlasted-love-island-couples-11067174/">Love Island runners up</a> couldn’t be happier together.</p>

      <p>In fact, Molly-Mae recently revealed that she suspected the relationship could move to the next step in the coming months, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/love-islands-molly-mae-hague-believes-tommy-fury-will-pop-the-question-over-new-year-11065958/">she thinks Tommy will propose</a> to her before the year is out.</p>
      <p>Yep, you heard that right.</p>

      <p>‘I wouldn’t be surprised if he did pop the question when we’re in the Maldives over New Year,’ she speculated.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t waste my time, I wouldn’t want to be in a relationship with someone thinking, “This is only short term.”</p>
      <p>‘I wasn’t thinking, “When’s the sell-by date on this one?” We’re going to be together forever.’</p>
