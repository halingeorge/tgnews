        <b>NHS England is set to outline a major policy change agreed with government which they hope will act as a short-term solution to the NHS pensions crisis.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>HSJ</i> understands the change could be outlined in a letter from NHSE chief executive Simon Stevens to the British Medical Association and medical royal colleges on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It follows major concern that senior doctors refusing to work additional hours – because of the fear of it sparking large pensions tax bills – is and will have a huge impact on safety and performance this winter.</p>
      <p>Sources involved in the deal said the new arrangement would involve medics able to tick the “[pension] scheme pays” choice on their tax return for this financial year – therefore have the tax bill which would have been due this year instead deducted from their pension fund. Under the new arrangement, the government would guarantee this money would be repaid to the fund when the medic retired.</p>
      <p>Ministers and government officials have been required to sanction the announcement of the scheme, even though they are normally banned from making major government policy changes and announcements during the pre-election “purdah” period.</p>
      <p>Officials have been exploring how they can make urgent interventions to improve the situation despite this constraint. And <i>HSJ</i><i> </i>understands the move will be presented as an NHSE “operational measure” rather than government policy.</p>
      <p>It is also being described as a “stopgap” for 2019-20 while the government discusses further changes to the tax regime for the longer term: These can only normally be made at a fiscal event like a government budget.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported in <i>The Times </i>this evening and <i>HSJ </i>understands no formal measures have yet been taken.</p>
      <p>The British Medical Association and Department of Health and Social Care have been approached for comment.</p>
      <p>The Treasury said it would make no comment and referred enquiries to the DHSC.</p>
      <p>The Royal College of Surgeons said it welcomed ”reports that a temporary solution had been found”.</p>
      <p>Derek Alderson, RCS president, said: ”Abolishing the NHS pensions tax trap was one of the headlines of our <a href="https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/about-the-rcs/about-our-mission/our-manifesto-for-surgery/">’Manifesto for Surgery</a>’ that we published last week. We hope that all the political parties will now get behind this and find a permanent solution.</p>
      <p>“As winter approaches, it is crucial that the NHS can operate at full capacity and that consultant surgeons and hospital doctors are not penalised for working extra hours.”</p>
      <p><i>HSJ </i>has reported on the extensive disruption which has gathered pace since new pensions rules were introduced in 2016, made more acute as the service moves into winter.</p>
      <p>On Monday morning an <i>HSJ </i>editorial <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/comment/what-if-the-doctors-never-come-back/7026387.article">warned of serious long as well as short consequences,</a> with doctors realising they did not need or want to work as long hours as they have done. </p>
      <p>NHS representative bodies have previously complained that solutions offered so far have not covered professions other than doctors, including senior managers, who are also affected by the tax rule change. </p>
