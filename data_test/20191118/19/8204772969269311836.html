      </p>
      <p>Stephen Kenny’s ploy in this European Championship campaign of gaining a headstart on his under-21 rivals by packing 70 per cent of the Republic of Ireland’s qualifiers into eight months will get a proper assessment after this meeting with <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Sweden">Sweden</a>.</p>
      <p>The incoming manager of the under-21s, mindful of his need to depart for the senior job as soon as possible after Euro 2020, got his wish at the draw in December of frontloading his fixtures.</p>
      <p>Bottom seeds in the group to qualify for the 2021 finals, Luxembourg were easily accounted for 3-0 back in March, an isolated fixture ahead of three double-headers later in the year.</p>
      <p>Three further wins were accrued in those five matches, along with a draw against top seeds Italy and their sole defeat of the campaign in Iceland.</p>
      <p>Ten points from 15 keep <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> top of the table, but with seven of the 16 matches by Tuesday night having featured Kenny’s team, the room for error is receding.</p>
      <p>Kenny will have two more competitive games left, at home to Iceland and away to Luxembourg, before a successor will take the final outing in Italy next September.</p>
      <p>In a campaign where second place will clinch a play-off for the finals, beating the second seeds Swedes 3-1 eight weeks ago was their most impressive of the results to date.</p>
      <p>Italy, despite Ireland holding them scoreless last month, are fully expected to claim the one automatic place on offer into the finals, to be jointly hosted by Hungary and Slovenia.</p>
      <p>Kenny will be without <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Aaron+Connolly">Aaron Connolly</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jonathan+Afolabi">Jonathan Afolabi</a> from that victory in Kalmar, Sweden, while the availability of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Troy+Parrott">Troy Parrott</a> is dependent on his involvement in the senior game against Denmark.</p>
      <p>For Sweden, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mattias+Svanberg">Mattias Svanberg</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Dejan+Kulusevski">Dejan Kulusevski</a> were involved with the senior squad in the Euro qualifier against Faroe Islands.</p>
      <p>“To be up there at the top of the table on 16 looking down on the other teams will be scary for them,” said <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Nathan+Collins">Nathan Collins</a>, the teen defender in line to win his second cap.</p>
      <p>“Becoming the first to reach an under-21 finals is a big thing we’re striving for. If will be historic. We know we’ve players in the squad capable of achieving that.”</p>
