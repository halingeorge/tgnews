      <h2>There will be at least one class per month, says GVMC Commissioner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:55:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Harish-Gilai-25437/" target="_blank">Harish Gilai</a></address>
      <p>The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has decided to launch orientation classes on home composting and segregation of waste at source in municipal schools.</p>
      <p>“There will be at least one class per month on segregation of dry, wet waste and hazardous waste at source and home composting. The orientation classes aims at providing students a hands-on approach towards the issue. Awareness on waste management in the tender will help children do their bit towards protection of environment and reduction of waste,” says Municipal Commissioner G. Srijana.</p>
      <p>According to J.V. Ratnam of Green Climate, an NGO, children need to be sensitised to home composting, source segregation and other eco-friendly techniques, given the growing pollution levels.</p>
      <p>“Many people still dump or burn garbage, contributing substantially to environment pollution. The Swachh Bharat guidelines also stress reduction of waste. Introducing such techniques in school is a good move,” he opines.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ratnam also says that they have started home composting classes in a few schools in the city earlier and a school in Bhimili has done well in this regard.</p>
      <p>Around 30,000 students are studying in 147 schools including 116 primary schools, 27 high schools under the purview of the GVMC.</p>
      <p>The GVMC is giving a top priority to waste management techniques and is planning to ensure that waste is being reduced right at the source.</p>
      <h3>SHG women sensitised</h3>
      <p>The Urban Community Development (UCD) wing of the civic body is planning to create awareness among homemakers on waste management such as segregation of waste, home composting and house farming. A drive involving a large number of women working in SHGs associated with the GVMC is also being undertaken. The women are being sensitised to home composting.</p>
      <p>“Home composting is a growing trend in the urban area these days. You grow vegetables in your home. This is for our health and we have been creating awareness over this,” Ms. Srijana adds.</p>
