      <p><i>Chup!</i> Before any of ya’ll getting triggered by this video, let’s just remind ourselves that everyone has their own preferences when it comes to love. <i>Although we think it would be really hard for this girl to find a decent one with her high demands.</i></p>
      <p>Recently on Twitter, a user that goes by the name <a href="https://twitter.com/yourstrulydonnv">@yourstrulydonnv</a> posted a video of an Instagram beauty guru’s story that has caused all kinds of fuss since it went up. In it, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/darlingsara_/">@darlingsara_</a> explained how much she detests dating Malay guys because they would normally end up hanging out at mamak restaurants.</p>

      <p>As you can hear in the video, for a girl of her standard, it should always be <b>fine dining</b>. Not to mention, her partner should be able to afford to shower her with gifts and flowers every so often and put up with her spoiled attitude. <b>She wants to be pampered</b>. <i>And OBVIOUSLY Malay guys can’t provide any of this.</i></p>
      <p>As usual, netizens responded differently to this post and <i>lemme tell you, it ain’t all pretty.</i></p>
      <p>“What you’re looking for here is a sugar daddy.”</p>

      <p>“Now this is a high maintenance lady, she’s crazy.”</p>

      <p>“Or she could have just said, “I love rich guys.” Simpler and easier to explain.”</p>

      <p>“Do you think your life is a Malay drama?”</p>

      <p>But again, this is her preference and every girl should have the freedom to decide how she wants to be valued.</p>
      <p>“Everyone has their own preferences. It’s not a problem if you want to date Malay, Chinese, Indian or Mat Salleh even.”</p>

      <p>“She works hard to get loads of money, so it’s really her choice on what kind of men she prefers. It’s up to her to like or dislike anything. A lot of people are giving a lot of spite in the comment section.”</p>

      <p>“At least this girl is honest. She straight away clarified her preferences. Didn’t even try to cover things up. May she find someone compatible.”</p>

        <i>Either way, we are definitely triggered that mamak restaurants are shunned. Mamak is a fine dinner on its own okay. *sobs sobs</i>
