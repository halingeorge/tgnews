      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/delaware-pleads-guilty-killing-drug-high-tv-show">Police in Delaware</a> released facial reconstruction images Monday in the hope of identifying a young girl whose remains were found <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/cold-case">last month</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/delaware-state-investigating-alleged-hazing-after-4-students-injured-in-crash-school-officials-say">Smyrna</a> Police Department says the girl was between the ages of 2 and 5, had wavy brown hair, and was Caucasian or Hispanic. She was found in September next to the Little Lass softball fields.</p>
      <p>"Somebody [was] down there, visiting the park, it's open to the public, they had their dog with them. Dog wanders off, comes back with what looked like a bone fragment," Smyrna Police Cpl. Brian Donner told <a href="https://www.wdel.com/news/with-facial-reconstruction-smyrna-police-hope-they-know-what-a/article_ef51742e-0a2b-11ea-967d-977c71230fdd.html">News Radio WDEL</a>. "At which point, that person notified the police."</p>

      <p>Donner said investigators were analyzing evidence found at the scene to determine if the body had been set on fire, according to the station.</p>
      <p>Investigators haven’t said how the child died, but believe the girl died weeks before the remains were found, if not longer.</p>
      <p>“An anthropological exam of her remains suggests that she suffered from chronic illness,” the department added in a news release.</p>

      <p>Forensic artists with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children came up with the digital reconstruction.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook post, Smyrna police said the case had no connection to the Dulce Marie Alavez missing child case in southern New Jersey.</p>

      <p>“Their child [Alavez] went missing [three] days after we discovered the remains of ours,” the post said. “These children, while resembling one another, are conclusively separate."</p>
      <p>Dulce, 5, hasn't been seen since disappearing from a park in Bridgeton, possibly in an abduction, police said.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the Delaware case should contact detective Bill Davis at 302-653-3490.</p>
