      <h1>Maharashtra impasse: Post split, Shiv Sena joins forces with Opposition</h1>
      <h2>Party signs notice moved by Trinamool seeking discussion on economic crisis</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:45:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sobhana-K-Nair-11583/" target="_blank">Sobhana K. Nair</a></address>
      <p>Sanjay Raut, Rajya Sabha member of the Shiv Sena, on Monday, signed a notice moved by the Trinamool to initiate a short duration discussion on “the grave economic crisis in India and how to improve the situation” in the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>This comes days after the Sena walked out of the ruling National Democratic Alliance over sharing of power in Maharashtra. The Sena’s three MPs have been shifted to the Opposition benches. In keeping with the alliance talks with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Mr. Raut was seated next to the NCP’s Majeed Memon.</p>
      <p>Other signatories to the notice include the Dravida Munnetra Kazgham, Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party, CPI (Marxist), CPI, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, and the NCP. The Congress has submitted a separate notice on similar lines.</p>
      <p>The Opposition had demanded a discussion on the state of the economy during the all-party meeting on Sunday where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given an assurance that the government was prepared to hold discussions on any topic proposed by the Opposition.</p>
      <p>“We will be taking up the fact that the GDP is on a decline and to hide it all, the government has been suppressing data,” said a senior Opposition leader, declining to be identified. “Apart from this, the government is doing large scale disinvestment of PSUs and Air India which is as good as selling the family jewels,” he asserted.</p>
      <p>The Congress had called for a meeting of the Opposition for 12:30 p.m. on Monday. The meeting, however, was cancelled at the last minute as the Lok Sabha was not adjourned in time. The Sena is likely to be invited for the rescheduled meeting.</p>
      <p>CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury asserted that India’s economy had entered a recession.</p>
      <p>“As per the international standards if the GDP falls continuously for two quarters then it’s officially considered as recession. India’s data credibility is the lowest in the world, which is why our global ratings are also being downgraded,” Mr. Yechury contended.</p>
      <p>The business advisory meeting for the Rajya Sabha indicated that the government has, as of now, not listed the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.</p>
      <p>Over the next few sessions, the upper house will see two ordinances being introduced: one on banning e-cigarettes and another on amendments to taxation laws. The surrogacy bill that bans any commercial surrogacy will also be tabled in the Rajya Sabha.</p>
