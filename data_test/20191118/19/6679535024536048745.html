      <p>The Delhi High Court on Monday declined to entertain a plea by two lawyers seeking to replace the police with some other security force in the courts here in view of the clash between the two sides earlier this month.</p>
      <p>A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar refused to hear the matter saying that the situation between lawyers and the police needs to be settled and such petitions would not help.</p>
      <p>It also said that the Centre, represented by its standing counsel Anil Soni, may consider providing additional training to police, if it was required.</p>
      <p>Reepak Kansal and Yadunandan Bansal had claimed in their petition that since the November 2 clash between lawyers and police, advocates feared for their life as the policemen had fired upon them and also destroyed property at the Tis Hazari Court Complex.</p>
      <p>Since the clash, the High Court has issued orders preventing coercive action against lawyers and police personnel in connection with FIRs lodged regarding the clash in which over 20 policemen and eight lawyers were injured.</p>
