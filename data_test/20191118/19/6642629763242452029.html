      <p><b>Glasgow, United Kingdom - </b>Britain's Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP) have failed in their legal bid to be included in a televised debate before the UK general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>The ITV channel is scheduled to broadcast a debate between Conservative leader, and current prime minister, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a>, and the Labour Party's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/jeremy-corbyn.html">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, on Tuesday. But judges at the High Court in London threw out arguments made by the Lib Dems and the pro-independence SNP, which both asserted that their political convictions also required the same airtime as their rivals.</p>
      <p>The two judges said ITV was not carrying out a "public function" in law by hosting the debate and stated there was "no arguable breach of the Broadcasting Code".</p>

      <p>"ITV's decision to host a Johnson-Corbyn head-to-head fails to account for the shape of the political landscape in the UK today," Alasdair Pinkerton, a Lib Dem parliamentary candidate, told Al Jazeera. "This is deeply retrograde and saddening. The British public deserve better. ITV is reinforcing a two-party binary that no longer exists in the UK."</p>
      <p>Following the 2016 UK-wide in/out European Union referendum - which saw a slender majority of Britons vote to depart the European bloc - the Lib Dems and the SNP, both unashamedly pro-EU, have looked to appeal to voters who are hostile towards the UK's forthcoming EU withdrawal, with the SNP also looking to court Scots who back a second vote on Scottish independence.</p>
      <p>But, despite the defeat for both parties, one political observer contended that just "bringing the case is [making] a point in itself".</p>
      <p>"It highlights the struggle and failure of the UK- and London-based media to understand the four nations [of Britain]," renowned Scottish political commentator Gerry Hassan told Al Jazeera. "So, it doesn't do them any harm in bringing this and then losing."</p>
      <h3>The 2010 game-changer</h3>
      <p>Controversy over TV debates has plagued British general elections since the first televised contest between party leaders was held in 2010. A TV debate was not even a real proposition until 1997 when an electoral clash between Conservative prime minister John Major and Labour Party leader Tony Blair appeared on the cards. But discussions broke down without agreement - and Blair went on to crush his rival by securing a landslide parliamentary majority.</p>
      <p>Thirteen years later, however, and Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, party leaders of Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats respectively, reached a consensus to hold three head-to-head televised debates with broadcasters, ushering in a British electoral first.</p>
      <p>The results were immediate. The first debate on April 15, 2010, recast Clegg from also-ran to apparent contender as plaudits for his performance poured in from all sides. His party's poll ratings surged and "Cleggmania" appeared to sweep the nation.</p>
      <p>While the general election result for the Lib Dems was a letdown, Clegg soon became deputy prime minister to David Cameron in a Conservative-Liberal coalition government that lasted until 2015.</p>
      <p>The UK's changing political landscape experienced a dramatic shift that year when the pro-independence SNP - the party of government at the Scottish Parliament since 2007 - swept the board in Scotland, rocketing from just six Westminster MPs to holding 56 out of 59 Scottish constituencies.</p>
      <p>Building on support from the 45 percent of Scots who voted for statehood in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the SNP surpassed the Liberal Democrats to become the third-largest party at Westminster - a position where, despite losing seats in the 2017 general election, the party remains.</p>
      <p>Yet, today, both the Lib Dems and the SNP will have to content themselves with debates that will include their party leaders, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon respectively, on the BBC alone.</p>
      <p>But while Tuesday's head-to-head debate will see Johnson and Corbyn square-off in a political duel that will draw in millions of viewers, Pinkerton, who is fighting for an English constituency, remains unamused.</p>
      <p>"While this may provide the kind of masculine aesthetic and straightforwardly confrontational format that excites a broadcaster, I'm not convinced the public will find the occasion quite so appealing," he said.</p>
