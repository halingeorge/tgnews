      <h1>Seek legal clarification onSabarimala decision: CPI</h1>

      <p>The State executive of the Communist Party of India (CPI) has urged the government to seek a clarification on the November 14 Supreme Court decision referring to a seven-judge Bench a batch of petitions seeking a review of its earlier decision to allow entry of women of all age groups to the Sabarimala temple.</p>
      <p>The executive that met here on Monday said that the Constitution is supreme and the government is bound to function as per its tenets. The legal system has the onus to scrutinise whether the government is implementing its decisions. The Supreme Court is bound to ensure the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court verdict on September 28, 2018 granting unrestricted rights for women to enter the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple was one that upheld the spirit of the Constitution. As per Article 141 of the Constitution, Supreme Court verdicts are applicable all over the country and this has been pointed out by Justice Rohinton Nariman, the executive said.</p>
      <h3>Clear confusion</h3>
      <p>The latest apex court decision on the review petitions has caused confusion even in legal circles. The State government should expedite steps to clear the confusion through established means, it said.</p>
      <p>P.P.Suneer presided. State secretary Kanam Raendran and other leaders also attended the meeting.</p>
