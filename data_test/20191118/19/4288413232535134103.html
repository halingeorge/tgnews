      <h1>Meyer Optik is Back: New Trioplan 100 f/2.8 II Coming This Month, More to Follow</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.meyer-optik-goerlitz.com/">Meyer Optik Görlitz</a> is coming back from the dead… again. After an <a href="https://petapixel.com/2018/08/21/how-meyer-optik-gorlitz-won-at-kickstarter-but-failed-at-life/">embarrassing and very public fall-from grace</a> in 2018, the lens manufacturer, now owned by OPC Optics, is ready to begin re-releasing lenses that it promises are not <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/03/07/meyer-optik-gorlitz-admits-nocturnus-was-a-modified-chinese-lens/">just re-branded Chinese knockoffs</a> at astronomic markups.</p>
      <p>The company first announced its planned renaissance in July, when OPC Optics revealed that Meyer Optik was on schedule to begin re-releasing “optimized” Version II models of the Trioplan 100, Trioplan 50, Lydith 30, Primoplan 75, Primoplan 58, and Trioplan 35+ by “end of summer.”</p>
      <p>They’ve missed that deadline by a few weeks, but <a href="https://www.meyer-optik-goerlitz.com/en/lenses/">a new announcement on the company’s website</a> states that the first optimized lens—the Trioplan 100mm f/2.8 II—will be ready to make its debut at the “end of November,” with more lenses to follow “in monthly intervals.” You can sign up on to be notified when the lenses are officially available, and Meyer Optik will throw in a 10% coupon for your troubles.</p>

      <p>According to the website, the first three lenses you can expect in the coming months are the Trioplan 100mm f/2.8 II for 1,000 Euro (~$1,100), the Lydith 30mm f/3.5 II for 900 Euro (~$1,000) and the Trioplan 50mm f/2.9 II for 900 Euro (~$1,000). Eventually, the company also plans to release a brand-new Primagon 50mm f/2.0 created entirely under the OPC Optics umbrella, but we don’t expect that lens to arrive until 2020 if it arrives at all.</p>
