      <p>A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed at Bombay High Court seeking a ban on TikTok because it claims that the app is “causing hatred, disbalance and enmity among religious groups and has affected the country’s diversity”.</p>
      <p>The PIL filed by Heena Darvesh, a mother of three, states, “TikTok is being used as a medium of unfiltered sexual content, and harming youths of the country. The app is affecting young people, especially children, by causing addiction issues leading to degraded mental health.”</p>
      <p>The plea, filed on November 11, mentions that the Chinese mobile application made by Bytedance (India) Technology Private Limited used to upload videos is “defaming the country and tarnishing the PM’s image.” The application urges the high court to direct the government to provide records of deaths due to accidents caused by use of TikTok.</p>
      <p>The PIL says, “TikTok has resulted in several criminal incidents, including deaths in some instances,” and refers to a similar petition to ban the app filed before the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court.</p>
      <p>In April 2019, the Madurai court had passed an order directing the Tamil Nadu government to ban the app. However, Bytedance moved the Supreme Court against it. The apex court refused to stay the order and directed Madurai bench to decide the matter. It then lifted the ban.</p>
      <p>The matter is likely to be heard before by Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla on Tuesday.</p>
