      <h1>England head coach Eddie Jones admits regret over calling Wales a 'little s**t place'</h1>
      <h2>The outspoken England coach had made his barbed comment at an event in Japan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:11:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:11</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Howell</a></address>
      <p>Eddie Jones has opened up the about the two major off-field blunders he's made since being England coach.</p>
      <p>And they concern Wales and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/warren-gatland">Warren Gatland</a> with Jones admitting his own goals proved costly.</p>
      <p>The first came when a video was leaked of the outspoken Australia bad-mouthing Wales and Ireland at a corporate event in Japan.</p>
      <p>It came on the eve of England's failed attempt to deny Ireland a Grand Slam in the 2018 <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/six-nations">Six Nations.</a></p>
      <p>"In my attempt to muse the Japanese audience I referred to the 'scummy Irish' and Wales as a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/england-head-coach-eddie-jones-14412672">'little s**t place'</a> ," wrote Jones in his new autobiography My Life And Rugby.</p>
      <p>"I was embarrassed. Not only because the slurs weren't funny but because they weren't my real views.</p>
      <p>"I was going for a cheap laugh. While it was clear in the video I was smiling and joking, it looked bad. It was bad."</p>

      <p>Jones' second mistake was a howler which he feels may have cost any chance of beating Gatland to the job of Lions head honcho for the cream of British and Irish rugby's 2021 three-Test series with new world champions South Africa.</p>
      <p>"I have for a long time wanted to coach the Lions. I'd kept it a secret that I had set my sights on the 2021 tour of South Africa," wrote Jones, who steered England to this month's Rugby World Cup final.</p>
      <p>But he made a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/eddie-jones-disparaging-response-asked-16027204">public gaffe when interviewed</a> by a journalist from Brisbane, Australia.</p>
      <p>"I tried to have a laugh with him and said coaching the Lions was an ambassador job. 'The last thing I want to do is spend eight weeks in a blazer'," recalled Jones.</p>
      <p>"'I'm a coach. I'd rather coach the Queensland Sheffield Shield [cricket] team'.</p>
      <p>"Again, it was a terrible lapse of judgement. To this day, I don't know why I said it."</p>
      <p>Jones lost out to Gatland when the appointment was made but still hopes one day to lead the Lions, saying it would be an "honour and a privilege."</p>
