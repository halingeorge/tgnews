      <h1>Woman languishing in Assam detention centre since 2010</h1>
      <h2>Wrong details received twice have delayed her release</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:53:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Rahul-Karmakar-16396/" target="_blank">Rahul Karmakar</a></address>
      <p>Wrong details received twice by the authorities have delayed the release of a woman lodged in one of Assam’s six detention camps for foreigners since 2010.</p>
      <p>Mamiran Nessa, lodged in western Assam’s Kokrajhar detention centre, should have been set free following the Supreme Court’s order in May to conditionally release all declared foreigners who have completed three or more years in detention.</p>
      <p>But officers of the Assam Police Border Organisation – it has been tasked with detecting and deporting foreigners or illegal immigrants since 1962 – said she could not be released as they “twice received details wrongly”.</p>
      <p>In July, the State government informed the Assembly that 335 out of the 1,145 declared foreigners across the six detention centres had spent three years or more in captivity. About a dozen had by then been released.</p>
      <p>More than 25 declared foreigners have been released and another 56 are to be released soon. Ms. Nessa is not among them.</p>
      <p>“Her case is in process. Police are hand-holding to submit the correct information,” Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, Special Director General of Police (Border), told <i>The Hindu</i> via message.</p>
      <h3>Formalities fulfilled</h3>
      <p>Guwahati-based lawyer Aman Wadud, who fights cases of poor declared foreigners <i>pro bono</i>, said all formalities according to the Supreme Court’s guidelines have been fulfilled in Ms. Nessa’s case. The formalities include two sureties of ₹1 lakh each and collection of biometric information.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, a team that included activist Harsh Mander, SC lawyer Prashant Bhushan and Mr. Wadud visited Ms. Nessa’s paternal home near Abhayapuri in Bongaigaon district.</p>
      <p>“When she was detained, her sons were 2 and 9 years old. Both brothers were brought up by their elder sister who was still a minor. She dropped out of school and worked as maid to raise them at their maternal uncle’s place,” Mr. Wadud said.</p>
      <p>Ms. Nessa was married in the 1990s to Jel Hussain of village Takakata near Baghbor in western Assam’s Barpeta district. Her family said she was randomly marked a doubtful voter in 1997 without any investigation.</p>
      <p>“She was subsequently declared a foreigner without any competent legal representation,” Mr. Wadud said.</p>
      <p>Ms. Nessa’s parents took her children home after her husband fell ill and was mostly confined to the bed. He could visit her in the detention centre only once in nine years. Mr. Hussain died two months ago due to cardiac arrest. Members of his family said his last wish was to see his wife out of jail and beside him.</p>
      <p>Ms. Nessa has not been told about her husband’s death yet.</p>
