      <p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got a rare night out together without their three children.</p>
      <p>The couple were the guests of honour at The Royal Variety Performance held at the London Palladium which supports entertainers as they get older or in hard times.</p>
      <p>With Queen Elizabeth as patron, each year a different representative from the Royal Family shows up for the big night which is always good for a laugh. This is the third time the couple has attending and in the past, Prince William was prompted to gallop around like a horse.</p>

      <p>William and Kate took time to meet with the entertainers who put on the show, including singer Petula Clark who chatted with the Duchess about her three children Prince George, 6, Princess Charlotte, 4, and Prince Louis, 1.</p>
      <p>According to<a href="https://ca.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019111880760/kate-middleton-prince-william-talk-children-joke-about-date-night/"><i> Hello!</i> </a>Kate told Clark that the kids were very excited that their parents were going to a night filled with singing and dancing. And while they would “love” to go, the Duchess had to tell them “not on a school night.”</p>

      <p>Comedians Rob Beckett and Ramesh Ranganathan also spoke with William about the children, revealing they have three kids as well. They assumed that Will and Kate have the same thought when their kids wake them up early in the morning- “Why did we do this?”</p>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess didn’t reply but did laugh at the thought.</p>
