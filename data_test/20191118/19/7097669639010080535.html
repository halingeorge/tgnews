      <h1>Straight pride event attracts just three people</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:35:57+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zoe Tidman</a></address>
      <p>A “<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/straight-pride">straight pride</a>“ event gathered just three supporters in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dallas">Dallas</a>, who waved their flag and argued with counter-protesters nevertheless.</p>
      <p>Two members of Super Happy Fun America (SHFA), a group advocating for “straight rights”, turned up to protest after claiming the original event had been postponed in a series of Facebook videos.</p>
      <p>The men were seen confronting counter-protesters carrying transgender pride flags who approached them.</p>
      <p>“Are you a heterophobe?” one asked while filming a video later posted on SHFA’s Facebook page.</p>
      <p>The other claimed he had been sacked from his job “for being straight”.</p>
      <p>SHFA said a planned larger rally fell through after its organisers, Protecting our Next Generations, were “unfairly treated” by Dallas city officials who asked them to pay thousands of dollars for a permit, which would cover security costs.</p>
      <p>The two men said they decided to turn up anyway to “express freedom of speech”.</p>
      <p>“I knew that attendance would be low, but I couldn’t stop laughing when I saw that it was just them,” activist Soraya Colli told the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lgbtq">LGBTQ</a> magazine <i>Advocate.</i></p>
      <p>Ms Colli said the pair were later joined by another supporter and a woman who later “rebuked” them.</p>
      <p>“They really believe anti-fascists are out there throwing bricks and beating up Trump supporters,” Ms Colli said, “but instead it was LGBT allies with rubber chickens and cowbells to drown them out.”</p>
      <p>SHFA ran a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/straight-pride-parade-application-proposal-boston-city-super-happy-fun-america-a8978611.html">“straight pride” parade in Boston</a> over summer which was also outnumbered by counter-protesters who turned up, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/01/boston-straight-pride-parade-arrests"><i>The Guardian</i></a>.</p>
