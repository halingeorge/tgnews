      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has postponed his proposed visit to Ayodhya on November 24 in view of security reasons and the delay in government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>After the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya last week. Mr. Thackeray had announced that he would visit Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>“However, security in Ayodhya is still heightened and political parties are not being allowed to visit. Besides, there is no breakthrough on talks over government formation in the State,” said a Sena leader.</p>
