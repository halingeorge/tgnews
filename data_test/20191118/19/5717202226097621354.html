      <h1>Tim Sherwood questions Gareth Southgate over continued Jack Grealish absence</h1>

      <p>Former Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood believes England boss Gareth Southgate is missing a trick not picking Jack Grealish.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions boss upset a section of the Villa faithful once again by ignoring their captain for the latest Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo, despite a brilliant run of games that saw him nominated for Premier League Player of the Month.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has seemingly been knocking at the door, but Southgate has so far resisted temptation, and Sherwood cannot comprehend it.</p>

      <p>The 50-year-old, who worked with Grealish for eight months at Villa Park, <a href="https://talksport.com/football/631354/aston-villa-jack-grealish-england-tim-sherwood/">said on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show</a>: “For me, England have missed the boat with Jack Grealish.</p>
      <p>“This kid is something different, the ball is his friend – 100 percent they missed the boat on him.</p>
      <p>“This kid is special. He creates a mêlée around him, he sees the pass and realises it at the right time.</p>
      <p>“Yes, he’s got to add more goals to his game, he won’t ever score as many goals as Mason Mount will, but what he does is he realises players with freedom because he creates such a crowd around him.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Pressure on for Grealish</h3>
      <p>With England’s Euro 2020 qualifying campaign now done and dusted, there are only two more friendly matches to go before next summer’s finals.</p>

      <p>The pressure will definitely be on for Grealish now given the few international chances in the offing.</p>
      <p>The odds of him getting a seat on the plane are probably against him at this point, especially given the wealth of midfield options available to Southgate.</p>
      <p>All he can do is give his all, and perhaps the manager will throw the currently uncapped star an opportunity next March.</p>
