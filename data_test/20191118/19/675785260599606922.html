      <h2>The Drag Race star was emotional while admitting she wanted to make a powerful statement that 'love is greater than hate' with her final ever Strictly Come Dancing routine</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:13:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">Kyle O'Sullivan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kyle-osullivan/</a></address>
      <p>Michelle Visage started 'choking up' in tears on tonight's It Takes Two while defending her tribute to the LGBT+ community.</p>
      <p>The Drag Race star, 51, was the shock eight celebrity to leave <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> this weekend after her street commercial routine to Madonna's iconic hit Vogue.</p>
      <p>Michelle said she "went out in a blaze of gay glory" and her dance with pro partner Giovanni Pernice was a "love letter to my lovely LGBT+ community".</p>
      <p>Presenter Rylan Clark Neal asked Michelle how she felt about claims it was not a dance online before showing her some support from a fan.</p>
      <p>"That chokes me up," confessed emotional Michelle while Rylan passed her some tissues.</p>

      <p>She admitted: "This was not about a dance. It was about a statement. Love is greater than hate. So much more than just a dance. It was beautiful.</p>
      <p>"It meant so much to do this on a platform. Shine light on people who never get the attention they deserve and do it with class, sass and a fierceness."</p>
      <p>"Some things are more important than the winning. You can’t move mountains by sitting back. Voices are being heard."</p>
      <p>Turning to Giovanni, she added: "I want to say my partner has been by me all the way through this there by my side.</p>

      <p>Giovanni admitted that they both knew the street commercial dance was a risk and could see them go home.</p>
      <p>He said: "Both us said it's a risk. its not a style you see often in Strictly Come Dancing. We knew for a fact if we are in the dance-off with any other people we’d go home as it's different.</p>
      <p>"It is a style, a different style of dance. We wanted to send a message and were sure this message arrived everywhere. We were happy to go out sending a message to everybody and we were proud of it."</p>

      <p>Michelle and Giovanni were booted out of the competition after all the judges chose to save YouTuber Saffron Barker and her partner AJ Pritchard.</p>
      <p>She branded her experience "amazing" and admitted that she couldn't have done the show without her professional partner Giovanni.</p>
      <p>Michelle said: "At 51 years old and never danced in my life, I never thought I’d be able to do what I have done and to have such an incredible partner.</p>

      <p>"To be here for my husband and my kids and the entire community, that’s why I did what I did. I am so honoured to be welcomed by my new friends here.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about Giovanni, she added: "Obviously I couldn’t have done it without him. He has been so amazing, so transformative. Just my rock and my best friend throughout this entire competition.</p>
      <p>"He could take it as much as he could dish it, and I needed somebody like that. I’m going to miss seeing him every day. I would never have wanted to do this with anyone else."</p>

      <p>Praising his partner, Giovanni said: "You are wonderful. We laugh, we cry, we fight and we argue and we’v e done everything but I’ve loved every single second.</p>
      <p>"I think you are inspirational and we did this dance and wanted to send a message.</p>
      <p>"You are a phenomenal lady and I am so proud of everything we’ve done. I’m here to say thank you, thank you, thank you."</p>
