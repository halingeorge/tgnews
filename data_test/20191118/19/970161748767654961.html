      <p>Tamzin has now departed the soap <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/why-is-tamzin-outhwaite-leaving-eastenders-how-long-was-mel-in-the-soap-for-11126788/">after over two decades of playing Mel</a>, with viewers sad to see the door closed on the Walford legend for good.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter to thank her fans for all of their compliments and messages of support Tamzin wrote: ‘Thank you so much for all the love…I could not have relished playing Mel any more and I could not feel more proud. Here’s to the next 21 years of life, the next job, the next chapter.’</p>
      <p>So, if you missed Tamzin’s dramatic final scenes, here’s how Mel was killed off in EastEnders last week.</p>

      <p>Despite their rivalry and the fact that Mel had been blackmailing Sharon for weeks, the pregnant club owner helped free Mel from the wreckage, which caught fire while the women staggered to the side of the road.</p>

      <p>Sitting at the side of the road in shock, Mel asked Sharon why she saved her, claiming that she could hear her dead son’s voice and that he had been with her while she was trapped in the crushed car.</p>
      <p>‘You’re a liar,’ Mel declared as Sharon insisted there had been no one else in the car with her, before Mel staggered back towards the burning wreckage of her car.</p>
      <p>As Mel stepped back onto the highway, she was hit and killed by an oncoming lorry as a horrified Sharon watched.</p>
