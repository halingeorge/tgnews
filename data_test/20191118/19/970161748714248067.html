      <p>A pedophile father who admitted forcing his underage adopted daughters to have sex with him has been spared jail.</p>
      <p>Steven Wells, 49, was handed a six year suspended sentence and four years probation at Allen County Superior Court in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on Friday.</p>
      <p>Wells avoided custody thanks to a plea deal which saw him admit sexual misconduct for a minor, with more serious child molestation charges dropped in return.</p>
      <p>His victims were aged 14 and 13 at the time of the abuse, which started in 2012 and continued at the family home on a leafy Fort Wayne street for five years.</p>
      <p>Wells’ younger daughter has a disability which means she has the mental capacity of a seven year-old child.</p>

      <p>Their ordeal finally ended in 2016 when the older daughter opened up about the abuse to a counselor at a local Youth Opportunity Center.</p>

      <p>In a statement seen by <a href="https://www.wane.com/top-stories/man-admits-to-sex-with-adopted-daughters-gets-probation/">WANE</a>, she added: ‘I was going to hide it for my whole life and say nothing because I don’t want to see my dad go to prison.</p>
      <p>‘I told today because I am at my breaking point.’</p>
      <p>The victim has not shared her thoughts on Wells’ light sentence.</p>
      <p>Wells has been barred from contacting either of his victims, and was allowed to go free at the end of his court hearing on Friday.</p>
