      <h1>Top tip for making mouldy shower tiles look good as new - without scrubbing</h1>
      <h2>It's incredibly simple - and effective</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:49:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>It's no secret that mould thrives in bathrooms as the warm, damp conditions offer the perfect breeding conditions for the slime.</p>
      <p>Trying to get rid of it from tiles can be incredibly tricky, but one woman claims to have found a solution, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/womans-tip-making-mouldy-shower-20875722">Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>In a post on a cleaning tips and tricks <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group, an unnamed woman revealed she'd found a simple hack for removing mould without doing intense scrubbing - and it only cost around £2.</p>

      <p>The woman initially posted a photo of her mouldy grout on the group, asking fellow members for suggestions on how to get them looking new.</p>
      <p>Many people responded, sharing ideas including using toilet bowl cleaner and just re-sealing the tiles.</p>
      <p>After trying a few of the hacks, she finally found one that really did the trick, and all she needed was cotton wool and bleach.</p>
      <p>The woman claims she soaked pieces of cotton wool in the cleaning product and packed them all around the edges of the tiles.</p>
      <p>She left it on the tiles overnight and by the morning, the difference was incredible.</p>

      <p>She re-shared her original photo as well as a new one showing the results of the cleaning trick.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to everyone who has commented," she said.</p>
