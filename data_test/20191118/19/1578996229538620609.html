      <p>Kate Middleton dressed up tonight for her first of two evening events tonight: the 2019 Royal Variety Performance at the Palladium Theatre. The Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in a regal black lace gown. She wore her hair down. Prince William joined her in a sharp suit.</p>
      <p>The annual event benefits the Royal Variety Charity. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last attended the performance in 2017. Then, she wore a very glitzy, <i>Frozen </i>Elsa-like dress alongside her husband:</p>

      <p>William and Kate will be out again on Thursday for the Tusk Awards.</p>
      <p>Their events come at what appears to be the start of William's brother Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's extended break. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are taking extended time off this holiday, <i><a href="https://www.etonline.com/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-are-looking-to-recharge-their-batteries-with-upcoming-break-136534">Entertainment Tonight</a> </i>reported. A source told the outlet that the two are excited to "recharge their batteries." <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019111880728/prince-harry-meghan-markle-last-public-engagements-before-break/">Hello!</a> additionally reported Meghan and Harry do not have any scheduled events on the books right now.</p>
      <p>Meghan and Harry will not be spending Christmas with the Queen at Sandringham. William and Kate have not confirmed their holiday plans, but they are reportedly expected to be with the Queen.</p>
      <p>Meghan and Harry's spokesperson announced last week that the couple will be spending their holidays with Meghan's mom. They spent the last two Christmases with the royal family.</p>
      <p>"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to extended family time towards the end of this month," the spokesperson said. "Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchessâ€™ mother Doria Ragland. This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen."</p>
