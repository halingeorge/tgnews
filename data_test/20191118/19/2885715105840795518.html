      <p>Bardoli police said the trio would take order for liquor along with food from customers and deliver them at homes and offices in Bardoli. After receiving a complaint on the same, Bardoli police started investigation and detained two delivery boys of the food supply firm.</p>
      <p>During interrogation, the duo confessed to their involvement in supplying liquor to customers on demand. The liquor bottles were carried in bags containing image of the food delivery company to avoid suspicion, police said.</p>

      <p>Minesh told police that it started when he went to deliver food to a customer in an office on Gandhi road in October. The customer asked him to get liquor bottles from Rashmiben Rathod at Surati Zapa in Bardoli. Minesh took money from the customer, went to the address he gave and got him liquor for a commssion of Rs 100. Later he started supplying liquor on order and took Sathey also along with him. Both of them had their own customer network and were earning good money, police said.</p>
      <p>After the arrest of the deliverymen, police arrested Rashmi Rathod (35), a resident of Surati Zapa in Bardoli town, for selling liquor bottles.</p>
      <p>Bardoli town police inspector M NGilodhar said, “Both the youths were working with the food delivery company for a couple of months and they started deliverying liquor bottles on demand of customers. Police also could not suspect them as they were carrying bags of the food supply company. We have also arrested woman bootlegger, Rashmi Rathod. All the three are on one day police remand in Bardoli police station. We are trying to find out if others are involved in the racket.”</p>
