      <p>For years, tacking a dollar up on the ceiling of <a href="https://www.forbiddenislandalameda.com/">Forbidden Island</a> has been a rite of passage for Alameda residents and visitors. Currency fluttering above the bar is an essential part of the decor, much of it decorated with messages and signatures scrawled in bright marker or artistic additions to the bills figurehead (think George Washington with an afro and sunglasses).</p>
      <p>But in the past year, bar owner Michael Thanos decided that the quaint tradition had reached a tipping point. Out of ceiling space, bar-goers had resorted to pinning bills to booths or the walls or pretty much anywhere they could find space.</p>
      <p>“The dollar bill thing was never part of our design aesthetic, it just happened organically,” Thanos said. “But it really took off in the past eight years.”</p>
      <p>Thanos said he knew it was time to hit reset, so he asked the bar’s staff what they thought they should do with all the money at their next meeting. Donating it to a local charity was the resounding response, so they chose a date to start removing the bills the following week.</p>
      <p>Thanos said staff spent more than five hours taking the money down, realizing it would take much longer than they anticipated to sort and count it. It took almost another month to finish that project during moments when the bar was slow.</p>
      <p>And after years of patrons asking how much the ceiling decoration added up to (General Manager John Peterson said he was asked at least once every shift), their estimations were all much lower than the actual value.</p>
      <p>“The grand total, not including foreign currency, was $10,367," Peterson said. “We put about $1,400 back up on the ceiling and that leaves us with almost $9,000 for donation.”</p>
      <p>The donation will be divided up and split between Building Futures, Friends of the Alameda Animal Shelter and Alameda Family Services.</p>
      <p>The currency that went back on the ceiling included the most unique bills, such as particularly artistic renderings or interesting or rare international bills. Peterson said they have an old Iraqi bill with Saddam Hussein on it, as well as two bills from Zimbabwe, including a 20 billion dollar note and a 10 trillion dollar note.</p>
      <p>Peterson said that most people believe the tradition of tacking a bill up on the wall of a bar began during World War II when sailors would pin a dollar up before leaving port as a good luck charm, only to come back to use it when they returned. But some people have said it could date back to the Gold Rush, when miners didn’t want to wait to trade in their gold nuggets for currency.</p>
      <p>While most visitors are likely paying with a credit card these days, Thanos said he doesn’t think the tradition will stop. He said he estimates it’ll be another five years before the bar is that full again. When that happens, they plan to do exactly the same thing.</p>
      <p>“This will happen again," Thanos said. "People are already putting bills up in anticipation of the next sweep.”</p>
