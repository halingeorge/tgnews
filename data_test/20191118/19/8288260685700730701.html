      <p>The granddaughter of the victim, who asked not to be named, told BirminghamLive: “I am devastated and heartbroken. It’s disgusting.</p>
      <p>“Two ladies approached my nan’s house and came up the drive and tried knocking on the door. Then they left. They came back again and went again.</p>
      <p>“The third time they came back they were hammering on the door. They were laughing and acting cool and collected. They were making jokes and adjusting their scarves.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“You can see it all on my nan’s Nest camera footage.</p>
      <p>“Then my nan answered the and you can hear her say ‘not today’.</p>
      <p>“But they carry on and she lets them in the house.”</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police released images of two women they would like to speak to.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the force said: “We want to speak these women following a distraction burglary on Eachelhurst Road, Sutton Coldfield at 5.30pm on Wednesday, November 6.</p>
      <p>“Two women knocked on the door of an elderly woman pretending to know her.</p>
      <p>“When she refused to let them in, they forced their way past her, before searching the property and taking money from her purse.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately, the woman in her 90s was not physically hurt, but this would have been an extremely distressing ordeal for her, and we are urging anyone who recognises them to get in touch.</p>
