      <h1>'Chewing on a naan bread' - The making of Jack Grealish in the words of his Dad</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa: End of the Decade | What was Jack Grealish doing aged 14 back in 2010? Well, he was still Villa and Gabby mad while playing Gaelic football and enjoyed the odd curry</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Fuelled by balti curries and battle-hardened by Gaelic football - that was Jack Grealish during the turn of 2010.</p>
      <p>The then-14-year-old was seven years into playing for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa's</a> academy as devoted dad Kevin dropped him here, there and everywhere.</p>
      <p>Grealish, though, was still loving GAA and represented John Mitchels in Dorridge, Solihull. The sport, though, according to Grealish's old man really toughened him up and, to some extent, made playing proper football all the more easier.</p>
      <p>"He'd run the show playing Gaelic," Kevin told BirminghamLive. "It really helped him because he was knocked from pillar to post. It's brutal compared to soccer. Jack, as you know, is good with his feet but you can pick the ball up as well and he'd flick it around everyone!</p>

      <p>"I told Gordan Cowans the once. He asked why Jack was so good at expecting tackles and stuff and it was the GAA. It really built up his upper body, players would bounce off him. It's probably why he's so strong today.</p>
      <p>"He had to stop playing at 16, though, they'd just be stamping on his fingers and it became all too much. We had Nike knocking at the door at this point as well who wanted to sponsor him."</p>
      <p>Grealish's love of GAA stemmed from his school days at St Peter's, a Catholic school which really pushed Ireland's national game. "It was a summer sport, Gaelic, and he'd play that non-stop, he didn't care about your crickets or rugbys," dad Kevin added.</p>
      <p>As part of our in-depth End of the Decade Aston Villa series, Kevin reveals that the teenage Grealish was "Gabby mad" growing up. Agbonlahor had just scored his season best goals tally of 13 in the Premier League as Villa, under top Gaelic player himself Martin O'Neill, narrowly missed out on the Carling Cup and Champions League football.</p>
      <p>Villa were at the top of their game and one of the most exciting - and electrifying - sides in the country and Grealish had dreams of joining the first-team in the years to come.</p>

      <p>He'd left school at the age of 15 and was educated at Bodymoor Heath which was, at the time, being redeveloped. When asked about a young Jack around that time, dad Kevin said: "He was just football, football, football. He'd go at it hell for leather and really worked hard.</p>
      <p>"He wasn't the biggest of kids, average to small but the coaches would always push him through the age groups, he'd play against kids two if not three years older. There's usually an influx of kids at academies, most come and go and come back but they wanted to keep Jack with them at all costs.</p>
      <p>"I can still remember taking him for the first time when he was just six, it seems like yesterday which is the scary thing. What he'd love is at the end of every season the first-team would give their match balls away and Jack had one and was absolutely fascinated by it, he'd take it everywhere. That was his ball.</p>

      <h3>Does Jack Grealish deserve an England call up?</h3>
      <h4>3000+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Yes- straight away Not yet- but he will soon No</p>
      <p>"He just couldn't believe the first team players like your Gabbys or Gareth Barrys kicked that ball he had in his garden. He thought it was mad. But Jack was no trouble. He stayed at digs when he was 15, staying in Walmley. It'd usually be two youth team kids per house. Don't get me wrong they were very la-di-da, he'd have his own bathroom and stuff but it taught him to grow up.</p>
      <p>"What would happen is the lads would have to walk to Sutton and they'd get picked up and dropped of there and they'd have to find their own way around. It wasn't Solihull so Jack had to learn. He still speaks to some of the Irish lads who were part of that youth team: Mickey Drennan, Graham Burke and Enda Stevens who's at Sheffield United now. He loved the Irish lads and still makes time for absolutely everyone.</p>
      <p>"I can't imagine him getting away walking around Sutton now, though, he'd be mobbed!"</p>

      <p>Kevin also spoke of Grealish's love of "a good old balti curry" from the family's favourite Bengali restaurant in Moseley, The Diwan.</p>
      <p>"We used to go once a month," added Kev. "It's the exact same place where David Cameron ate with his wife when he was in Birmingham few years back.</p>
      <p>"The first time Jack ever went there he was nine months old chewing on a naan bread. We still go there every now and again but, obviously, not Jack that much now because of his football diet. He's got his own private chef these days. A lot of the players use them. He uses the same one as Harry Kane."</p>
      <p>And while baltis have been binned in favour of steamed fish and chicken, Grealish, like his days playing GAA at 14, is grafting every single week.</p>
      <p>"Now I'm not just saying this," Kevin explained, "but Jack's working like an absolute Trojan at the minute. He's shot up as well, I think he's about 6ft 1in now. He knows it's a short career, just look at Gabby, he's 33 and Jack's giving himself the best-possible shot. He was 19 when he stepped out at Wembley for the first time, there's not many who could have done what he did (against Liverpool), he's just loving every minute."</p>
      <p>As for Grealish, he's still making time for anyone and recently ordered Stevenage striker Jason Cowley some top-of-the-range football boots. The 24-year-old was "knocking down walls a few months ago" before being snapped up from non-league Bromsgrove Sporting.</p>
