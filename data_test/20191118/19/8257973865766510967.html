      <h1>Exporter: Russian foreign military sales on pace to hit $13.7B despite U.S. sanctions</h1>

      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Despite U.S. sanctions, Russian arms sales are on pace to match 2018's export revenue of about $13.7 billion, the head of Russia's state-owned defense export company said Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Sergei_Chemezov/?tps=1">Sergei Chemezov</a>, chief executive officer of Rostec, said at the Dubai Air Show that Russia has confirmed sales of $11 billion so far this year, and expects <a href="https://aviationweek.com/defense/russia-expects-equal-arms-export-record-despite-us-sanctions">to end 2019</a> with between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion in defense-related exports.</p>
      <p>He acknowledged that Rosoboronexport, the country's arms agency, must accelerate its work until the end of the year to meet the goal.</p>
      <p>"We have two months left, so November and December." Chemezov said. "Overall, the sanctions, well, you can hear the results of Rosoboronexport, they're sort of self-explanatory. Last year, Rosoboronexport supplied military technology that was a record in Russian economic activity. This year we will have even higher, but at least no less."</p>
      <p>The annual sales total has become a point of pride in the Russian government, a response to U.S. sanctions imposed in 2017. Russia notably sold its S-400 air defense battery to Turkey, a NATO member, this year despite pressure from the United States, which withdrew its offer to sell advanced F-35 fighter planes to that nation.</p>
      <p>Rosoboronexport sees the cancellation of the F-35 order as an opportunity and is prepared to sell Russian fighter planes to Turkey.</p>
      <p>"We have made our offers," Chemezov said of a possible aircraft purchase by Turkey. "So far, they are reflecting. As soon as they make the decision, we will be ready to sell both Su-35 and Su-57E." India also has purchased the S-400 package.</p>
      <p>Russian arms were sold <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/472454-russia-arms-sales-11-billion/">to 43 countries</a> this year, a Rosoboronexport statement on Friday said.</p>
      <p>"The portfolio of orders of the company keeps at the level of nearly $50 billion, which guarantees the load for Russian defense industry enterprises for several years ahead," the statement added.</p>
      <p>Among the military equipment sold are Su-57 fighter planes, Mi-28NE and Mi-1712SH helicopters, the Tornado-S multiple launch rocket system and the Rubezh-ME coastal tactical missile system.</p>
