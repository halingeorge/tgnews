      <h1>Liverpool ‘can and will spend’ next summer according to reliable reporter David Ornstein</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:36:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1387736/2019/11/18/live-qa-chat-football-with-david-ornstein-mon-18-nov-12pm-gmt-7am-et/">The Athletic’s David Ornstein</a> conducted a Q&amp;A session this afternoon, in which he suggested that the Reds would spend next summer having not done so in the last transfer window.</p>
      <p>It’s not exactly a huge claim – Liverpool, like most sides, spend most summers – but there is a feeling growing that Jurgen Klopp could go big on one or two world-class stars to really ramp the Reds up another level again.</p>
      <p>Ornstein wrote: <b>“As I have more conversations on this ahead of the summer it should become clear, but for now it’s just a personal guess: City, Liverpool can and will spend but don’t have such a pressing need or the same level of resources.”</b></p>
      <p>On the other teams towards the top end of the Premier League table, he added: <b>“Chelsea and United can and will spend but are clearly trying to form a homegrown core to be supplemented by signings.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“The difference, I guess, is that you can see United going huge on somebody like Sancho or Koulibaly. City doesn’t tend to spend such sums on one player.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jadon Sancho, Kylian Mbappe and many more names will be thrown into the ring in terms of potential arrivals, and the club’s targets will become clear over the coming months.</p>
      <p>It makes sense to go for one or two real game-changers given, as Ornstein states, the Reds have no pressing need in any particular position, but the availability of those players is difficult.</p>
      <p>For now, the only thing the Reds can focus on is getting more points on the board in the Premier League. Recruiting new signings will be much easier with even more big trophies in the cabinet.</p>
