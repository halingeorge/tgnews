      <h1>Liverpool fans explain what Jurgen Klopp should do with Xherdan Shaqiri</h1>
      <h2>Xherdan Shaqiri has struggled for game-time under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:25:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-clarke/" target="_blank">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Whilst Liverpool are enjoying a fantastic season so far, it has been another frustrating spell for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/xherdan-shaqiri">Xherdan Shaqiri</a>.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Switzerland star made the switch from Stoke City ahead of the 2018/19 season and provided an instant impact last term.</p>
      <p>He bagged six Premier League goals but his chances became fewer and far between during the back end of the campaign, something which has followed on this term.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri has been widely labelled the 'forgotten man' at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> during what could be a potentially historic season for Jurgen Klopp's side.</p>
      <p>But Shaqiri, whilst feeling dissatisfied by his lack of opportunities, insists he is still fighting for his chance despite starting just four games in 2019 and none at all this season due to injury issues and competition for places.</p>
      <p>"Of course I’m dissatisfied that I do not play more often," Shaqiri said last month. “If that is not the reaction of a pro, he’s in the wrong job. He (Klopp) cannot personally discuss the role of each player, that’s normal. We have a big, talented squad, and many have to wait for their chance."</p>
      <p>The issue of Shaqiri's lack of game-time rose its head again on Monday morning thanks to a piece from ECHO writer Paul Gorst, who suggested that Klopp could still rely on the Swiss star at some point.</p>
      <p>This viewpoint naturally got Liverpool fans talking and led to reaction aplenty.</p>
      <p>The love from Liverpool fans for the player is clear no matter the verdict, though the majority do concur with Gorst's stance. </p>
      <p>Here is some of the best reaction below from Facebook and Twitter, with one fan pointing out the similar situations that Fabinho and Divock Origi found themselves in early last season before they both played key roles for the Reds.</p>
      <p><b>Frank Powell:</b> Keep Shaqs he will get his chance be patient.</p>
      <p><b>Gary Moss:</b> He can be electrifying. Remember that goal on his debut?</p>
      <p><b>Cade Rotol:</b> He's forgotten and then only when we desperately need a goal in the 80th plus minute he's remembered.</p>
      <p><b>Davvydoe Jasper</b> : Same way Fabinho and Origi were not seeing game-time at the beginning of last season, I believe Shaqs will be more helpful in due course. Since there will be more games coming thick and fast, he will eventually help out when the time comes.</p>
      <p><b>Ronald February:</b> Klopp must give him playing time please.</p>
