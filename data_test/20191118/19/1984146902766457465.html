      <h1>Mike Ashley's decade: Newcastle's owner remains unpopular, unorthodox and unbowed</h1>
      <h2>Our End of the Decade series moves onto Mike Ashley, and how the Newcastle United owner has ensured this has been a decade of turbulence at St James' Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Ryder</a></address>
      <p>Mike Ashley's relationship with the local media has been non-existent since the day he walked through the door at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>Within days of Ashley arriving on Tyneside, a Toon insider made it quite clear from the offset: "Mike won't be like Freddy Shepherd, he's been stitched up in the financial Press a few times and doesn't like doing interviews."</p>
      <p>That's why anybody who makes the clumsy claim that the Chronicle or any other local paper are "In Ashley's pocket" couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
      <p>When the Chronicle backed Kevin Keegan over Ashley in 2008, it irked the Buckinghamshire businessman but he never opted to give his side of the story.</p>
      <p>Right at the start of Ashley's stint in charge he did actually find himself in the Press box after a 2-0 win over Barnsley in the League Cup - but this was when the novelty of running a football club was very much in its infancy as he marauded down to the media area to shake hands with Malcolm Macdonald, a player the Sports Direct magnate had admired as a boy.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But he has never returned to the Press benches and each and every time a request to speak to Ashley has gone in, it has either landed on deaf ears or a swift "no thanks" has been pushed back.</p>
      <p>Back in 2015, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mike-ashley-newcastle-united-owner-9320583">when Ashley spoke to Sky Sports before the must win game against West Ham</a>, the Toon owner walked through the mixed zone at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>I asked him: "You must be relieved? (that Newcastle had avoided the drop)"</p>
      <p>Ashley answered: "Oh just a bit."</p>
      <p>Ashley must have known that was coming next, and didn't hang around long enough to do a proper interview, but his reaction was consistent to most of the Press pack's attempts to get him to talk on the record.</p>
      <p>It seems a long time ago since Ashley sat with fans in the away end or bought Geordie punters a beer in Blu Bambu in a black and white shirt.</p>
      <p>However, while Ashley didn't fancy doing interviews the majority of the media, a communication system was set up.</p>
      <p>In the early days, Chris Mort was handed the role of chairman and carried out frequent media sessions where he was open to any type of questions.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>But Mort's exit coincided with a chaotic series of decisions that took Ashley up to the current decade.</p>
      <p>Losing Mort was a bad move, and by the time he replaced him with former London casino chief Derek Llambias, a prickly relationship with Kevin Keegan and the board had started to develop.</p>
      <p>Having won fans over by appointing Keegan to replace the unpopular Sam Allardyce the good work was quickly undone.</p>
      <p>And so started the damage that has never been repaired between Ashley and Newcastle's fanbase.</p>
      <p>In a rare statement, released shortly after Keegan quit, Ashley said: "I am not stupid and have listened to the fans.</p>
      <p>"I have really loved taking my kids to the games, being next to them and all the fans.</p>
      <p>"But I am now a dad who can't take his kids to a football game on a Saturday because I am advised that we would be assaulted.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I am no longer prepared to subsidise Newcastle United."</p>
      <p>More than 11 years on and Ashley is still here.</p>
      <p>The big question would is: Why?</p>
      <p>But those close to him continue to argue that the club has been for sale for most of that time, but none of the parties that have expressed an interest have been able to stump up his asking price or shown proof they will be able to complete all of the payments.</p>
      <p>For now, Newcastle remains a platform for Ashley to draw global attention to Sports Direct as long as he's in charge.</p>
      <p>As we creep towards a new decade with 2020 soon to be upon us, it looks like Ashley will take the club into another chapter of the club's history books.</p>
      <p>Ashley has <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/joelinton-could-worth-every-penny-16818040">broken the transfer record at Newcastle with the signing of Joelinton</a> and offered Rafa Benitez the chance to be the highest paid manager in the club's history last summer.</p>
      <p>But there have also been some big mistakes in the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>Trying to rename St James' Park as the Sports Direct Arena was one of them back in 2011.</p>
      <p>It was a PR disaster that was never going to go down well on Tyneside, and whoever advised the Toon owner it would all be fine, was out of touch.</p>
      <p>The Chronicle refused to call the stadium anything but St James' Park and a headline of "St James' Park - and always will be" again upset the powers that be.</p>
      <p>It was such an insensitive move by the club back then and the sight of a workman using a crow bar to haul the letters off the wall left fans infuriated.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>St James' Park renamed Sports Direct Arena</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But questionable decisions continued to follow.</p>
      <p>On the pitch, the club that used to qualify for Europe on a regular basis have only managed one top five finish and been more accustomed to fighting against relegation.</p>
      <p>Off it there have been too many cases of bad judgement to mention.</p>
      <p>Changing the name of the stadium bar from Shearer's to Nine went down like a lead balloon, and the fact that Shearer's statue is outside the premises on Barrack Road underlines how the club's relationship with its greatest ever goalscorer has dwindled since Ashley fell out with legendary striker in 2009.</p>
      <p>Then there was a media ban for the local Press that stretched from October 2013 to December 2014 over a report over fans taking to the streets to protest against Ashley.</p>

      <p>This resulted in a ridiculous situation in which the Press officer at the time used to block questions in Press conferences at away games with the publication banned all together from home games and home Press conferences.</p>
      <p>Alan Pardew tried to distance himself from the ban, but this came after he'd signed a letter along with then director of Joe Kinnear to kick the Press out.</p>
      <p>On the subject of Kinnear, the fact that United brought Kinnear back in 2013 as director of football for a second time following a disastrous spell as manager tells its own story.</p>
      <p>The Chronicle broke the Kinnear story back then, but it took the club days to confirm it and the former Wimbledon's rant on Talksport - when he branded his star player Yohan "Kebab" - made of another painful episode.</p>
      <p>As we start to look back on the decade that was, another relegation unfolded in 2016 after Newcastle reacted too slowly to a bad start to the season for Steve McClaren.</p>

      <p>By the time they'd managed to persuade Rafa Benitez to take over the club were on the brink of the drop and the Spaniard couldn't save them.</p>
      <p>Those close to Benitez say he offered to take the job much earlier than when he was eventually appointed and the fact that just one more win would have saved Newcastle sums up the fine margins of delaying important decisions.</p>
      <p>The decade has finished uncomfortably for Ashley and the fans.</p>
      <p>A drop in attendances this season come on the back of a power battle with Benitez which ultimately finished up with the Spaniard deciding to leave due to the lack of ambition at the club, when leaving he said: "I lost trust at Newcastle.</p>

      <h3>Newcastle United End of Decade Series</h3>

      <p>As we head towards the year 2020, we've launched a week-long End of Decade series to mark the conclusion of a turbulent 10 years in the history of Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>Here's all the features we've run so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

      </ul>

      <p>"If those in charge had my ambition, I would still be there."</p>
      <p>After a summer of discontent on Tyneside, Ashley opted to give Steve Bruce the job of his dreams, but he arrived into the role amidst a barrage of criticism.</p>
      <p>He has slowly improved the results and Newcastle are actually in better shape than they were 12 months ago points wise.</p>
      <p>But big questions at Newcastle still remain and Ashley doesn't seem keen to answer them soon. </p>
