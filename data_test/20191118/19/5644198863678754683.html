      <p>SINGAPORE: A woman was sentenced to jail for one year and five months on Monday (Nov 18) for conspiring with a former director of a subsidiary of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to cheat the university and its entities of S$191,000.</p>
      <p>Louise Lai, 43, pleaded guilty to five charges mostly of abetment of cheating, with another 10 charges taken into consideration.</p>

      <p>The court heard that Lai and <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/former-director-of-ntu-subsidiary-charged-for-conspiring-to-10974082">co-accused Viktor Cheng Choong Hung</a> were previously colleagues at the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS).</p>
      <p>Cheng later moved on from IPOS and held several jobs at three NTU subsidiaries: Director at  NTU's innovation and enterprise arm NTUitive, director of business and operations at the Institute of Media Innovation (IMI), and chief executive officer at Techbiz Xccelerator (TBX).</p>
      <p>In July 2014, Lai - on Cheng's suggestion - set up consultancy firm I-Knowhow to provide IT, knowledge management and market research services. She was listed as its director.</p>
      <p>In reality, Cheng had control over I-Knowhow in that he sourced for projects for the company and made business decisions concerning it.</p>
      <p>The two agreed to use this company to tender for projects from the three NTU subsidiaries that Cheng helmed. </p>
      <p>Lai knew that there was a conflict of interest, so the pair agreed that Cheng should not be registered as director, shareholder, or have any official connection with I-Knowhow.</p>
      <p>The firm's only business dealings were for the NTU-related projects that Cheng sourced for it.</p>
      <p>The offences occurred between August 2014 and March 2016.</p>
      <p>
        <b>EX-DIRECTOR RECRUITED NTU STUDENT TO DO THE WORK</b>
      </p>
      <p>On one occasion, Cheng instructed Lai to use I-Knowhow's letterhead to prepare a quotation and bid for a job by IMI.</p>
      <p>IMI accepted I-Knowhow's S$36,000 quotation and engaged it as a vendor.</p>
      <p>Instead of fulfilling the services, the pair recruited a freelancer to do so.</p>
      <p>This individual, Carmen Lu Jiawen, had previously been interviewed by Cheng for a job vacancy at TBX after her final year presentation as a student at NTU.</p>
      <p>While doing the I-Knowhow work, Ms Lu was under the impression that it was for TBX.</p>
      <p>However, her salary was later paid by I-Knowhow, instead of by TBX.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FREELANCE CONSULTANT</b>
      </p>
      <p>On another occasion in January 2016, NTU hired Lai in her personal capacity as a freelance consultant for a six-month project at S$6,500 a month.</p>
      <p>After two months, Lai "felt dissatisfied as she felt that the work carried out by her was more than the scope of services stated on the service agreement".</p>
      <p>She told NTU that she needed someone to assist her, and gave the particulars of a Wong Chee Leong as the person to help her. </p>
      <p>Wong was Lai's husband and was not involved in the project, nor did Lai intend for him to be.</p>
      <p>She arranged for a contract to be signed between NTU and her husband.</p>
      <p>The contract stated that Wong would receive S$5,000 per month for six months for work rendered.</p>
      <p>Wong signed the agreement even though he was unable to read it as it was in English.</p>
      <p>In all, NTU and the involved subsidiaries paid S$191,000 in relation to Lai's cheating charges, with no restitution made to date, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Victoria Ting.</p>
      <p>For each count of abetment of cheating, Lai could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined.</p>
      <p>Cheng's case is pending.</p>
