      <h1>UDF govt. roped in Uralungal, says CM</h1>
      <h2>Solution provider for software support to police for passport verification</h2>

      <p>The decision to make Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society Ltd. (ULCCS) as total solution provider for software support to the State police for passport verification was taken during the previous United Democratic Front government’s time, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.</p>
      <p>“It is clear that everyone in this House accepts the efficiency of the ULCCS and which is probably why the State Police Chief also accepted the GO [government order] issued by the previous government and handed over the responsibility of the project to them. The GO issued by the UDF government recognising the ULCCS as total service provider still stands and the Left Democratic Front government has not sought to change it,” Mr. Vijayan said in reply to a question by V. P. Sajeendran, P. T. Thomas and Eldhos Kunnappillil in the Assembly on Monday.</p>
      <h3>POC application</h3>
      <p>As the total service provider, the ULCCS had been asked to submit a project proposal, following which it was asked to develop a Proof of Concept (POC) application.</p>
      <p>The State Police Chief had appointed a technical committee with the Additional Director General of Police (Coastal Security) as the chair to examine the POC in detail.</p>
      <p>The government had not taken any decision to hand over the highly confidential data base of the State police to any private firms, Mr. Vijayan, said in his reply.</p>
