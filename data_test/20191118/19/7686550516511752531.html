      <p>Here are your evening headlines for Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dan Biggar branded 'best in the world'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wales fly-half Biggar has already been back in action for club side Northampton Saints over the weekend and tore it up at Franklin's Gardens.</p>
      <p>He scored 20 points in the English side's impressive 25-14 victory over Lyon in the Champions Cup, orchestrated proceedings with distinction.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Northampton director of rugby Chris Boyd said: “Dan will always do that for you. He is the best in the world at what he does.</p>
      <p>“It was particularly pleasing that Dan and the other World Cup returnees fitted in so well."</p>

        <b>Fears Sarries players will turn their back on England</b>
      </p>
      <p>England boss Eddie Jones has admitted his concern that his Saracens contingent could turn their back on their country in order to ensure the Premiership survival of their club side.</p>
      <p>Sarries have accepted their 35-point deduction and £5.36 million fine for breaching the Gallagher Premiership's salary cap.</p>
      <p>The reigning English and European champions now find themselves rooted to the bottom of the table on -22 points and will now spend much of the season scrapping for their lives.</p>
      <p>Jones fears it may lead to some players not wanting to leave their team-mates in the lurch during the upcoming Six Nations.</p>

      <p>"It could have a significant impact. It's something we need to weigh up and look at very carefully," England boss Jones told BBC Sport.</p>
      <p>"Obviously there may be some dislocation between Saracens players and the rest of the clubs. That's a reality and we may have to work to mend those relationships a bit harder.</p>
      <p>"There might be some Saracens players who feel like they've got to play for their club instead of their country, to make sure they don't go down. So we'll weigh all those up as they come about."</p>

        <b>Wales suffer fresh injury blow</b>
      </p>
      <p>The injuries are really starting to mount up now for new Wales boss Wayne Pivac, who is set to be without prop Tomas Francis for the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>Francis suffered a nasty shoulder injury during the Rugby World Cup semi-final defeat to South Africa. <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/wales-suffer-fresh-injury-blow-17277294">He requires surgery and is expected to be out for up to four months.</a></p>
      <p>Exeter boss Rob Baxter said: “After two or three scans it became clear that Tom needs an operation to repair the shoulder injury he picked up with Wales at the World Cup.</p>

        <b>WRU chief predicts Howley investigation to be concluded within a 'few weeks'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies says he anticipates that the investigation into Rob Howley's alleged breach of World Rugby betting regulations will be concluded in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Howley was relieved of his duties as Wales attack coach in the week leading up to the first game of their Rugby World Cup campaign against Georgia.</p>
      <p>After that, an investigation was put into action and has been ongoing ever since.</p>
      <p>"My understanding is it will hopefully be completed in the next few weeks or so," said Davies.</p>
      <p>"But it’s case of ensuring we do it properly and have all the facts available to us.</p>
      <p>"It’s our investigation and if there’s a case to answer it will go to an independent panel and then the outcome of that I suspect goes to World Rugby."</p>
