      <h1>Lifeline For Forgotten PSL Title Winner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Granwald Scott, the Bidvest Wits midfielder who’s been set back by injuries so far this season, will get a chance to impress before his contract with the Clever Boys is up next month, coach Gavin Hunt has told the Siya crew.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old former Ajax Cape Town skipper has seen his future thrown into doubt after a player exodus at Wits, which was forced by budget cuts, although he remains in the club’s books until the end of the year.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Scott returned home in January 2017 following a stint in Slovakia and immediately became an integral part of the Clever Boys team that went on to clinch the Absa Premiership title, a first championship for the side in their 96-year existence.</p>
      <p>An injury suffered during pre-season has meant that he has not kicked a ball since the start of the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>“He has been injured the whole season so far. But we will re-assess because we still have another whole month with a lot of games. We will try get him a game or two and if he proves himself we will see,” Hunt told the Siya crew.</p>
      <p>Wits will have plenty of action in the coming weeks, bouncing between the domestic league fixtures as well as their CAF Confederation Cup group stages matches. And Scott will hope he is fit and ready to prove he is still worth keeping around.</p>
