      <p>It looks as though Shatta Wale has thrown his weight behind Stonebwoy in his ongoing feud with former signee Kelvynboy which looks far from over.</p>
      <p>However, on a broader spectrum Wale’s posture is in consonance with his own battle with Kweku Smoke which falls in line with what Stonebwoy told Kelvynboy after he reacted to his earlier jabs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/stonebwoy-subtly-throws-new-shots-at-kelvynboy-during-his-performance-at-the-2019-4syte-music-video-awards/">Earlier today we reported that Stonebwoy subtly threw new shots at Kelvynboy</a> during his performance at the 4syteTv Music Video Awards last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Stonebwoy had said:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Big up to Samini, my godfather, and the upcoming wey dem no dey respect, dem for sit well.”</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/kelvynboy-replies-stonebwoy-for-throwing-shots-at-him-during-his-performance-at-the-just-ended-4sytetv-video-awardsscreenshots/">Kelvynboy</a> also shot back saying some people (Stonebwoy) always want to be good in the eyes of others; painting others black forgetting they’re black people too.</p>
      <p>Wading into the brouhaha, Shatta Wale who is also having issues with Kweku Smoke, an artist he wanted to sign and has accused of stealing his song, agreed with Stonebwoy’s assertion.</p>
      <p>He Tweeted;</p>
      <p>
        <b>They never know re – writable CD and Diskette before that be why Dem deh disrespect <a href="https://twitter.com/stonebwoyb">@stonebwoyb</a></b>
