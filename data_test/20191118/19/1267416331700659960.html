      <p>Thousands of <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-ca/welcome?irclickid=VOF3zC0goxyOUHC0TbWK8Xs3Ukn1xaRVrXzgRs0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;cid=DSS-Affiliate-Impact--MobileSyrup-564546">Disney+ accounts</a> have been hacked and put up for sale on the dark web, according to an investigation from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/"><i>ZDNet. </i></a></p>
      <p>The streaming service launched on November 12th in Canada, the United States and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>People took to social media to complain about being locked out of their Disney+ accounts on the service’s launch day. They received emails that their account information had changed.</p>

      <p>Hours after the service launched, accounts were being sold on the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50461171">dark web for as little as $3 USD</a> (approximately $4 CAD). A subscription to <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-ca/welcome?irclickid=VOF3zC0goxyOUHC0TbWK8Xs3Ukn1xaRVrXzgRs0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;cid=DSS-Affiliate-Impact--MobileSyrup-564546">Disney+ costs $8.99 CAD per month.</a></p>
      <p>The stolen accounts on the dark web displayed the type of subscription the user signed up for and when the account expires.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued to <i>MobileSyrup</i>, a Disney spokesperson said that “Disney takes the privacy and security of our users’ data very seriously and there is no indication of a security breach on Disney+.”</p>
      <p>A cybersecurity expert told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50461171"><i>BBC News</i></a> that hackers were likely able to access the accounts because people use the same password for many different accounts. Hackers are able to lift a password from a different site that was previously hacked and use it to access Disney+ accounts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-ca/welcome?irclickid=VOF3zC0goxyOUHC0TbWK8Xs3Ukn1xaRVrXzgRs0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;cid=DSS-Affiliate-Impact--MobileSyrup-564546">Disney+ also does not have two-factor authentication,</a> which is when a separate password is sent after a login to verify identify.</p>
      <p>Users have reported waiting on telephone and online chat lines for hours, while many say that the problems have not been sorted out, as reported by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50461171"><i>BBC News.</i></a></p>
      <p>The streaming service faced issues on launch day as several users reported<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-outage-canada-launch-day/"> technical problems</a> with the platform.</p>
