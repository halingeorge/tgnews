      <p>It was sometime in 2018 when Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson suggested that it was more fun to play for the Philadelphia Eagles than it is to play for the New England Patriots.</p>
      <p>As you know, the Patriots don’t forget anything, but who knew it would be Bill Belichick to respond.</p>
      <p>Following Sunday’s victory over the Eagles — Belichick used a word he almost never uses to describe an NFL game.</p>
      <p>He said it was fun.</p>
      <blockquote>“They just did a good job,” Belichick said of his players. “It looked like everyone had fun out there today and we played a lot of good energy and it was good to come down here and get a win.”<br/><br/>“Everyone had fun out there today.”</blockquote>

      <p>That definitely seems like a response to Lane Johnson.</p>
      <p>Johnson would go on “Pardon My Take” to try to clarify his message when he said the following: “If that stuff ends up getting on their bulletin board, I just don’t know what I’m going to do. We’re going to get a spell put on us, and we’re going to lose.”</p>
      <p>After the Patriots lost to Baltimore two weeks ago, Johnson took to Twitter and stated, “Gonna have some fun at the Linc in 2 weeks!”</p>
      <p>The Eagles did not have fun.</p>
