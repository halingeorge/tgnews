      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/unlikely-animal-friends-photos-2019-8">Unlikely friendships</a> are the most fun to root for. Especially when both parties are adorable, fluffy animals.</p>
      <p>Diana Grib’s dog, Nova, and her ferret, Pacco, became best buds when she added Pacco to the family four months ago. She shares photos of their adventures and snuggles on <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/instagram">Instagram</a>, each snapshot cuter than the last (seriously, someone give them a sitcom already).</p>
      <p>Here are a few highlights from their blossoming friendship.</p>

      <p>“It took only one day for them to become best buds, as they couldn’t resist playing with each other,” she told Insider.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Grib describes Nova as “an extremely energetic and social dog” who loves to be the center of attention.</h3>

      <p>Ferrets are <a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/all-other-pets/ferrets/providing-a-home-for-a-ferret">usually playful and sociable, but also territorial</a>, according to the Merck Manual.</p>
