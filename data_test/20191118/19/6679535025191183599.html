      <p>Paving the way for a leadership change in the Kochi Corporation, four chairpersons of the civic body have been asked to step down. However, no formal decision has been taken in the case of Mayor Soumini Jain.</p>
      <p>District Congress Committee president T.J. Vinod, MLA, wrote to A.B. Sabu, chairperson of welfare standing committee, K.V.P. Krishnakumar, chairperson of tax appeal standing committee, Shiny Mathew, chairperson of town planning standing committee, and Gracy Joseph, chairperson of development standing committee, asking them to step down.</p>
      <p>Mr. Vinod confirmed the developments and said the chairpersons were told to put in their papers within a week.</p>

      <h3>Power-sharing deal</h3>
      <p>The decision asking them to step down was taken in accordance with the power sharing agreement made earlier.</p>
      <p>The chairpersons were supposed to step down after completing two-and-a-half years in office. However, the decision could not be implemented due to various reasons, said party sources.</p>
      <p>The delayed decision had created internal strife in the party as a few senior leaders were denied the berths.</p>

      <p>The new chairpersons will be elected after the four submit their resignations.</p>
      <p>A decision on the Mayor would be taken by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leadership as the political affairs committee of the party had entrusted the responsibility with KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran, said party sources.</p>
