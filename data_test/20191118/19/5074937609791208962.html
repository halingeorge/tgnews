      <p>Accra, Nov. 18, GNA - Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum, a Deputy Minister of Education in-charge of Basic and Secondary Education, has urged young people to use every opportunity that come their way to become the best in the sphere of life.</p>
      <p>He said coming from a poor background was not an excuse for one not to take opportunities and chances that come their way.</p>
      <p>He also urged them to be super determined to break the cycle of poverty in their families.</p>
      <p>"If you are lucky to come from a home of affluence, then why should you do less than your parents, so whether you are rich or poor you can be successful by taking advantage of good situations," Dr Adutwum remarked over the weekend at the opening of a three- day hackathon competition in Accra.</p>
      <p>A hackathon is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others, often including domain experts, collaborate intensively on software projects.</p>
      <p>The programme, which being organised by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Ecobank and Plan International, is on the theme "Generation Unlimited Youth Challenge: 2019/20".</p>
      <p>The young people are grouped in 15 teams with facilitators, peer leaders and mentors and each group is ready to speak for themselves, it would be diversity of situations and minds.</p>
      <p>Dr Adutwum said the fears of determination to succeed could make one set higher standard to excel; adding that "so don't think you are an average person, you can do great things to attain greater height".</p>
      <p>He advised young girls not to limit themselves because they could do better when determined; declaring that mentorship was a good thing so young people should get mentors to make good choices.</p>
      <p>Madam Marie Pierre, UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa, said the launch of the youth challenge 2019/20 was to support young people to identify concrete solution to the problems being faced in all countries related to education and employment.</p>
      <p>She said this challenge was actively organised in 40 countries worldwide; adding that the young people would share ideas, suggestions and vitality of grammar.</p>
      <p>Mr Samuel Hiram Yaro, Regional Head Operations and Technical, Ecobank said: "It doesn't matter which region you are from, when you learn hard and utilized opportunities such as this programme, you would make your dreams a reality".</p>
      <p>He said Ecobank was partnering UNICEF and other stakeholders to celebrate 30 years since the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p>"We are commemorating this event with series of activities with the key ones being today's Hackathon, we are about to witness," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Solomon Tesfamariam, Country Director Plan International Ghana, said their core business was advancing the life of children particularly focusing on quality improvement of boys and girls, and that young people who were generational thinkers were good for the country.</p>
      <p>He said the programme was a unique opportunity for young people to share ideas and also contribute significantly to the economy.</p>
      <p>Madam Silks Hollander, UNDP Acting Resident Representative in Ghana, said the young people were all winners if they have the right mind set.</p>
      <p>She said the youth were the change agents across Ghana and the world; " So it is a huge responsibility and with this opportunity. They should use it to learn from each other".</p>
