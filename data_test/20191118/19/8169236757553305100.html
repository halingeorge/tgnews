      <p>Flamengo goalkeeper Hugo was viciously attacked by several Corinthians players after his side’s crucial 2-1 victory in the second-leg of the Campeonato Brasileiro Under-20’s semi-final.</p>
      <p>The clash ended 0-0 but Flamengo advanced after winning the first-leg 2-1. TalkSPORT report that Hugo made a key penalty save in the match and perhaps this is why he was attacked.</p>
      <p>After the match ended, several Corinthians players threw sucker punches towards the goalkeeper – Raul Gustavo shocking attacked the stopper with a flying superman punch.</p>
