      <h1>Two inter-county hurlers sent home from US after video shows player fighting fan</h1>
      <h2>Shocking video footage circulated today showing the two young men trade blows until one falls backwards onto a concrete path</h2>

      <p>An inter-county hurler and a fan battered each other on a street during a tournament in New York - ending with one floored with a savage punch.<br/><br/>Shocking video footage circulated today showing the two young men trade blows until one falls backwards onto a concrete path.</p>
      <p>Two members of a county squad have been kicked home early from the tournament - the player involved in the fight and his fellow panellist who took the video.</p>
      <p>The fan is a supporter of the county for which the men play and travelled to the States for the tournament.<br/><br/>The player who took the footage is alleged to have shared the video in a players’ WhatsApp group, which was then shared widely on social media.<br/><br/>Both he and the brawling player were sent home by their manager on Sunday, 24 hours before the rest of the squad were due to arrive back home today.<br/><br/>Four hurling counties were represented at the New York Hurling Classic in the Big Apple over the weekend.<br/><br/>The source said: “They [players] were specifically asked not to do any video stuff, or take any videos while they were away, so (the player) breached that request.”<br/><br/>The video, circulated on Twitter and Facebook, shows two young men throwing punches and grabbing one another on a street with skyscrapers in the background.</p>
      <p>One of them falls to the ground after the other appears to throw a punch at him, and a voice is heard shouting: “stop, stop, stop”.<br/><br/>The brawl happened last Friday night, but the county management team did not become aware of it until later.<br/><br/>The source added: “When word of this broke, (their manager) sent the two (players) home early from New York.</p>
      <p>“The players were out socialising and they got caught up in this. “I don’t know what led to it and (one player) ended up having fisticuffs on the side of the street.</p>
      <p>“It looks terrible.<br/><br/>“There’s a chance these guys are going to get dropped. There’s a new panel going to be announced in the next week or two, ahead of the National Hurling League, and these things are not helpful.<br/><br/>“I think supporters are kind of a bit shocked by the whole thing now at this stage. This (video) was widely circulated all over the country. Everyone has seen it, so it’s not going down well.<br/><br/>“It might be a bit hard luck on the two lads, they’re only young fellas, but still, it’s messy. It’s the talk of the country, and the sad thing about this is these lads could get destroyed in the process. Even though it’s stupid behaviour, they’re bringing {their county’s] reputation into disrepute and all that.<br/><br/>“The last punch that left your man to the ground - wow - he could have seriously hurt him doing that.”<br/><br/>A spokesman for the county board concerned refused to comment on the fight. </p>
