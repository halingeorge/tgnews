      <p>Cape Town - <b>Zander Lombard</b> stated that he is definitely one to look out for in the next future after completing a Top 10 finish at the <b>Nedbank Golf Challenge</b> in Sun City this past weekend.</p>
      <p>The South African golfer led heading into the final round but failed to secure his second professional win as he faltered in Sun City.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old signed a scorecard of 77 to finish the tournament T8 on 6-under.</p>
      <p>Lombard revealed that his putts had let him down, however admitted that he is now more determined to come back stronger next season.</p>
      <p>"I don't know, the putts just didn't go in... I feel so confident but it just didn't happen and that's the game," Lombard told reporters on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Even Louis said to me, you played great, you were unlucky today. That's all it was and I'll put this down to experience and make the best of it and come back stronger."</p>
      <p>Lombard has surprisingly only one professional win - winning on the Sunshine Tour <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/SunshineTour/lombard-claims-maiden-sunshine-tour-title-20180818">last year at the Origins of Golf</a> at Zebula.</p>
      <p>He was however confident that his second win would be just "around the corner".</p>
      <p>"I think I've matured enough in the last six or seven months, a wins got to be around the corner," said Lombard.</p>
      <p>"I've got to keep doing what I've been doing. I start with a fresh season at Leopard Creek so I'm really going to try and win it.</p>
      <p>"Look at it from a bigger picture, it's a Top 10 finish in a Rolex series event, a lot of positives to take out into the next season."</p>
      <p>Lombard, who pocketed a cool R2 million for his finish, said that he could not have been more proud of his debut performance.</p>
      <p>"It's been an amazing week, the crowd has been backing me for two days. As a debut in Sun City, which is the toughest golf course in Africa, it's nice to know that I can compete with the big guys," said the 207th-ranked golfer.</p>
      <p>"Like I said, a lot of positives into the next season and keep an eye on me."</p>
