        <b>A number of Nottingham Forest fans have taken to Twitter to react to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10359744/everton-nottingham-forest-matty-cash-january/">reports from The Sun suggesting</a> that Everton are preparing a bid for Matty Cash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cash has been excellent for Sabri Lamouchi’s men this season. He has scored two goals and contributed two assists having predominantly played at right-back for Forest.</p>

      <p>His form has not gone unnoticed however. The Sun reports that the Toffees are interested in the 22-year-old, while Southampton and Crystal Palace are also amongst his admirers.</p>
      <p>It appears to be Everton who are looking to steal a march on their rivals. The report suggests that Marco Silva’s men are planning to make a £12 million bid for Cash ahead of the January window.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10359744/everton-nottingham-forest-matty-cash-january/">The Sun adds</a> that Everton have scouted the academy graduate on a number of occasions. And it is suggested that Forest may struggle to keep the youngster should he decide that he wants to leave the City Ground with his contract expiring in 2021.</p>
      <p>However, it seems that the Forest supporters on social media are not concerned about losing Cash. They believe that he has little reason to leave when Lamouchi’s men are making so much progress.</p>
      <p>And some have warned that Everton will need to pay significantly more than £12 million if they hope to even hope to open talks with Cash. Some are adamant that he should not be sold at any price.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the Forest fans make of Everton’s reported interest…</p>
