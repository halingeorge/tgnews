      <p>The Special Operations Group (SOG) of Rajkot city Sunday arrested a paan shop owner and recovered around 2 kg of marijuana from his possession. The accused, Pratipalsinh Jadeja (21), a resident of Bajrangwadi area of the city, was arrested for a similar offence three months ago with 6 kg of marijuana.</p>
      <p>“In view of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani’s visit to Rajkot, we launched a combing operation on Sunday. While we were passing by Lothda village at around 11:45 pm, we found a man near the bus stop with a new motorbike. When we looked a little closer, we could identify him as Jadeja, the paan-shop owner who was arrested in July this year with 6 kg of marijuana. We frisked him and found 1.989 kg of marijuana in his possession,” SOG police inspector Rohit Raval said.</p>
      <p>Rupani was to visit his hometown Rajkot Monday to attend a public event organised to pay tributes to a group of soldiers who had laid down their lives in the Indo-China war.</p>
      <p>Raval said Jadeja was arrested by SOG in July after he was caught with 6.100 kg of marijuana. He could not produce any licence for it. He was booked by ‘A’ Division police under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.</p>
      <p>“Jadeja was granted bail in the NDPS case. However, one of his bail conditions was that he would not misuse his personal liberty or indulge in any criminal activity. Now, we have the option of approaching the court to get his bail in the earlier case cancelled as he has been booked again for a similar offence,” Raval further said, adding the accused himself is an addict of the banned weed.</p>
      <p>The police also seized weighing scales, a mobile phone and a motorbike from Jadeja. An offence has been registered under the NDPS Act at Aji Dam police station. Later on Sunday evening, police produced Jadeja in a local court and secured his remand till Friday. “During interrogation, Jadeja claimed that he has a habit of smoking marijuana and that he had purchased the contraband from one Vinod in Surat,” Mehul Rathod, in charge police inspector of Aji dam police station, said.</p>
