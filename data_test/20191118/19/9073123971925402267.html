        <b>The new Fortnite update, set to release this week, will add GPU support for PC players to improve performance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The next Fortnite update, v11.20, is assumed to be coming out this week. We could see the update as soon as tomorrow. As is the case with all Fortnite Chapter 2 updates, there likely won’t be any patch notes attached.</p>
      <p>We don’t know about any new items or weapons coming to the game, nor do we know if Epic will tweak the current Fortnite loot pool. We’re still waiting on the <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/when-will-the-bandage-bazooka-return-to-fortnite/27804/">Bandage Bazooka to return,</a> which doesn’t seem likely this week.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>One thing we do know about v11.20, though, is that Epic will be adding support for PC players using the Microsoft DirectX 12. All previous updates forced players to run Microsoft DirectX 11, instead.</p>

      <p>Epic posted a blog covering the topic on November 18, stating that “PC players with high-end GPUs may experience a higher and steadier frame rate. This is because DX12 delivers better CPU performance and allows for the distribution of rendering jobs across multiple cores.”</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The team also plans to expand Fortnite’s capabilities in the graphics department to fully utilize the DX12. You will have to opt into these features to use them in-game.</p>

      <p>What does this mean for the Fortnite experience? The most obvious improvement comes in competitive late-game situations. Players regularly experience frame drops when there are dozens of players alive in a final circle.</p>

      <p>The new GPU support should help improve these instances, although nothing will help the server lag that all of the building causes. Are you excited for the new GPU update to Fortnite? Let us know in the comments.</p>
