      <h1>Luis Enrique to Arsenal: Spanish boss set for dramatic return to management</h1>
      <h2>Former Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has previously been linked with a move to Arsenal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:14:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:14</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha, Lee Wilmot, Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal are said to have given Unai Emery a month to save his job.</p>
      <p>The Gunners boss has overseen a downturn in form of late, with a 2-0 loss against Leicester before the international break pouring on the pressure.</p>
      <p>Emery's side are without a win in four Premier League games, and are now eight points off the top four with just 12 games played.</p>
      <p>There has been lots of speculation about whether the Gunners will part ways with the Spanish coach - and who could replace him if he does leave the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>One of those frequently named has been former Barcelona and Spain head coach Luis Enrique.</p>
      <p>Here's what we know so far about the talk surrounding the former midfielder and a possible move to north London.</p>
      <h3>Raul Sanllehi contact</h3>
      <p>Arsenal have been eager to deny links with Jose Mourinho already this month.</p>
      <p>And they may have to start talking about whether or not they are in talks with Luis Enrique soon, too.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Kike_Marin_/status/1192571989707374593?s=20">El Confidencial</a> , Enrique is a candidate to take over at the Emirates if Emery is sacked.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Spanish journalist Kike Marin has indicated on his official Twitter page that there has been contact between enrique and Arsenal's head of football Raul Sanllehi.</p>
      <p>Marin said that Sanllehi was "looking for a substitute" and that there had been talks with Enrique over being that replacement.</p>

      <h3>What Enqrique has said about managing in England</h3>
      <p>Luis Enrique has been linked with a job in England before.</p>
      <p>He was once linked with taking over at Reading in 2013 and was asked about that during a Q&amp;A with magazine <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/luis-enrique-one-one-id-manage-england-some-point-fans-are-faithful?page=0%2C2">FourFourTwo</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: ""I was cycling in South Africa when I got a call about Reading.</p>
      <p>"It was gossip, I never spoke to them. I’d like to manage in England at some point.</p>
      <p>"My wife wouldn’t like the weather, she’s from Barcelona and likes the sun. It would depend on the team and the football they played."</p>
      <h3>Chelsea links</h3>
      <p>When Maurizio Sarri was announced as Chelsea boss last summer, there had been talks about a move for Enrique.</p>
      <p>Talks were held but Chelsea reportedly pulled out of a move for the Spaniard as they found him 'too arrogant'.</p>
      <p>Spanish outlet Marca claimed Roman Abramovich wasn't given good feedback when director Marina Granovskaia went out to meet him.</p>

      <p>"The conversations with [Luis Enrique] didn't have a happy ending. Marina Granovskaia is Roman Abramovich person of trust and is in charge of all areas of the club, especially the sporting side of things," the Madrid-based newspaper explained.</p>
      <p>"At first, in January and February, it seemed as if the meetings would end with some kind of agreement, but Luis Enrique's personality put the brakes on that."</p>

      <h3>Managerial odds</h3>
      <p>There are plenty of names in the frame to replace Emery at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Emery is currently the third favourite, behind Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl and Spurs' Mauricio Pochettino, to be the first manager to lose his job in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>And Enrique is the second favourite to replace Emery should he move on.</p>
      <p>According to Paddy Power, Enrique is 5/1 to take over from Emery, with only Jose Mourinho ahead of him in the betting.</p>
      <h3>Enrique's stance</h3>
      <p>Luis Enrique is not ready to return to management and take the Arsenal job if Unai Emery is sacked.</p>
      <p>The former Barcelona manager left his post as Spain manager earlier in the year after the tragic death of his daughter.</p>
      <p>Enrique was linked with the Arsenal job amid the struggles of Emery, who is fighting a face to keep his job.</p>
      <p>But according to <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/arsenal/story/3986389/sources-arsenal-back-unai-emery-luis-enrique-not-an-option">ESPN</a>, Enrique isn’t keen on returning to management just yet as he prefers to build projects - meaning a mid season arrival at Arsenal isn't on his agenda.</p>
      <p>For now, Arsenal are willing to give Emery time to turn things around.</p>
      <h3>Sanllehi 'sounds out' Enrique</h3>
      <p>According to Spanish journalist Kike Marin, Unai Emery is 'aware' that his job is at risk if results do not improve within the next month.</p>
      <p>The Arsenal boss is reportedly under no illusions that he could be sacked at Christmas if the Gunners do not pick up wins in their next four games.</p>
      <p>Marin also claims that head of football Raul Sanllehi will let Emery keep his job for now, but the Arsenal chief is also sounding out potential replacements like Luis Enrique.</p>

      <h3>Enrique to return to Spain?</h3>
      <p>Luis Enrique will reportedly be making a sensational return to management as the Spanish national team boss.</p>
      <p>Enrique vacated the post in June 2019 following the passing of his daughter Xana.</p>
      <p>Since then, his former assistant Roberto Moreno has been in charge, winning three games and drawing two.</p>
      <p>But according to <a href="https://twitter.com/partidazocope/status/1196497280733454336">Cadena Cope</a>, Enrique could be set to make a return to management, with the Spanish national team ready to announce his return "imminently".</p>
      <p>Enrique would be ready to take charge for the upcoming European Championships in summer 2020, after they finished top of Group F in qualifying.</p>
