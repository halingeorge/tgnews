      <p><b>JOHANNESBURG — </b>Scotland are set to be the first opponents of new world champions South Africa, with tests in the republic on July 4 and 11.</p>
      <p>Although SA Rugby have not confirmed who they will host in a mid-year series, a source told AFP that "Scotland are coming for two matches during July".</p>
      <p>South Africa have won 22 tests and lost five against Scotland and the last meeting, in Edinburgh a year ago, ended 26-20 in favor of the Springboks.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, mid-year visitors to South Africa play three tests, but Scotland cannot do so as they face New Zealand in Dunedin on July 18.</p>
      <p>It is understood SA Rugby want to play another team on July 18 as they seek to cash in on the popularity of the team that beat England 32-12 this month in the Rugby World Cup final.</p>
      <p>"The Springboks can fill any stadium in South Africa twice over right now and, ideally, it would be another six nations team," the source said.</p>
      <p>All the six nations drawcards have arranged July 4 and 11 tests with England facing Japan, Wales meeting New Zealand, Ireland playing Australia and France tackling Argentina.</p>
      <p>But none of the four touring teams have announced a July 18 opponent, creating the possibility that one of them could play a one-off test in South Africa.</p>
