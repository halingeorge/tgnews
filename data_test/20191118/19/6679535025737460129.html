      <h1>T.N. Thowheed Jamath takes out protest rally over Ayodhya judgment</h1>
      <h2>‘Verdict a great injustice to us, deprives us of our masjid’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:56:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:56</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Over 2,000 members of the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath held a major demonstration condemning the recent Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute in Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>They said the historically renowned and ancient Babri Masjid was illegally and undemocratically demolished by anti-social elements in 1992. Then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao gave an assurance that the mosque would be built in the same place, they noted.</p>
      <h3>‘Promise not fulfilled’</h3>
      <p>This promise was never fulfilled, and the Muslim community had been carrying out democratic protests for over a decade, demanding action against the perpetrators of the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the handover of the land on which it stood to Muslims.</p>
      <p>E. Mohammed, general secretary, said, “To our disappointment, the Supreme Court decided its verdict based on belief. It was a great injustice to us and we have been deprived of our Masjid. If the verdict had been delivered based on facts and the law of the land, we would have accepted it. This is our protest to show our displeasure against the injustice rendered on us.”</p>
      <p>The protesters raised slogans and held placards against the SC judgment. Traffic was affected on Walajah Road, Bells Road and other adjoining roads in Triplicane.</p>
