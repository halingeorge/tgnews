      <p>An elementary school in Kansas is making headlines again after half of its teachers gave birth in a span of eight months.</p>
      <p>In March, Oak Street Elementary <a href="https://www.insider.com/teachers-at-one-elementary-school-are-pregnant-2019-3">announced that seven out of the school’s 15 teachers were pregnant</a>. One of the women was even expecting twins. Through October, the teachers gave birth one by one, and in November the school announced that the mothers had welcomed a total of eight healthy babies.</p>
      <p>Last week, most of the mothers returned to teaching from maternity leave and they brought the six girls and two boys together for the first time. They <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPublicSchoolsUSD265/posts/1459829114155166?__xts__[0]=68.ARAUAlK3ywA1TxqufhrkFk-YJWMkuJ1XA1Hq0pGCYXGENlQ0G9SbVwjlBLp-DXqhjc8yB5AqglIz4_CTAWWYQ8lEz0C3TSECz0aVjHMFxLKs7dP0ulRvC3uzhJwI_TcWoKwVdwq9vV-zi5rR19lHz-k-tVlhC-jAcBL9EN3AaJFCAtVOy9-_QYc3zuHzLha0lmxe-DVzhZX9ehvcpKiYTQRJvkXYLvYDpSPJDQWZmA0_3mI95GpbRncbidb3-zSR44lWtIhwNf1RfqugKgJsLcePGxI2QVtmlf3lE6o18WnT4rhmP14knM-aWZ4-BY-dL0s1iosPdfHCRf7T4DrV94Ck8g&amp;amp;__tn__=-R">took an adorable photo of the babies</a> in the Oak Street hallway.</p>

      <p>“We always felt like Oak Street Elementary was like a little family,” Kelli Jo Sheahon, one of the teachers who had twin girls in September, said. “But this just adds another element. We’re really sharing our personal families with one another, communicating with one another, and helping each other out. We are sharing a more intimate part of our lives with our co-workers.”</p>
      <p>The mothers said they have a group chat where they help each other out by offering tips and advice.</p>
      <p>“When we need advice, we are the first people that we turn to,” said Tara Johnson, another teacher who had a girl in March.</p>
      <p>Sheahon said some of the other mothers even gave her baby clothes when their kids grew out of them.</p>

      <p>Behind the scenes, Principal Ashley Miller has been coordinating maternity leaves for several months, having past teachers and principals come out of retirement to substitute for the mothers. Now, Miller is creating a master schedule for the school that works around the teachers who need to breast pump throughout the day.</p>
      <p>Although it has been a “crazy ride” for Miller, she’s happy it all worked out.</p>
      <p>“I did breathe a sigh of relief when the last babies were born and were healthy,” Miller told Insider. “We were really blessed that all the moms and all the babies were healthy.”</p>
      <p>The teachers have become celebrities in their community, known as the “Oak Street mommas,” but the mothers said they are focusing on raising their children and looking forward to the future.</p>
      <p>“I think in a few years when they all start school, it’ll be really fun to watch them grow up together,” Miller said.</p>
