      <p>According to Mama Zimbi, no matter how many times she is criticised she is never going to change her style of hosting her midnight “adult” show.</p>
      <p>“A spade must be called a spade; the hypocrisy is too much. If I describe the genitals in English, there won’t be a problem but when I call it natively, there is trouble,” she lamented on Hitz FM’s Daybreak Hitz.</p>
      <p>Contrary to public perception, Akumaa Mama Zimbi who hosts “Odo Ahomaso” explained that the intention behind her show is to give sexual education that will help married couple maintain a healthy relationship rather than promote profanity.</p>
      <p>“The sex bit is just the tip of the iceberg but because people don’t listen to the show, they attribute it to profanity. They lack education on the essence of the show. I educate women on how to walk, talk, cook, lay bed and not just preach about intimacy,” she stated.</p>
      <p>Mama Zimbi further bemoaned that she is unperturbed by the backlash she constantly receives from the public.</p>
