      <h1>Shiv Sena set to retain BMC Mayor’s post</h1>
      <h2>Kishori Pednekar will be elected unopposed on November 22</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:52:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Tanvi-Deshpande-19168/" target="_blank">Tanvi Deshpande</a></address>
      <p>With neither the BJP nor the Congress-NCP fielding a candidate, Shiv Sena’s Kishori Pednekar is set to become Mumbai’s 77th Mayor on November 22.</p>
      <p>Ashish Shelar of the BJP tweeted on Monday that the party was not fielding a candidate now for want of numbers, but would be aiming for the Mayor’s post in 2022. Congress leaders did not field a candidate as per party orders.</p>
      <p>The term of the current Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar ends on November 21 and the election for the next Mayor and deputy mayor is scheduled for November 22. Nominations had to be submitted on Monday at the office of the municipal secretary.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena nominated Worli corporator Kishori Pednekar for the post of Mayor and Malad corporator Suhas Wadkar for the deputy mayor’s post.</p>
      <p>Against the backdrop of the continued political crisis in the State, and Shiv Sena being engaged in talks with Congress-NCP to possibly form a government, political observers were keenly wat ching whether BJP and Congress would put up candidates. The only scenario in which a BJP corporator could have been elected Mayor was with the support of Congress-NCP. The 227-corporator general assembly of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has 94 Sena corporators, 81 BJP and 37 Congress-NCP, apart from smaller parties and nominated corporators.</p>
      <p>But neither BJP, nor Congress-NCP fielded anyone, paving the way for the two to be elected unopposed. In 2017, Congress had fielded corporator Vitthal Lokare for the Mayor’s post but BJP had voted in favour of Mr. Mahadeshwar.</p>
      <p>Congress leader in BMC Ravi Raja said on Monday, “We held a meeting with all corporators and later, with senior regional Congress committee members. Party seniors told us not to field a candidate for this election as we do not have the numbers.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Pednekar is a three-time corporator from Worli and was ranked number 1 in Praja Foundation’s councillor report card of 2017-18. She helped with Aaditya Thackeray’s campaign during the Assembly elections and has been actively involved in his work after the elections.</p>
      <p>Mr. Wadkar is a corporator from Malad.</p>
