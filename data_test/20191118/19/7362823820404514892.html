      <p>An <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/india">Indian national</a> is accused of committing sexual assault while working as a U.S. contractor in Afghanistan, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department">Department of Justice</a> said Monday.</p>
      <p>Lokesh Naik, 35, was charged earlier this month by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia with two counts of aggravated sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact, the DOJ said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/indian-national-charged-aggravated-sexual-abuse-while-working-us-military-contractor">press release</a>.</p>
