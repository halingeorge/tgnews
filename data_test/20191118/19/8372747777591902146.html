      <p>A campaign launched by South Dakota's Gov. Kristi Noem is grabbing attention for its slogan "Meth: We're on it."</p>
      <p>As part of the campaign, a video released on Monday features a number of people of differing ages and backgrounds saying "I'm on meth."</p>
      <p>Given the national attention the ad campaign has garnered, Noem's goal to bring attention to the issue appears to be working.</p>
      <p>"I allocated money for meth education and awareness," Noem said. "Right now, my team is accepting bids from media companies for a targeted meth awareness campaign. We need to be more active and intentional in teaching kids the danger of meth use and the affect it can have on their lives."</p>
      <p>The state also launched a website that includes information on where to find treatment centers and other resources to fight meth addiction.</p>
      <p>According to Noem's office, 13 people died from meth in 2018, and more than 3,000 were arrested for meth offenses.</p>
