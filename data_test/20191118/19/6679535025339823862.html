      <p>India Posts Payments Bank (IPPB) is gradually gaining ground among customers with nearly one lakh savings accounts opened in Chennai city region alone in one year.</p>
      <p>Launched in September last year, IPPB has six branches and 1,827 post offices as access points across the Chennai city region.</p>
      <p>Officials of the postal department noted that doorstep banking services, money transfers to any bank account and zero minimum balance were some of the factors that attracted customers.</p>
      <p>As part of its campaign, the department is also approaching Members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assembly to open IPPB accounts, apart from holding camps. While 26 accounts of MPs and MLAs have been opened in CCR, 13 MPs and MLAs in Chennai now have IPPB accounts.</p>
      <p>Officials said in Tamil Nadu circle, a total of 4,71,455 savings accounts and 1,586 current accounts have been opened so far. Of this, nearly 88,551 IPPB savings accounts have been opened in Chennai city alone.</p>
      <h3>Doorstep services</h3>
      <p>R. Anand, Postmaster General, Chennai City Region, said customers could schedule doorstep banking services such as withdrawal through the helpline (155299) for the next day, and a postman would carry out the transaction.</p>
      <p>Besides bill payments, customers could also transfer money to any bank account. However, customers would only be able to maintain a deposit of ₹1 lakh. “We advise them to link accounts to post office savings account to transfer money. IPPB account would also function as mobile wallet where customers, especially in rural areas, could carry out digital transactions. Customers could also use an Aadhaar-linked bank account to perform banking transactions,” he said. In Chennai city region, about 8,000 transactions have been done so far through Aadhaar-enabled services.</p>
      <p>The department has also covered 67 villages in Chennai City region under Project Abhimaan, wherein every household and merchant in the village would have an IPPB account. Moreover, direct benefit transfer payments are also being done through IPPB.</p>
