      <p>The Technical Evaluation Committee of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has given the “clearance” to establish three more government medical colleges in Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>The State government had applied seeking permission to establish the colleges in Krishnagiri, Nagapattinam and Tiruvallur districts.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Beela Rajesh on Monday made a presentation to the committee in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>The final decision on establishing the colleges will be taken by the Empowered Committee of the Union Health Ministry, official sources said.</p>
      <p>“The Technical Evaluation Committee has cleared the proposal. Officials had to give a number of reasons for seeking medical colleges in these districts. For Nagapattinam, the emphasis was laid on the district having a long coastal line, and the fact that it was affected during the tsunami, and cyclones,” a reliable source said.</p>
      <p>The source added that the Chief Minister has allotted land for all three proposed medical colleges.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Union Ministry approved six new medical colleges at a cost of ₹1,950 crore, taking the total number of government medical colleges to 30.</p>
