      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:57:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> 's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> suffered a terrible tragedy at age 26 when her younger brother was killed in a car accident.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn had loaned the car to her younger brother Burt, but wrote in her autobiography The Secrets Of My Life that she refuses to blame herself.</p>
      <p>She says she came to the realisation that it was Burt's "day to die".</p>
      <p>Caitlyn's brother died at the age of 18, just three months after she - then Bruce - won gold at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.</p>
      <p>In her book, Caitlyn explains that she and Burt had never been very close, mainly due to their eight-year age gap.</p>

      <p>But when Burt asked to move in with his brother and his then-wife Chrystie, Bruce saw a great opportunity to improve their relationship.</p>
      <p>Burt's bags were packed and lined up in his bedroom ready for a flight to California that he would tragically never make.</p>
      <p>It was on November 30, 1976, that Bruce was at a speaking engagement in Connecticut, where Burt was living with their parents.</p>
      <p>In her book, Caitlyn explains that Bruce was given a Porsche by a local car dealer while he was in town, and that he'd loaned it to Burt.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "I let Burt use it a little bit. For an eighteen-year-old kid who has just graduated from high school, few things in life, if anything, are sweeter than tooling around town in a Porsche 911. Burt is also responsible."</p>

      <p>Burt had planned to fill the car with gas and meet his brother to take it back to the dealer, and he can't resist driving past his old Canton High School.</p>
      <p>Burt drove by and saw a girl he knew standing out front, Judith Hitchings, who was 16, and tells her to jump in to go for a spin with him.</p>
      <p>It's only when three police officers walk into the room where Bruce is delivering a speech and asks to speak to him and his father that they know something is wrong.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn continues: "Burt has taken the Porsche on Old Canton Road. Because the road was old, it was narrow and curvy. There was a rise, and Burt took it too fast.</p>
      <p>"The Porsche went airborne and then crooked. It hit a tree and then a rock wall of sizable boulders. Hutchings was flung from the car and killed instantly. Burt suffered critical injuries."</p>

      <p>Burt's family was told by a surgeon that he could not live. He was put on life support, with machines keeping his breathing going and his heart beating, but there were no brain waves.</p>
      <p>His parents made the heartbreaking decision to take him off life support.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn writes: "I have struggled with the issue of guilt. What if I had never taken the car from the dealer? What if I had never lent it to Burt? Why did he pick up an innocent young woman who had her whole life in front of her? Why did he drive so carelessly?</p>
      <p>"But never in my life have I ever beat myself up about it. It is a mechanism of protection, I know, but I have come to the conclusion that it was Burt's day to die, just as, on the beaches of Normandy, it was my father's day not to. It was the way it was.</p>

      <p>"That's what happened. The accident had a fate and will of its own: two people tragically lost their lives, and my brother was the one responsible. But I have to move on because so much of my life has been about moving on - get over it, get through it, don't show outward emotion because it only leads to inner emotions, and I must keep those in check. The floodgates open and I am done."</p>
      <p>Bruce later named his first born son after Burt.</p>
