      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:34:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea fans want to see John Terry return to the club after the Aston Villa assistant scored a sublime volley in training.</p>
      <p>Terry still enjoys legendary status at Stamford Bridge having left Chelsea at the end of his contract to initially join <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> as a player in 2017.</p>
      <p>He made over 700 appearances for the club in a 22-year stint which began as a 14-year-old, winning the Premier League and FA Cup on five occasions and three League Cup as well as captaining them to Champions League and Europa League glory.</p>
      <p>Terry hung up his boots last year and returned to Villa last October as assistant head coach to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith,</a> who delivered promotion back to the top flight in May.</p>

      <p>Terry - known for his deadly poaching instinct at set-pieces - showed he still has it in training.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old volleyed in from distance when the ball sat up just right for him with the goalkeeper standing no chance.</p>
      <p>Predictably, Bodymoor Heath cameras caught the strike from all angles and Chelsea fans were quick to spot the clip and asked Terry to return to Stamford Bridge, reports the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/john-terry-signing-demanded-chelsea-20878140">Daily Star.</a>  </p>
      <p>One supporter said: “You’ve still got it, JT. When is [Frank] Lampard signing you?”</p>
      <p>Another commented: “Sign him up again.”</p>
      <p>“The comeback is on,” a third said.</p>
      <p>And another added: “Frank, sign him.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Under Terry's pal Lampard, Chelsea are third in the Premier League with 26 points from 12 games having won their last six on the bounce.</p>
