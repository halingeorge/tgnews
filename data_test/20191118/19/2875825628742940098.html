      <h2>Bill Roache's much-loved character Ken Barlow was suffering from a nasty cough ahead of Sinead Tinker's funeral - and he will be rushed to hospital with pneumonia</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:58:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Ken Barlow was suffering from a nasty cough in tonight's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> - but his condition is about to get a lot worse.</p>
      <p>The much-loved character, who recently celebrated his 80th birthday, started spluttering while getting ready for Sinead Tinker's funeral.</p>
      <p>Ken continued to feel unwell and stayed at home with Claudia instead of making an appearance at Sinead's wake.</p>
      <p>Worried Corrie viewers voiced their concerns for Ken's health - and we will soon discover he has been struck down with pneumonia.</p>
      <p>Ken will be rushed to hospital, in scenes that imitate real-life as actor Bill Roache was hospitalised with the killer disease just days before his 80th birthday in 2012.</p>

      <p>Ken first started coughing at the beginning of the episode, but told concerned Peter he was "fine".</p>
      <p>He started spluttering again while waiting for Daniel and Beth to arrive with Bertie before leaving for the funeral.</p>
      <p>When Claudia asked if he was sure he was fine, Ken nodded and whispered: "I'm alright."</p>

      <p>However, he could be heard coughing during the funeral, then Peter revealed his cold had got worse so Claudia was keeping an eye on him at home.</p>
      <p>Ken takes a drastic turn for the worse in future episodes when Peter tells Adam that Ken has been rushed to hospital.</p>
      <p>With the family all fearful - could this really be the end of the great Kenneth Barlow?</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , one concerned viewer said: "What's up with Ken? He's been coughing loads recently."</p>
      <p>"£10 says Ken will end up with a serious illness," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "How come no one noticed or cared that Ken is unwell?!</p>
      <p>"Please go and see a doctor Ken," said a fourth.</p>

      <p>Actor Bill spent a few days ­recovering at home after he was rushed to hospital with the killer disease following a speaking tour of Canada.</p>
      <p>A source close to Bill told The People: “Everyone was concerned for him but he’s such a battler and he never lets ­anything get a hold of him.</p>
      <p>“Pneumonia can be a killer for older people but Bill has always taken care of his health and well-being and that’s why he’s in such remarkable shape.</p>
      <p>“He’s planning a party to celebrate his 80th birthday and wild horses wouldn’t keep him away from that. He can’t wait to be with his family and friends.”</p>

      <p>At the time, a spokeswoman for Bill said the actor was on the mend at his house in Wilmslow, Cheshire.</p>
      <p>She said: “Bill is currently at home recovering from pneumonia. It isn’t ideal, especially with his 80th birthday coming up. But he is doing very well and feeling much better now.”</p>
