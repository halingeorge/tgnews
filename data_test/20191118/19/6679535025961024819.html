      <p>A special team headed by Additional Commissioner of Police C. Easwaramurthy on Monday interrogated three professors, whose names allegedly figured in the notes left by 19-year-old Fathima Latheef, the first year student who ended her life in her hostel room at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, 10 days ago.</p>
      <p>Initially, the Kotturpuram Police registered a case treating it as an unnatural death. However, three days later, the parents of victim slammed the police for shoddy investigation and requested the Chief Ministers of Kerala and Tamil Nadu to order a thorough probe and demanded justice for the death of their daughter.</p>
      <p>With notes downloaded from her mobile phone as evidence, the parents alleged that their daughter was driven to take the extreme decision due to harassment of faculty members.</p>
      <p>With protests mounting, the investigation was handed over to a special team of police personnel from Central Crime Branch (CCB) headed by Mr. Easwaramurthy.</p>
      <p>After recording the statement of her father Abdul Latheef on Saturday following his representation, the special team issued summons to the three professors, whose names figured in the notes left by the victim in her mobile phone.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the professors were interrogated in an undisclosed location in the city. All their statements were duly recorded and further investigation is on, said sources. The special team is likely to continue its investigation with a few more staff members and the roommates of the victim, sources said.</p>
      <p>It may be recalled that City Police Commissioner A.K.Viswanathan had promised expeditious investigation and quick action against those responsible for the girl’s death.</p>
