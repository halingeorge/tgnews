      <h1>Naturi Naughton Claps Back After Lil Kim Insulted Her Acting In New Video</h1>

      <p>While fans mostly know talented actress and singer Naturi Naughton for her role in Starz’ hit series, <i>Power</i>, but back in 2009, she took on the part of a lifetime — she played Lil Kim in a biopic about the late great rapper Notorious B.I.G., entitled <i>Notorious</i>.</p>
      <p>And by the looks of things, Lil Kim will make sure that she constantly reminds Naturi that she did not like the way she portrayed her.</p>
      <p>In a past interview, the petite rapper made sure to bash Naturi’s performance, and in a new interview with <i>Hollywood Unlocked</i>, the resentment and shading continued.</p>

      <p>Lil Kim said the following: “I’m gonna touch on this briefly because I think everybody already knows my answer to this, but I hated everything about that movie. I hated it. Wasn’t involved in it. I actually had to get my lawyers involved, which I ended up getting a check from it. That was the only reason I was [like] whatever.”</p>
      <p>Lili Kim did explain that reveals that she would love to see Lil Mama or Teyana Taylor to play her in an upcoming film.</p>

      <p>The reality TV star claimed: “When I do do the movie of my life, I’m going to go back to Brooklyn, and I will hold auditions until I find the perfect person. If that is Teyana [Taylor] or Lil Mama or whoever it is, it’s gotta be perfect.”</p>

      <p>She went on to say: “I was not okay with that!… I would have never picked her. Never, ever, ever. She has nothing in common with me. Nothing. No, seriously. I said it already, so I’m not gonna sit here and act like I didn’t say these things. I don’t like the way she’s been disrespectful about it. I wasn’t even like, basically blaming her, but she did like a whole documentary coming at me.”</p>

      <p>Lil Kim did have a few positive things to say about some of the female rappers in the game:<br/>“I like Cardi. City Girls is my girls,” she said. “I like…[Megan Thee Stallion] is killing it, that’s my girl. Dej Loaf. I think everybody forgets about her. That’s my friend. I call her my little Sade because she’s like, the female rap Sade. I always tell her that. She needs to run with that.”</p>
      <p>Lil Kim knows what she wants.</p>
