      <h1>Land pooling policy: DDA looking at areas in Bawana, Sultanpur Dabas</h1>
      <h2>‘Three sectors have accumulated 70% of contiguous land’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:59:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Shinjini-Ghosh-9147/" target="_blank">Shinjini Ghosh</a></address>
      <p>According to internal exercises carried out by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), certain sectors near Bawana and Sultanpur Dabas areas have accumulated 70% of contiguous land required for a particular sector to be developed under the land pooling policy.</p>
      <p>Under the policy, at least 70% contiguous land is required to be accumulated before it can be developed.</p>
      <p>Senior DDA officials said that the urban body has approached the Revenue Department of the Delhi government to appoint nodal officers to carry out verification of the applications.</p>
      <h3>Verification process</h3>
      <p>“Under internal exercises carried out by the DDA, Sectors 17, 20 and 21 of Zone N have qualified to be developed as there is 70% land accumulated. However, it will depend on the final verification to be carried out by the Delhi government. Once the verification also shows 70% contiguous accumulated land, the areas will be considered for development,” said a senior DDA official.</p>
      <p>The land-owning agency is also carrying out mapping exercises to verify other areas and sectors where 70% land has been accumulated.</p>
      <p>Under the land pooling policy, Delhi has been divided into five zones, which are then divided into smaller sectors. “To qualify a sector for development, a minimum of 70% contiguous land of the developable area within a sector, free of encumbrances, is required to be pooled,” the policy states.</p>
      <p>Once a particular sector accumulates the required amount of pooled land, the urban body will invite stakeholders to form a consortium for the development to take place, the official explained. “We are also planning to hold a meeting soon with the land owners and those who have applied under the policy to pool their respective land. They will be invited to form a consortium, which is a requisite before the development can start,” the official said.</p>
      <p>The land pooling policy, which has projected dwelling units for approximately 76 lakh people in the Capital, was approved by the Centre in October last year.</p>
