      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> has already made her mark on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> jungle, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-in-tears-as-shes-comforted-by-caitlyn-jenner-over-skydiving-challenge-11168416/">kicking off the series with a spectacular skydive</a> before being <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-2019-kate-garraway-another-nightmare-bushtucker-trial-caitlyn-jenner-11174977/">chosen for the first Bushtucker trial of the series.</a></p>
      <p>Clearly she’s struck a chord with viewers, however, as she’s already become one of the favourites to be crowned 2019 champion, with Ladbrokes offering odds of just 9/2 on the 70-year-old taking the title.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn was certainly a big signing for the ITV show, and it’s been reported that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/how-much-im-a-celebrity-contestants-paid-11170757/">she’s also nabbing herself a big pay packet</a> for taking part this year – but just how much is she being paid?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>How much is Caitlyn Jenner being paid for I’m A Celebrity?</h3>
      <p>According to reports Caitlyn is set to pocket a cool £500,000 for the privilege of fending off cockroaches in the jungle for three weeks – one of the biggest pay days the show has ever dished out.</p>

      <p>The former Olympic champion’s reported salary was the butt <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-ant-dec-make-digs-caitlyn-jenners-rumoured-500k-fee-11172629/">of one of Ant and Dec’s jokes as the series kicked off on Sunday night,</a> with Dec saying: ‘We’ve got reality TV royalty Caitlyn Jenner. Most people come into the jungle to lose a few pounds…’ before Ant added:‘But she’s going to be gaining 500,000 of them according to the papers.’</p>

      <p>Caitlyn – who has a pretty famous brood of children, including daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and four Kardashian step-children – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/caitlyn-jenner-confirmed-im-celebrity-2019-shock-signing-11028866/">was seen as a shock signing</a> when news of her joining the series broke earlier this month.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a real bolt from the blue. They’ve asked her every year for a long time, but she finally felt the time was right,’ a source told The Sun.</p>
      <h3>What other reality shows has Caitlyn Jenner appeared in?</h3>

      <p>Despite previously claiming she had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/caitlyn-jenner-no-idea-im-celeb-works-breaks-silence-appearance-11070114/">‘no idea’ how I’m A Celeb worked,</a> eagle-eyed fans know that Caitlyn is actually no stranger to the show format.</p>
      <p>That’s because <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/caitlyn-jenner-appeared-im-celebrity-us-despite-claiming-doesnt-know-show-works-11076568/">she took part in the US version of I’m A Celebrity,</a> in its first series back in 2003 – when she was still Bruce, years before she transitioned.</p>

      <p>On that occasion Bruce got to the final week of the series but didn’t make it as far as the final three.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has also previously appeared on Celebrity Apprentice in 2005 (once again as Bruce), and of course featured on Keeping Up With The Kardashians back in the days when she and Kris Jenner were still together.</p>
