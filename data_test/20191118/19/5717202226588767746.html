      <h1>Lucas Torreira’s agent’s latest comments will worry Arsenal fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:45:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>The agent of Lucas Torreira has confirmed the player is unsettled at Arsenal following recent speculation about his future.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan midfielder hasn’t been a regular starter for the Gunners this term, with competition coming in strong from the likes of Matteo Guendouzi, Dani Ceballo, Joe Willock and Granit Xhaka before his recent stripping of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>When he has played, Unai Emery has at times deployed him as an advanced midfielder which does not get the best out of the £26 million signing (<a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/bentancur-a-cm-milan-torreira-ecco-perche-non-e-andata-in-porto--25745">BBC Sport</a>).</p>

      <p>It was recently reported that Torreira was to seek out Emery for talks about his future (<a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/milan/?action=read&amp;idtmw=1312092">TMW</a>).</p>
      <p>And now, the player’s agent Pablo Bentancur has confirmed his client is indeed unsettled.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/bentancur-a-cm-milan-torreira-ecco-perche-non-e-andata-in-porto--25745">He told Calciomercato</a>: “I must say that the change of role has penalised him sharply.</p>
      <p>“He is no longer at ease and we hope that things can change.</p>

      <p>“We have no problem with Arsenal but only words of thanks. Arsenal has allowed Lucas to compete in the Premier League, he has always shown great confidence.</p>
      <p>Bentancur then stated that Torreira follows Italian football ‘with great interest’, which is bound to worry Gunners supporters after he previously admitted interest from AC Milan (<a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/torreira-arsenal-transfer-rumour-atletico-17276859">football.london</a>).</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Emery misuse could cost Arsenal a top player</h3>
      <p>Torreira has the potential to be a top player.</p>

      <p>He showed shortly after joining the club in 2018 how effective he can be, but out of nowhere Emery has started using him differently and infrequently.</p>
      <p>It is something that could well force Torreira to push for an exit, which would be a major shame given his potential.</p>
