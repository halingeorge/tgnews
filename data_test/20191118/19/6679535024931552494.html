      <h2>Panel orders payment of interim compensation of ₹25 lakh each to 15 more flat owners</h2>

      <p>Arrangements for providing medical and property insurance to residents living within 50 metres of the four flats to be demolished at Maradu will be made in a week.</p>
      <p>The decision was taken when Fort Kochi Sub Collector Snehil Kumar Singh, who is in charge of the demolition process, Thripunithura MLA M. Swaraj and Maradu municipality chairperson T.H. Nadeera met Minister for Local Self Government A.C. Moideen with the concerns of the residents in the vicinity of the flats, on Sunday in Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
      <p>The insurance agencies will be finalised soon. A suggestion was made that temporary accommodation facilities could be arranged for willing residents in the vicinity till the demolition was complete, and rent could be footed by the State government, said Mr. Swaraj.</p>
      <p>Taller metal sheets will be raised around the buildings, which are now covered only partially, and water will be sprayed regularly to reduce pollution from dust.</p>
      <p>Residents living around Alfa Serene, one of the flats to be demolished, had raised complaints when parts of the swimming pool were destroyed two weeks ago, said Ms. Nadeera. The area around Alfa Serene was the most populated, with around 50 families, an orphanage and a few shops in the vicinity, she added.</p>
      <p>The area is still being surveyed to identify those who are likely to be affected by the demolition.</p>
      <h3>Compensation</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the K. Balakrishnan Nair committee on Monday ordered payment of interim compensation of ₹25 lakh each to 15 flat owners, taking the total number of flat owners who will receive compensation to 246.</p>
      <p>Two other petitions were adjourned after asking the petitioners to furnish more details to sustain their claim for interim compensation. Of the 286 flat owners who could apply for compensation, a total of 274 claim petitions were received before the deadline and sanction for 22 petitions is still pending.</p>
