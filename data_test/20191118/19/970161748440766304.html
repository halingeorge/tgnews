      <p>A Conservative General Election candidate has come under fire after claiming British Jews return from trips to Israel as ‘brainwashed extremists’.</p>
      <p>Amjad Bashir has apologised for his comments, which resurfaced this week after being made in a speech to the European parliament when he was a Ukip MEP in 2014.</p>
      <p>However, his party agent Dan Cohen has reportedly claimed he will not campaign for him in Leeds North East, where there is a large Jewish community, and is demanding an inquiry into the incident.</p>
      <p>In a speech delivered to the European Parliament in Brussels, Amjad Bashir said: ‘As far as brainwashing by the rabbis and the politicians are concerned – I can testify to that.</p>
      <p>‘Young men are going over from England where I come from – people of the Jewish faith who my grandchildren have grown up with as decent young men.</p>

      <p>‘But have come back as extremists – as people that are brainwashed.</p>
      <p>‘They will not listen to reason. There is something very peculiar and wrong going on in Israel.’</p>

      <p>Mr Bashir was confirmed as the Tory candidate to fight the December 12 election last week and is trying to unseat Labour’s Fabian Hamilton.</p>
      <p>The restaurateur defected from the Conservatives to Ukip in 2012, before returning in 2015.</p>
      <p>His speech sparked outrage from Lib Dem Leeds North East candidate Jon Hannah who wrote on Twitter: ‘Is it just me or have the Tories lost the plot?</p>
      <p>‘Putting an ex-UKIP MEP who talks publicly about how the ‘Israeli State brainwashes English Jews’ up as a candidate in Leeds North East?</p>
      <p>‘Repellant anti-semitism. It seems it isn’t just Labour with a problem.’</p>
      <p>Sam de Kare-Silver added: ‘Conservatives need to act quick and remove Amjad Bashir for his repellent comments on Jews and Israel.’</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Monday, Mr Bashir told the <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/tory-election-candidate-for-leeds-north-east-claims-british-jews-return-from-israel-as-brainwashed-extremists-1.493217">Jewish Chronicle</a>: ‘I deeply regret the comments I made around brainwashing – this was borne from a personal experience but it was completely wrong and I apologise unreservedly for it.</p>
      <p>‘I have always been a strong advocate of a two state solution between Israel and Palestine so we can finally put an end to this conflict and the bloodshed and pain it has caused on both sides.</p>

      <p>‘Having visited Gaza in the past, I did speak with a degree of emotion about the humanitarian situation I witnessed there, and frustration about the lack of progress towards establishing a lasting peace for the benefit of both Israel and Palestine, but I accept the tone I took has caused alarm and distress within the Jewish community, for which I apologise.’</p>
      <p>‘I continue to believe that the only hope for lasting peace for both Israel and Palestine is constructive dialogue and I will continue to work with both communities to do whatever I can to help achieve that, in particular our strong Jewish community in Leeds North East.’</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk has contacted Mr Bashir and Mr Cohen for comment.</p>
