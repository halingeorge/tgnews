      <p>The UN's Libya envoy pleaded with foreign actors to honor an arms embargo on the conflict-torn country as he said an attack on a Tripoli factory Monday may amount to a war crime.</p>
      <p>Ghassan Salame accused unnamed countries of worsening the violence in Libya in a strongly worded address via video link to the United Nations Security Council in New York.</p>
      <p>He said "external parties" were operating drone strikes that are increasing civilian casualties, adding that the growing use of experienced mercenaries was intensifying the conflict.</p>
      <p>"The dangers and direct consequences of foreign interference are increasingly evident," said Salame, warning of a "race against time" to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>
      <p>Salame called for external actors to adhere to a UN arms embargo imposed on Libya since 2011.</p>
      <p>He did not mention any names but a confidential report seen by AFP earlier this month found that Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have regularly violated the embargo.</p>
      <p>The year-long study found that the three countries "routinely and sometimes blatantly supplied weapons with little effort to disguise the source."</p>
      <p>According to diplomats, Jordan was accused of having trained troops of Khalifa Haftar, a military strongman in eastern Libya who launched an offensive in April in a bid to seize Tripoli from fighters loyal to the Government of National Accord (GNA).</p>
      <p>The United Arab Emirates -- another Haftar backer -- is suspected of using attack aircraft on behalf of his Libyan National Army (LNA) forces.</p>
      <p>The UAE is suspected of involvement in a July 2 bombing of a detention center for migrants in a Tripoli suburb which left around 50 people dead.</p>
      <p>Salame said in his briefing that LNA forces were increasingly using unguided bombs in airstrikes on populated areas of Tripoli.</p>
      <p>"It is our judgement that the drone infrastructure and operations are facilitated by external parties to the conflict," he added, without naming names.</p>
      <p>Salame said an attack on a biscuit factory in southern Tripoli Monday had killed 10 people and "may constitute a war crime."</p>
      <p>Libya has been mired in chaos since a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.</p>
      <p>The battle for Tripoli, which has come to a standstill on the ground after initial advances by Haftar's forces, has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced about 120,000 others, according to the UN.</p>
      <p>Haftar is backed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE, while Turkey and Qatar back his rival, the United Nations-recognized GNA.</p>
