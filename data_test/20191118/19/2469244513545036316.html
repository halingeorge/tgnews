      <h2>It certainly turned heads at Exeter's High Street Christmas Lights switch-on: But what is the legendary comedian's Exeter link?</h2>

      <p>A gigantic puppet of the late comedian Tommy Cooper stunned crowds at Exeter's Christmas lights switch on Saturday (November 16).</p>
      <p>And many among the thousands who attended the High Street event will have asked: "Who?" and "Why?!"</p>
      <p>The eerily accurate puppet, held aloft by a volunteer, represented the legendary fez-topped comedian's childhood in the Devon capital.</p>
      <p>Tommy Cooper, who towered six foot five inches tall, became an icon of light entertainment from the late 1940s until his death on stage in 1984.</p>
      <p>Welsh-born Tommy moved to Exeter when he was just three years old and spent the rest of his childhood there and, with some help from his Crediton-born mum, picked up the Westcountry accent he is so well known for.</p>

      <p>He lived in his family home at 3 Fords Road, off Willeys Avenue, and attended Comrie House Prep School on that road before he moved to Mount Radford School for Boys at St Leonards Road.</p>
      <p>His parents ran several businesses in the city including an ice cream van. It was eight years old he was given a magic set and the rest, they always say, is history.</p>
      <p>In a sad twist, Cooper's father was fond of gambling and the Fords Road house was sold and the family moved on to Langley, a village near Southampton, in 1930.</p>

      <p>There was indeed a plaque at 3 Fords Road for many years marking the childhood home of the comic, paid for by Jimmy Tarbuck.</p>
      <p>When it was removed for a spruce-up, it was broken and has not been replaced since.</p>
      <p>The plaque read: "Entertainer Tommy Cooper lived here 1925-1930."</p>
