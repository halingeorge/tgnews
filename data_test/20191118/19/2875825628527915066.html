      <h2>The Manchester United stopper has been fighting for the No.1 spot, but Spain boss Robert Moreno has made clear his preference for Kepa Arrizabalaga</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:37:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/david-de-gea">David de Gea</a> has again been snubbed by Spain boss Robert Moreno, as La Roja close their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper has been second choice under Moreno, since he replaced Luis Enrique, having previously been first choice since ousting Iker Casillas towards the end of the Vicente del Bosque era.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> stopper Kepa Arrizabalaga has been preferred throughout 2019, leaving De Gea to start start just two of his country’s last nine matches.</p>
      <p>On Friday night, Roma’s Pau Lopez was given the nod to start in the 7-0 thrashing of Malta.</p>
      <p>And on Monday evening, for the meeting with Romania, the 29 year-old was once more overlooked, with Kepa back between the sticks.</p>

      <p>Moreno has stated on a number of occasions that all three goalkeepers are vying for the No.1 spot, and that there is no outright favourite.</p>
      <p>Back in September he declared: "I don't have a starting goalkeeper. It may or may not change.</p>
      <p>"I keep the same message. All three are of the top level and I really want them to make my decision difficult.</p>
      <p>"The three have trained at a very high level. I will not say if one is my preferred goalkeeper or not.”</p>

      <p>But Kepa has been the former assistant manager’s selection in six of his nine games.</p>
      <p>And after being selected at the Wanda Metropolitano - where De Gea's former club, Atletico Madrid, play their home matches - on Monday, the world’s most expensive goalkeeper is out in front to be No.1 at next summer’s European Championship Finals.</p>
      <p>There are questions over whether Moreno will be in charge of the 2008 and 2012 winners' next summer however, amid reports he could move aside and allow Luis Enrique to return.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.cope.es/deportes/futbol/futbol-seleccion/noticias/robert-moreno-sentara-banquillo-seleccion-eurocopa-luis-enrique-muy-cerca-volver-20191118_554273">Cope</a> reports that the Spanish Football Federation have already contacted former boss Enrique over a potential return at next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> coach stood down earlier this year to focus on his family, after discovering his daughter Xana was suffering from bone cancer.</p>
      <p>Enrique kept his daughter's illness quiet until August, when the family <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/luis-enrique-announces-heartbreaking-news-19034216">announced that she had died at the age of nine.</a></p>
      <p>Moreno announced in September that he would happily step aside for Enrique to return to his post, should he be keen on a second spell, stating" "If one day he wants to return, I would be delighted to take a step to the side and work with him."</p>
