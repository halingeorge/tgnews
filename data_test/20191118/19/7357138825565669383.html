      <h1>Grab Expands Into Japan And Middle East</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:25:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Grab has announced that it’s expanding so users of the ride-hailing service in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines will be able to book rides when they visit Japan and 13 Middle East countries, according to <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/grab-japan-taxi-careem-163079/">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The services will be available in the users’ main language and they can use GrabPay Credits.</p>
      <p>Grab partnered with JapanTaxi in Japan, where users can find rides in Okinawa, Sapporo, Kyoto, Nagoya and Tokyo. JapanTaxi has a fleet of 70,000 vehicles.</p>
      <p>In the Middle East, Grab partnered with Careem, and customers can find rides in 94 cities throughout several countries including: Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Iraq, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco and Turkey.</p>
      <p>Careem, which has more than 1 million drivers, was acquired by Uber for about $3 billion. </p>
      <p>Grab said the new service is being rolled out in partnership with Splyt in order to give travelers “convenient access to ride-hailing services around the world.”</p>
      <p>Splyt is based in London and operates as a B2B mobility marketplace. Leveraging Grab and Splyt tech, users can already use Grab in 336 cities in numerous Southeast Asian markets using AliPay and Ctrip, among other payment methods. </p>
      <p>Grab was a participant in a Series A funding round for Splyt, worth $8 million. Splyt recently partnered with Booking Holdings to combine ride-hailing into online travel sites. People who use Booking.com will soon be able to use Grab’s services directly in the platform. Grab said the service will be available by Q3. </p>
      <p>“Our partnership with Splyt further expands our travel program, designed to make travelling in and out of Southeast Asia that much more rewarding and seamless,” Grab said.</p>
      <p>Although Grab continues to expand, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Anthony Tan said the company is not going to launch an initial public offering (IPO) <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/south-east-asia/2019/grab-ceo-no-ipo-until-business-shows-profits/">until it turns a profit</a>.</p>
      <p>Tan said he anticipates additional markets will turn a profit in the next 12 months and some are already making money.</p>
      <p>“Once we’re profitable, then we can clearly go to public when we want to,” Tan said.</p>
