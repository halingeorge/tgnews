      <p>Earnings for European football company <b>Manchester United’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/manu-stock-quote/"><b><u>MANU</u></b></a>) <a href="https://ir.manutd.com/press-releases.aspx">fiscal first quarter of 2020</a> sent its stock up more than 1% on Monday. Much of the jump comes from its adjusted earnings per share of 3 pence. That’s much better than Wall Street’s estimate of a 4-pence-per-share loss. Although revenue of £135.4 million is below analysts’ estimates, MANU stock still isn’t in the red.</p>

      <p>Ed Woodward, Executive Vice Chairman of Manchester United, has this to say about the MANU stock earnings.</p>
      <blockquote>“We are very proud to be shortly approaching a milestone 4,000th game featuring an Academy player, and we are particularly optimistic regarding the considerable young talent currently coming through. Our ultimate goal is to win trophies by playing exciting football with a team that fuses graduates from our Academy with world-class acquisitions.”</blockquote>
