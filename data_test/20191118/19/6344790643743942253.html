      <h1>HELLBOY: THE CROOKED MAN is Getting a Sequel Story Called THE RETURN OF EFFIE KOLB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy Williams</a></address>
      <p>The iconic <b><i>Hellboy</i></b> story “The Crooked Man” is getting a sequel. Dark Horse recently revealed that <b>Mike Mignola</b> is teaming up with artist <b>Zach Howard</b>, colorist <b>Dave Stewart</b>, and letterer <b>Clem Robbins</b> to create <b><i>Hellboy &amp; The B.P.R.D.: The Return of Effie Kolb</i></b>. Mignola talked about creating the sequel over 10 years later in the following statement:</p>
      <blockquote>Sometimes you create a character, they perform their function, and that’s it. Other times you finish with them and they just refuse to get back in their box. Tom Ferrell is one of those characters. Even as I was writing The Crooked Man I knew there was a whole lot more to that guy. And Effie Kolb… It turns out there are worse things you can do to a character than turn them into a horse.</blockquote>
      <p>Howard added:</p>
      <blockquote>Getting to stand in the shadows of the two legends that made The Crooked Man is an honor. Mignola asking me to draw the sequel is an opportunity I have not taken likely, and I’ve given my absolute best to live up to his wonderful creation. This will be my final sequential art as a freelance comic book artist, and I couldn’t ask for a better end to this chapter of my career.</blockquote>
      <p><i>The Return of Effie Kolb</i> will run for two issues with the first half debuting on February 19, 2020. You can check out the cover art for the first issue below.</p>
