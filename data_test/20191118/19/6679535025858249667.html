      <p>Despite the changing dynamics of media, newspapers and media houses should not lose their focus from upholding the core values of journalism, said the chairman of Alva’s Education Foundation Mohan Alva here on Monday.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the National Press Day organised by the Dakshina Kannada Working Journalists’ Union here, Mr. Alva said with corporatisation and changes in business dynamics, there were some changes that media houses cannot resist. “But this should not prevent media houses from experimentation. There should be honest efforts to uphold the core values of journalism,” he said. Youngsters, who enter the field with great enthusiasm, are bound to make mistakes. Media houses should take care that reports do not harm the social fabric of society, he added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Alva said its not only journalists but other professionals, including artistes and doctors, are facing challenges in upholding their core values. “With the audience getting corrupted, we (artistes) are finding it challenging to present cultural programmes,” he said.</p>
      <p>The president of Indian Federation of Working Journalists B.N. Mallikarjunaiah said journalists should continue to uphold the truth. “There are loopholes in democracy. It is the duty of journalists to uphold the truth. Journalists should be committed to their profession,” he said and referred to life of writer and veteran journalist D.V. Gundappa.</p>
      <p>Following the inaugural function, there was reorientation session for postgraduate journalism students conducted by Bhaskar Hegde, HoD, Journalism, SDM College, Ujire. B.V. Vivek Rai, writer and former Vice-Chancellor of Kannada University, Hampi, presided over the session.</p>
