      <p><b>GATINEAU, Quebec (AP)</b> - A union federation representing 45,000 teachers in Quebec is suing the Canadian province over its ban on the wearing of religious symbols by many public employees.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit by the Fédération Autonome de l'Enseignement challenges a state secularism law passed this year that prohibits some civil servants from wearing symbols of religion, such as hijabs and crosses, while at work.</p>
      <p>The most contentious rule is that any new police officers, judges, lawyers and teachers are banned completely from wearing any religious symbols while on duty. Existing employees get an exception.</p>
      <p>A student studying to become a teacher and Montreal's English school board are among those who have also filed lawsuits.</p>
      <p>Nour Farhat, who wears a hijab and studied law to become a prosecutor, is among those affected by the law.</p>
