      <p>Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy inaugurated a three-day regional-level science exhibition for school students at the Jeevanantham Government Higher Secondary School on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister, who was accompanied by Education Minister Kamalakannan and MLA John Kumar, surveyed the exhibits displayed by the students and also interacted with them on various models.</p>
      <p>P. T. Rudra Goud, Director of School Education, school principals/headmasters and staff were present.</p>
      <p>Students showcased a range of exhibits — from solar-powered car to an excavator model to rescue persons trapped deep in borewells.</p>
      <p>The exhibition featured 340 scientific models developed by teams involving over a thousand students. The expo is also attracting a large number of visitors, including schoolchildren.</p>
      <p>The annual science exhibition to select ‘youth scientists’ from across the Union Territory is held as a two stage competition — regional and State level.</p>
      <p>The winners at the regional-level will compete at the State-level contest along with winners of the regional rounds in Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam.</p>
      <p>The State-level science exhibition will get under way at the same venue on November 21.</p>
