      <p>(CNN) - Ford unveiled its all-electric Ford Mustang Mach-E crossover SUV on Sunday, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent out a congratulatory tweet following the announcement.</p>
      <p>"Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too," Musk wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The new Mustang appears to be an attempt by Ford to take on Tesla, and it will directly compete with the upcoming Tesla Model Y SUV.</p>
      <p>"Thanks, Elon," <a href="https://twitter.com/Ford/status/1196299471308476418">Ford tweeted in response to Musk</a>. "We couldn't agree more. See you at the charging station!"</p>
      <p>Tesla already has an all-electric SUV in the luxury Model X, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/business/tesla-model-y-elon-musk/index.html">Musk has already admitted</a> that it is of minor importance and does not have a huge impact on the company's bottom line. The more affordable Model Y, on the other hand, has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/business/tesla-model-y-elon-musk/index.html">the potential to be a game-changer for Tesla</a> with the popularity of crossover SUVs.</p>
      <p>With production on the Model Y slated to begin in the summer of 2020, Tesla may have a small head start on Ford, as the Mustang Mach-E is expected to be available next fall.</p>
      <p>The Model Y is also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/business/tesla-model-y-elon-musk/index.html">expected to have a starting price under $40,000</a>, while the basic version of the Ford Mustang Mach-E will begin at around $45,000.</p>
