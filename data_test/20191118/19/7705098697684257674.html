      <h1>Florence Pugh Says Black Widow Movie Was ‘Nuts’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:35:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Next year, Florence Pugh is joining the MCU in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/black-widow"><b>Black Widow</b></a>. Pugh, fresh from her leading role in <b>Midsommar</b>, recently appeared on <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/actors/actors-on-actors-beanie-feldstein-florence-pugh-1203406726/">Variety’s “Actors On Actors” series</a>. She spoke with <b>Booksmart</b>’s Beanie Feldstein about her work on the Marvel. And she had an interesting description about its filming.</p>
      <p>“It was one of the most bizarre, nuts, extravaganza experiences,” explained Pugh. She noted that filming took place in Budapest, Morocco and Atlanta, and just wrapped about three weeks ago. But she had nothing but praise for co-star Scarlett Johannson and the film’s director, Cate Shortland.</p>
      <p>“The fact that I got to do one of those films with a lead actress and the most beautiful and warm director was a very, very unique and special experience,” said Pugh. “I don’t know what the other films are like and working on them, but I remember being on set many times and thinking, ‘I know this isn’t like this, I know this is unique and I have to take it all in.’”</p>

      <p>Additionally, Pugh touched upon the tone of <b>Black Widow</b>.</p>
      <p>“I think we’ve made something very raw and very painful and very beautiful,” added Pugh. “And I think people are going to be really surprised by the outcome of a big action film having that much heart. And I know lots of people will be emotional about her because her character had such a hard ending [in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/infinity-war"><b>Infinity War</b></a>], but it was special learning from her, and she’s been doing this for like 10 years in those films. For this to be her film was special. And I got to be there and see how she does stunts and lives it, and it’s so her.”</p>
      <p><b>Black Widow</b> arrives in theaters on May 1, 2020.</p>
