      <p>Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V. Muraleedharan has written to Union Minister for Human Resources Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank to look into the suicide of Fathima Latheef.</p>
      <p>In his letter, Mr. Muraleedharan said that he had spoken to Fathima’s parents who alleged that the reason for her suicide was mental harassment that she experienced at the hands of an Associate Professor in the Department of Humanities at IIT-Madras.</p>
      <p>“Although investigations are under way, I request you for an immediate probe into the case to unearth the mystery related to the incident. The people who are responsible for her death must be punished. Let the truth come out at the earliest,” he said.</p>
