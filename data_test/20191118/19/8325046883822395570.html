      <p>Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, is facing criticism for posing at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin, Germany, in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSW9plJBkZQ/">a 2017 Instagram photo</a> that resurfaced over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Chasten Buttigieg posted the photo of his husband walking through the memorial with the caption “This guy” in April 2017.</p>
      <p>The visually arresting memorial, which features rows of large stone blocks, is a major tourist attraction in Berlin and has been the location of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/berlins-holocaust-memorial-is-not-a-place-for-fun-selfies/2017/01/27/2e5b6324-e1ac-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html">much controversial behavior</a>, including social-media posts and selfies, since it opened to the public in 2005.</p>
      <p>Many Jewish advocates and others have condemned those who use the Holocaust memorial as a photo opportunity. Shahak Shapira, an Israeli comedian living in Germany, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/berlins-holocaust-memorial-is-not-a-place-for-fun-selfies/2017/01/27/2e5b6324-e1ac-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html">started a campaign</a> in recent years to shame those who take selfies there.</p>
      <p>Reporters and critics on both the right and the left called the photo insensitive and inappropriate as it made the rounds online.</p>
