      <p>Two 13-year-old boys confessed to holding a 15-year-old girl down and raping her on camera, police said.</p>
      <p>The two boys, who the victim reportedly regarded as friends, pinned her down and sexually assaulted her in a home in Clarksville, Tennessee in October.</p>
      <p>The victim and her parents have since spoken out after the two boys were given incredibly lenient sentences when they were found guilty of raping the teen.</p>
      <p>Because of Tennessee juvenile sentencing laws, one of the boys was ordered to serve only six months of probation. The other boy was sentenced to spend six months in juvenile detention because he allegedly has a criminal past.</p>
      <p>Neither of the boys will have to register as sex offenders because they are younger than 14, according to <a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/two-13-year-olds-convicted-of-raping-tennessee-teen-only-get-6-months-probation">WZTV</a>.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t really know what I’m comfortable saying…I got raped,’ the girl said. Neither the victim or her parents were named to protect the girl’s identity.</p>
      <p>The girl’s mother said she knew kids were often nasty to each other, but she never thought her daughter would be a victim of such a horrific crime.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I just always thought it would be, you know, kids being mean, teasing or fighting, but not rape.’</p>
      <p>The family said they immediately went to the police to report the crime.</p>
      <p>‘The only thing I really recall the police saying to me was essentially begging me to let them handle it,’ the victim’s father said.</p>
      <p>Jason Hodges, a Tennessee state representative, said he is now pushing to change the <a href="https://publications.tnsosfiles.com/acts/110/pub/pc1052.pdf">Juvenile Reform Act</a>, which set the guidelines for the boy’s light sentences.</p>
      <p>Hodges said: ‘Obviously as a father, I was disgusted and as a citizen of that community I was disgusted.’</p>
      <p>‘You know rape is obviously a serious offense and whether you’re 13 or 30, you should know better,’ he continued, and added that the new legislation he is supporting would allow convicted rapists 13-years-old and younger to be charged as adults.</p>
