      <p>R.Rajagopal, Additional Chief Secretary attached to the Raj Bhavan, has been appointed the State Chief Information Commissioner (CIC).</p>
      <p>He was one among five candidates who were considered by the selection committee, headed by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, at its meeting on Monday morning. The other prominent candidate on the shortlist was T.K. Rajendran, former Director General of Police (DGP), according to a source.</p>
      <p>An order announcing Mr. Rajagopal’s appointment was issued by Personnel and Administrative Reforms Secretary S. Swarna in the evening. The post of CIC had remained vacant since M. Sheela Priya demitted the office in May this year after she turned 65.</p>
      <p>In its edition dated November 16, The Hindu mentioned in a report that Mr. Rajapgopal was one among those whose names were doing the rounds for the CIC’s post.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rajagopal, who belongs to the 1984 batch of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers, is the first serving government officer to be made CIC.</p>
      <p>All of his predecessors — S. Ramakrishnan (2005-10), K.S. Sripathi (2010-15), K. Ramanujam (2015-17) and Dr. Sheela Priya (2017-19) — held the post after their retirement from government service.</p>
      <p>Barring Mr. Ramanujam, who is a former DGP, all others were retired IAS officers. According to the order, Mr. Rajagopal, who turned 58 in June this year, will hold the post for a period of three years.</p>
      <p>Through another order of the State government, Anandrao Vishnu Patil, who is now Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board, has been posted to the Raj Bhavan as Secretary to Governor Banwarilal Purohit.</p>
