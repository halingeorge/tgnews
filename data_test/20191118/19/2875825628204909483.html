      <p>"However, I have always noted the draw to play abroad one day, and I’m not talking this decision lightly, I have decided on what’s best for my family.</p>
      <p>“With my partner Elvira and two young children Jacob and Sofia, we are planning for our future and this is the right time for us to make the move.</p>
      <p>“As much as I will miss everything about this place – the players, staff, supporters and friends for life – I know there are many more special nights in Thomond Park and Irish Independent Park to be had.</p>
      <p>“I will continue to enjoy wearing my jersey with pride and will give my all in making sure Munster are a success this season.”</p>
