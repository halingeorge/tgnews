      <p>The morning and evening walkers frequenting to VMRDA Health Arena will be able to work out with the fitness equipment soon as the authorities have decided to set up an open gymnasium on the premises. In the first phase, 10 fitness stations have been sanctioned and the installation work is under way.</p>
      <p>The activities at the Health Arena is now confined to either walking or cycling or practising yoga. It is known for its walking and cycling trek extending up to 3.7 km.</p>
      <p>The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) was flooded with representations seeking open gymnasium at the Health Arena. However, there was technical issues involved as the park is under the administrative control of the VMRDA. Apart from Health Arena Walkers’ Association (HAWA), the residents living in the vicinity also represented to the civic authorities to install the equipment.</p>
      <p>“On our request, Visakha East MLA V.R.K. Babu took up the matter with the authorities. We are thankful to the GVMC and the VMRDA for making our dream come true,” HAWA honorary president Dr. Peda Somulu told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <h3>Heavy footfall</h3>
      <p>The Health Arena registers a footfall of 3,000 to 4,000 daily, which goes up to 8,000 on the weekend. “Many can not afford going to gymnasiums. The decision will be beneficial to the citizens who like to stretch out for a while after morning and evening walk,” he said.</p>
      <p>The GVMC set up an open gymnasium on Beach Road on an experimental basis in 2017, emulating the success story of New Delhi. Then it started receiving many representations from denizens and residents’ welfare associations to set up such facilities in their respective localities.</p>
      <h3>13 gyms on the cards</h3>
      <p>“We have already spent ₹5 crore on installation of fitness equipment in 62 locations in the city and 13 more such facilities are coming up in Gajuwaka area,” a GVMC official said. The civic body is engaging two firms from Maharashtra for supply and installation of equipment with one year warranty and four years of maintenance.</p>
