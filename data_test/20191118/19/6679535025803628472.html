      <p>The November 20 token strike and the indefinite strike from November 22 called by the Kerala State Bus Operators Coordination Committee raising various demands, including a hike in bus fare and revision in students concession, have been deferred following talks with Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran.</p>
      <p>The committee decided to defer the agitation after the Minister gave an assurance that ‘talks will continue’ at a meeting with representatives of four private bus operator unions at his office on Monday. It was also decided to hold the next round of meeting in the first week of December.</p>
      <p>At the meeting, the operators sought a minimum charge of ₹10, 80 paise for a km, fixing the minimum charge travel distance at 2.5 km, raising the minimum charge for students of government and aided institutions to ₹5, and revising the student concession as 50%.</p>
      <p>The operators also demanded that the student concession be made the same in both Kerala State Road Transport Corporation and private buses. Their another demand is withdrawal of students concession to those in private institutions. The increase in the cost of operations due to the increase in diesel and spare parts prices in the last 18 months was also taken up.</p>
      <p>Principal Secretary, Transport, K.R. Jyothilal, State Transport Commissioner-in-charge Rajeev Puthalath, and office-bearers of the Bus Operators Federation, Bus Operators Coordination Committee, All Kerala Bus Owners Union, and Kerala Bus Transport Association attended the talks.</p>
