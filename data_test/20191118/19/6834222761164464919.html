      <p>A victory and a triple crown. Marc Marquez wanted to end this 2019 in style without taking prisoners. He had his hand in things again in Valencia, during a Sunday where Fabio Quartararo was back on the podium with Jack Miller. Instead, Valentino Rossi had a bitter taste in his mouth, the protagonist in a dull GP where Jorge Lorenzo bade farewell to racing.</p>
      <p>This is what happened in the last race of the season, according to the watchful eye of our <b>Carlo Pernat.</b></p>
      <p>
        <i>"What can we say after this last Grand Prix? Marquez won, psychologically, with continuous motivations. I'm think of when he denied the third seasonal victory to Vinales or showed Quartararo that he was King. <b>It's like it was with Biaggi, when I told him to create motivations, and try to always have an enemy even when he was first.</b> In the end, the stimulus is what allows you to be a phenomenon. Marquez aside, there's always Ducati's weakness when it comes to riders, since choosing Petrucci was not a positive thing. Dovizioso has no internal stimulus, like when Jorge was around. I think Ducati is thinking of pairing Miller with Dovi and putting Danilo in Pramac. This could restore some vitality to the team. <b>We then witnessed a tug of war in Valencia between Dorna and Marquez. </b>The Organizer had promised Zarco a bike in the MotoGP in 2020, given Lorenzo's retirement, while Marc insisted on having his brother with him. In the end, Marquez won<b>, keeping the entire World Championship under his control, as Valentino once did with Lorenzo</b>. <b>These phenomena can also hold the decisive power in their hands</b>. Looking towards the future, I believe that there's a tug of war at Yamaha too. <b>Vale's decision on whether to stop or not, puts the team in great difficulty</b>, so, they're called to decide who to keep for the future. It's quite clear that Ducati is looking for riders, and it's 90% certain that Vinales should be signing on in March, even before Rossi reaches a decision. We can conclude with Marquez, since Marc made a difference this season. <b>When renewing his contract with Honda, Marc requested a bike for his brother. A sort of contractual exchange</b>. If it were for me, I wouldn't have put Alex Marquez in Honda."</i>
