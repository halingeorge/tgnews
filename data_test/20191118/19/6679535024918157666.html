      <p>The revenue collection at Sabarimala registered a handsome rise on the first day of the 41-day Mandalam pilgrim season on Sunday, compared to that of the previous year.</p>
      <p>Travancore Devaswom Board president N.Vasu told <i>The Hindu </i>on Monday that the revenue on Sunday was ₹3,32,55,986 against ₹2,04,23,533 received on the first day of the pilgrim season in 2018. Aravana and Appam sales fetched ₹1,33,48,160, which was ₹78,27,785 last year.</p>
      <p>The ‘kaanikka’ (offerings) made by devotees on Sunday was ₹1,00,10,900 against ₹75,88,950 last year. He said Sabarimala was witnessing a smooth pilgrimage.</p>
      <h3>Annadanam</h3>
      <p>The Travancore Devaswom Board chief said the board had made arrangements to feed not less than 40,000 people a day at its Annadana Mandapam at Sabarimala. Jaggery supply by the agency in Maharashtra for Appam-Aravana at Sabarimala was partially hit owing to incessant rain there over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>However, the TDB had made alternative arrangements to procure jaggery from the State itself, Mr. Vasu said.</p>
