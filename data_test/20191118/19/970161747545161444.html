        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a> let out her inner fierce as she appeared on Strictly: It Takes Two with dance partner Giovanni Pernice to discuss her elimination.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The RuPaul’s Drag Race star couldn’t help but return to her usual straight forward comments as she defended her last dance – which was to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/madonna/">Madonna</a>’s Vogue – on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rylan-clark/">Rylan Clark-Neal</a>, she explained: ‘It was a love letter to my LGBTQIA+ community, which is why I did it.</p>
      <p>‘I wanted to shed light on a community that doesn’t get enough attention. Especially this dance, in particular, that is a street dance.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a lot of controversy online saying it’s not dancing it’s posing and walking and arm-ography. No. Just because you don’t understand it doesn’t mean it’s not a dance.’</p>

      <p>Tell ’em, Michelle.</p>
      <p>The Drag Race judge couldn’t help but tear up at the thought of no longer competing, and we feel for her.</p>

      <p>It’s a good thing Michelle wore glasses bigger than her entire face.</p>
      <p>She also had the time of day to teach the haters about vogueing.</p>
      <p>‘This was not about a dance,’ she continued. ‘This was about a statement, it was about “love is greater than hate”. This is so much more than just a dance and it’s such a beautiful dance.</p>
      <p>‘It just meant so much to be able to do this on a platform like Strictly to shine a light on people who never get the attention they deserve and do it with sass and do it with class and do it with a fierceness.</p>

      <p>‘But don’t judge it before you know it.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, fans were just as devastated about the elimination as Michelle, complimenting her for speaking out for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: ‘Michelle making the LGBTQ+ community proud. This is how you uplift people selflessly.</p>
      <p>‘To see yourself represented on mainstream TV means so much for so many and she made sure our voices were heard.’</p>

      <p>‘V emotional watching @michellevisage on #ittakestwo,’ another fan tweeted. ‘Real Queens lift others up, they aren’t afraid to be a voice for those who’ve been silenced or who aren’t in the mainstream.</p>
      <p>‘They take risks and put others before themselves. If I can approach life like her then I’m doing ok’, along with a rainbow emoji.</p>
