        <b>A video out of Norway shows Muslims vaulting fences to try to attack an anti-Islam activist who burned a Koran.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident took place in Oslo on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A group called ‘Stop Islamization of Norway’ held a demonstration and were faced by a counter-protest of left-wing activists.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to burn the Koran but police don’t allow it…so we toss it,” one of the speakers says.</p>

      <p>A copy of the Koran is then tossed into a bucket, but almost immediately after another participant lights a copy on fire.</p>
      <p>Several Muslims vault steel fences to try to attack the man who burned the Koran and police immediately rush in to intervene.</p>
      <p>Both the attackers and the man who burned the Koran were arrested.</p>
      <p>The stunt is similar in nature to those pulled by Danish politician Rasmus Paludan, who routinely stirs the anger of Muslims by burning or otherwise disrespecting the Koran.</p>
