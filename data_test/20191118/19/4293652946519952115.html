      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:23:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p>It appears as though <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/players/kawhi-leonard/512591">Kawhi Leonard</a> is sitting out his third game in a row.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/los-angeles-clippers/">Los Angeles Clippers</a> superstar forward will miss Monday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, according to <i>ESPN’s</i> Ramona Shelburne.</p>

      <p>The 28-year-old hasn’t suited up for the Clippers since suffering a left knee contusion during the second half of Los Angeles’ 102-93 loss to the Houston Rockets last week.</p>
      <p>Leonard’s absences have corresponded with teammate Paul George’s return to the team’s lineup. George made his debut against the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>
      <p>Leonard is averaging 26.8 points, 8.9 rebounds and six assists through nine games with the Clippers.</p>
