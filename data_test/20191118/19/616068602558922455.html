      <p>A local car dealership is holding a food drive in support of the food bank this holiday season. </p>
      <p>Parker’s Chrysler is inviting the public to drop off non-perishable food items by Dec. 15 for the Salvation Army. </p>
      <p>“This can be a difficult time of year for many, so we have decided to support the Salvation Army Food Bank with donations of non-perishable items and monetary donations, states Jim Tabler, general manager of Parker’s Chrysler.</p>
      <p>Those that donate will be entered in a draw to win one of three prizes: a $200 service credit, $175 detail package or $500 off the purchase of a vehicle. </p>
      <p>“We are excited about this community drive and are also hoping to raise some much-needed monetary donations. Bring your cash or cheque for the Salvation Army to Parkers and we are going to match all donations up to $1000,” added Tabler. </p>
      <p>The dealership is hoping to raise at least $2,000.</p>
