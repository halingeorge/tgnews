      <h1>Manny Pacquiao's two-man shortlist for boxing return next spring</h1>
      <h2>Filipino legend Pacquiao, who was last seen beating Keith Thurman and also defeated Adrien Broner in 2019, will be out of action until April or May next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:58:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manny-pacquiao">Manny Pacquiao</a> will fight either Mikey or Danny Garcia when he returns to the ring next year.</p>
      <p>The eight-weight world champion recorded impressive victories over Adrien Broner and Keith Thurman in 2019.</p>
      <p>And despite being 40, he has no plans to retire with his next fight pencilled in for April or May.</p>
      <p>Pacquiao will be free from his political obligations in the Philippines Senate next spring as he looks to continue his legendary career.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mikey-garcia">Mikey Garcia</a> has not fought since he lost to Errol Spence on his welterweight debut earlier this year but plans to continue at 147lb.</p>

      <p>His namesake <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/danny-garcia">Danny</a> has alternated victories and defeats in his last four fights, including losses to Thurman and Shawn Porter.</p>
      <p>Mikey Garcia has long campaigned to fight Pacquiao with his uncle Peter telling Fight Hype recently: “Whenever he doesn’t have a fight, he spars two times a week…but since two weeks ago, he’s been coming five times a week.</p>
      <p>“My grandpa said, ‘He’s going to get a date soon. He doesn’t come on Tuesdays when he doesn’t have a fight coming up.’ It’s still in negotiations. It’s a fight that me, my dad and my grandpa like at welterweight.</p>
      <p>“He decided last year after he fought Robert Easter, when he started calling out Errol Spence. All of us thought, ‘yeah, it’s a fight [against Pacquiao] he could take, if we could get ready for, it was a fight that he could possibly win.</p>
      <p>"There was a fight that was not easier. I’m not saying Pacquiao is an easier fight, but it’s more easier in terms of size. He’s a smaller guy.</p>
      <p>"He’s moved up a lot of weight. Errol’s a guy that has to cut weight. He’s a big guy at welterweight. The style is a lot more difficult."</p>
      <p>Pacquiao's decision to focus on either Garcia means Britain's Amir Khan will once again miss out on a shot at his former sparring partner.</p>
