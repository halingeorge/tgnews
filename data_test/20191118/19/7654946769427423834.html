      <h1>Aaron Judge attends ex-teammate’s wedding with girlfriend Samantha Bracksieck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:14:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:14</time> by <a rel="author">Jaclyn Hendricks</a></address>
      <p>Wedding bells were ringing this weekend, but not for Aaron Judge and girlfriend Samantha Bracksieck.</p>
      <p>The Yankees superstar attended the nuptials of minor league player Eric Jagielo, <a href="https://www.sportsgossip.com/aaron-judge-and-samantha-bracksieck-attended-his-minor-league-teammates-wedding-this-weekend/">according to SportsGossip.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Jagielo, a third baseman, was drafted by the Yankees in 2013 and was traded to the Reds two years later. He was acquired by the Marlins last year and released from the team in March.</p>
      <p>As for Judge, the 27-year-old outfielder has been spending time with Bracksieck after the Yankees <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/20/yankees-are-broken-after-this-cruel-ending/">fell to the Astros</a> in Game 6 of the ALCS. The couple <a href="https://www.sportsgossip.com/aaron-judge-and-his-girlfriend-samantha-bracksieck-spotted-at-the-lakers-and-suns-game-in-phoenix/">reportedly hit a Suns game</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Bracksieck was Judge’s No. 1 fan throughout the MLB playoffs. In October, she and model Chase Carter, who has been linked to fellow Yankees star Giancarlo Stanton, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/08/girlfriends-of-aaron-judge-giancarlo-stanton-support-yankees-in-alds-win/">supported the Bombers</a> during the ALDS.</p>
      <p>Carter and Stanton have <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/giancarlo-stanton-checks-out-ufcs-arianny-celeste-amid-model-breakup-rumors/">reportedly split since.</a></p>
