      <p>Accountancy firm KPMG has announced that it will not be renewing its sponsorship of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>’s Pitch@Palace scheme.</p>
      <p>It comes after the the Duke of York gave an interview to the BBC, in which he denied he had sex with Virginia Roberts when she was 17.</p>
      <p>In the interview on Saturday, the Prince was also questioned about his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Royal commentators described the royal’s Newsnight appearance as a ‘car crash.’</p>
      <p>The Financial Times reported that in light of the Duke’s tone in the interview, companies have begun reconsidering their links to him.</p>
      <p>The Pitch@Palace scheme is an initiative that seeks to ‘amplify and accelerate the work of entrepeneurs’.</p>
      <p>KPMG’s sponsorship of the scheme came to an end in October and the accountancy firm has decided not to renew it, according to Sky News.</p>

      <p>The Duke’s BBC interview, where he denied allegations that he had sex with Virginia Roberts at a socialite’s London home in 2001, because he returned to his house after a children’s party on the night in question and has no recollection of ever meeting her.</p>
      <p>At times, the Prince was accused of giving a contradictory account, during his interview with the BBC’s Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>Ms Roberts claimed she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times between 1999 and 2002 and that the royal ‘poured with perspiration’ when they danced in a London night club in 2001.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew said during the interview that he was unable to sweat at all after ‘an adrenaline overdose during the Falklands war.’</p>
      <p>The claim was questioned by Dr Hilary Jones, who described the Prince’s claim as ‘extraordinary’, and said he was ‘very very sceptical’, given that sweating is not mediated by adrenaline.</p>
