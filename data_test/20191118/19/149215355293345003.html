      <p>Rutter <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/contestant-zone/hall-of-fame">holds the record</a> for all-time <i>Jeopardy!</i> winnings including tournaments with $4.6 million, followed by Jennings with $3.3 million and Holzhauer with $2.4 million. Jennings, however, holds the record for most consecutive games won at 74, as well as highest winnings during regular season play. During Holzhauer's unbelievable run on the show earlier this year, he repeatedly shattered the record for single-game winnings, reaching a high of $131,127. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jeopardy-icon-ken-jennings-jokes-james-holzhauer-voodoo-doll">Jennings teased</a> in June he would "love to" face off against Holzhauer, adding the idea would be "irresistible," although he noted, "it's been 15 years since I was in <i>Jeopardy!</i> shape."</p>
      <p>In this tournament, the first player to win three matches will take home $1 million and be declared the show's all-time greatest player, per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jeopardy-top-winners-compete-alex-trebek-hosted-special-1255718?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>. "Based on their previous performances, these three are already the 'greatest,' but you can't help wondering: who is the best of the best?" host Alex Trebek said.</p>
      <p>This, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/11/18/jeopardy-james-holzhauer-ken-jennings-brad-rutter-duel-abc/4201669002/"><i>USA Today </i>reports</a>, will be the first time <i>Jeopardy! </i>has aired on a major network on prime time since 1990.
