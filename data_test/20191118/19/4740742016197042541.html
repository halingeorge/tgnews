      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:29:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>When Rob McCauley was handed his baby in the delivery suite he said it felt like the world had colour for the first time.</p>
      <p>The salesman had previously being living off benefits, depressed and angry at the world after being physically and emotionally abused as a child.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/stockwood">Stockwood</a> man turned his life around after he became a dad and has now penned his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dadsadvicebeforeiforget/">first book.</a></p>
      <p><i>Before I Forget</i> offers advice to children as they go through their lives and develop into adults.</p>
      <p>From what to do if you're bullied, low in confidence, depressed or even suicidal, Rob provides moving and honest advice to the reader.</p>
      <p>Every page is signed off with <i>'love dad'</i> and Rob hopes his two children will be able to keep the book and refer back to it throughout their lives.</p>
      <p>"I had some very dark times growing up," said Rob.</p>
      <p>"As a child and young adult I was physically and emotionally abused. That left me broken- low in confidence, depressed and angry at the world.</p>
      <p>"When I was a young adult I drank a lot and took a lot of drugs.</p>
      <p>"My hand was hovering over the self-destruct bottom - I was running away from my childhood.</p>
      <p>"When I had Freya it felt like the world had colour for the first time.</p>
      <p>"Before I could barely look after myself and suddenly I had this gorgeous little princess who was relying on me."</p>
      <p>After working on the book for two years, Rob has already sold-out of his first batch of 100 copies which he self-published.</p>
      <p>His book has been selling across the world including in Australia and America.</p>
      <p>He has now ordered a second batch and already has a long waiting list for copies.</p>
      <p>"I realised because of my life experience there was a lot I've learnt that I could pass on." said Rob.</p>
      <p>"I hope parents will buy it for their kids and give it to them at the appropriate time.</p>
      <p>"It's something people can refer back to throughout their lives."</p>
