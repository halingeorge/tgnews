      <p>A resident of Jonnagiri in Tuggali mandal of Kurnool district, Lingamayya, 26, was allegedly given poison reportedly by his newly-wed wife at his in-law’s house at Madanantapuram village of Maddikera (East) mandal of Kurnool district on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Lingamayya’s brother shifted him to Gooty government hospital when he found him unconscious. Lingamayya was later shifted to Anantapur Government General Hospital for better treatment. The victim’s condition is stable and there was no danger as of now, the doctors said.</p>
      <p>Lingamayya told mediapersons at Anantapur that he got married a week ago and was at his in-law’s house when his wife allegedly mixed something in the milk and gave him, which made him fall unconscious.</p>
      <p>The Gooty police said they had not registered any case as it fell in the Jonnagiri police limits in Kurnool and the personnel there had been informed. The Maddikera police too did not register an FIR as none lodged a complaint with them. A medico legal case has been generated from the Gooty hospital.</p>
