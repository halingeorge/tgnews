      <h1>Government should encourage cooperative banks, societies: Bhat</h1>

      <p>Raghupati Bhat, MLA, said on Monday that he would urge the State government to direct departments under it to open their accounts and keep their deposits in cooperative banks and societies to promote the latter. He was presiding over the inaugural function of the 66th All India Cooperation Week celebrations organised by the Karnataka State Co-Op Credit Societies Federation Ltd. and other cooperative organizations, here.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bhat said that he would also urge the government to direct religious institutions under it to open their accounts and keep their deposits in the cooperative banks and societies. The cooperative banks and societies should help one another as this would help all of them prosper. The spirit of cooperation was ingrained in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts. This was illustrated by the fact that since 500 years, the traditional boat fishermen followed this method. About 15 to 20 fishermen used to go in their boats collect the fish and then sell it and distribute the returns from it equally among the members, he said.</p>
      <p>M.N. Rajendra Kumar, president, Karnataka State Cooperative Marketing Federation, welcomed the reported statement of Home Minister, Basavaraj Bommai, who was also the Minister for Cooperatives, that the government was planning to direct its departments to open their accounts in cooperative banks and societies. It was only the cooperative banks that went the extra mile to help farmers when compared to commercial banks. Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts were known for 100% agricultural loan repayment. Self Help Groups in this region had women who were economically self-reliant, he said.</p>
      <p>N. Ganganna, president, Karnataka State Cooperative Credit Societies Federation, said the Union and State governments should treat both cooperative and commercial banks equally. Presently, cooperative banks were taxed more compared to the corporate banks. This discrimination should end, he said.</p>
      <p>Dinakar Babu, ZP president, Sheela K. Shetty, vice-president, Neeta Gururaj, president of Udupi Taluk Panchayat, Yashpal Suvarna, president of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi Fish Marketing Federation, Raviraj Hegde, president of Dakshina Kannada Milk Producersâ€™ Union, and Deviprasad Shetty and Kaup Diwakar Shetty, cooperative leaders, were present.</p>
