      <p>A parking lot has been established on the land that had previously been a part of the Ooty Race Course and was recently handed over to the district administration by the Madras Race Club (MRC).</p>
      <p>The 1.6-acre plot of land, near the ATC Junction in Udhagamandalam town, was handed over to the administration a few months ago. It wanted to establish a parking lot in the area to ease congestion along the town’s major roads.</p>
      <p>Police officials said that the parking lot had been opened for the public since Saturday, and expressed the hope that with more parking space for vehicles, traffic congestion on Upper Bazaar Road, Main Bazaar Road, Commercial Road and Ettines Road would reduce.</p>
      <p>“We have already put up barricades along certain sections of these roads where bottlenecks can occur due to illegal parking,” said a police official, adding that business owners surrounding the Ooty Municipal Market had been asked to stop parking vehicles on the road, and use the parking lot instead.</p>
      <p>Police are imposing fines on people stopping in “No Parking” zones, with wheel clamps also being used on vehicles parked in these zones.</p>
      <p>Municipal officials said there were plans to lay concrete or interlock bricks to pave the surface of the parking lot, as vehicles entering the space were damaging the ground. They also said that over a 100 vehicles could be easily kept off the surrounding roads, especially during the tourist season, because of the parking lot.</p>
