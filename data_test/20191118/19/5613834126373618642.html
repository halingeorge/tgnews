      <h1>[Trailer] “The World Before”: Preview November 24th’s Midseason Finale of “The Walking Dead”</h1>

      <p>Truth be told, I haven’t actually been watching <b>“The Walking Dead”</b> this season, aside from catching the season ten premiere back in early October. And that’s honestly weird to say, as I’ve been a watcher, fan and defender of the series ever since it premiered back in 2010. But with so much else to watch, including countless movies and other shows, I couldn’t help but fall off the bandwagon this season. I do plan on catching up at some point, mind you, but I can’t honestly say I feel like I’m missing much of anything by sitting this season out.</p>
      <p>I bring this up not to dunk on “The Walking Dead” but merely to note that I don’t have much to offer when it comes to writing about the show at the moment; if you’re wondering why our coverage of the series has come to a halt, that’d be why. That said, I do realize the tenth season’s mid-season finale is this coming Sunday night, and we’ve got the trailer today.</p>
      <p>In <b>“The World Before”</b>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“A fight causes tensions in Oceanside; The Alexandrians set out on a high-stakes mission.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The mid-season finale airs on Sunday night, <b>November 24th</b>.</p>
      <p>Have YOU still been watching? And if so, have I been missing anything good?</p>
