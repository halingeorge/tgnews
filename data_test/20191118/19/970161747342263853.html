        <b>Constance Wu is too ‘self-conscious’ to ever watch herself in Hustlers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Fresh Off the Boat star admitted she ‘probably’ will never watch the popular film about strippers taking their lives back from their clientele.</p>
      <p>‘Probably not,’ the star admitted to Mindy Kaling when asked whether she’d watch it.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not that I don’t watch all my projects, it’s a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>‘If it’s going to help my work to watch something, I’ll watch it, but if I think it’s just going to make me self-conscious about my work in the future and damage my work, then I don’t.’</p>
      <p>Speaking for <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/constance-wu-wont-watch-hustlers-1203405678/">Variety’s Actors on Actors</a> issue, the 37-year-old continued: ‘I think Destiny is in such a vulnerable… she has such a huge arc, she changes from beginning, middle to end.</p>

      <p>‘I feel like if I watch it too much, I’ll get analytical and self-conscious and it’ll affect my performance in the future. But I’m so glad people are enjoying it, and I had the best time doing it.’</p>
      <p>Constance starred in the crime movie alongside Jennifer Lopez, Lili Reinhart and Cardi B but believes her future projects might be impacted if she watches the movie.</p>

      <p>She also praised Hustlers director Lorene Scafaria for the natural direction she took the film.</p>
      <p>Constance explained: ‘[She] doesn’t come from a place of, “Oh, let’s humanise this woman.” She already understands that this is how she’s going to frame her story within the context of something that you would think would have the male gaze because it’s about women who work in strip clubs.’</p>
      <p>Agreeing with the statement, Mindy replied: ‘I remember thinking nothing felt exploitative. As [a] woman, I love seeing beautiful women dance, but the way that [Hustlers] was shot, there was nothing prurient, which I thought was really refreshing.</p>
      <p>‘On a producer standpoint, I feel like I can’t come to these things and talk about how important it is that we have representation and then hire some white dude to direct my movie.’</p>
