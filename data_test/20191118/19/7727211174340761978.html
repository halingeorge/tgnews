      <p>A child who asked Father Christmas for "a house and food" has received an incredible offer from a local football star.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/">The player</a> , who did not want to be named, was among thousands who reached out after reading a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/desperate-child-7-writes-note-17273049?fbclid=IwAR0qJ7qVseE9vrAaA7KDpw8wz9i7W5CaOmu7cUfeLma-aA4MoG8B4jUm1h0">heartbreaking note written by a seven-year-old</a> to Santa ahead of the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">holiday period</a> .</p>
      <p>The note came to light after the team at the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/how-run-down-community-centre-16051826">L6 Community Centre</a> , in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton">Everton</a> , began decorating for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> .</p>
      <p>A "Santa postbox" was place in the centre's cafe for visiting children to send notes to Old Saint Nick.</p>
      <p>However, one child used the postbox as an opportunity to ask him to help their family.</p>

      <p>The note said: "Dear Father Christmas. Can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas?</p>
      <p>"Mam wants us to be all together, can you give us some food and can I just have just nice doll for Christmas. Thank you."</p>
      <p>Thousands of people were left devastated by the situation the child is in and reached out to try and help.</p>
      <p>On Facebook, people offered to donate cash, food, clothes and presents to the child and their family in the hope of making Christmas easier for them.</p>
      <p>A local <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/">sport star</a> was also touched by the note and offered to help.</p>

      <p>The player, in his 20s, branded the situation a "disgrace" and said that the thought that some children go without "kills him".</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> , he said: "I would love to get in touch with the family and help them have a good Christmas.</p>
      <p>"Every Christmas I always want to help people less fortunate and to see people who live in the same city as us struggling to give their children what most kids get kills me.</p>
      <p>"Also to see the child is not feeding properly is a disgrace and the country as a whole should make sure that’s not the case.</p>
      <p>"How there can be people in our country in poverty is beyond belief."</p>
      <p>He added that he wouldn't want the child to go into school and not be able to say that they received something special for Christmas.</p>

      <p>He said: "Also that child will go into school and have kids saying 'I got this, I got that, what did you get?' and they either have to respond nothing special or lie and make things up.</p>
      <p>"I want to help so that this child can feel special and equal to other kids because they’re not inferior and may feel they’re a bad child as every one says if your good Father Christmas will get you what you ask for."</p>
      <p>Aside from the small request of a doll, the footballer said that it was devastating the child was asking for basic necessities such as shelter and food.</p>
      <p>He added: "And in this case things are that bad the child is asking for what most take for granted and at that young age should be worrying about what game to play next not what meal comes next."</p>
      <p>Cllr Woodhouse said the letter shows the reality at how much some families in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">Merseyside</a> are struggling.</p>

      <p>He  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO:</a>  "This is what we're in sadly. What is upsetting is a seven-year-old in November is already worrying about Christmas.</p>
      <p>"No wonder young people have mental health problems, it's just so sad.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately it is what we see at the L6 centre.</p>
      <p>"This is just one of many that we're going to see from now until Christmas."</p>
      <p>The councillor said he and the L6 centre team are trying their best to help the family with basic needs such as accommodation and food.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/grim-reality-desperately-trying-survive-16765645">Cllr Woodhouse</a>  also believes the amount of referrals the centre will receive this year will increase from the previous year.</p>
      <p>He added: "Referrals are coming in already in November and it is just so sad.</p>
      <p>"Last year was bad, but it is going to be worse this year, we're seeing it now and we don't officially open for referrals - we have over a 100 so far."</p>
      <p>The team at the L6 Community Centre are giving out more than 20,000 toys for children and will also accepting emergency referrals leading up to Christmas day.</p>
      <p>The centre has also set up a GoFundMe page to support their foodbank and Christmas appeal.</p>
