      <p>The State government made amendments to the A.P. Solar Power Policy, 2018, A.P. Wind Power Policy, 2018, and A.P. Wind-Solar Hybrid Power Policy, 2018 to the effect that the tariff for solar/wind power projects or solar-wind hybrid projects or any other variable Renewable Energy (RE) project should not exceed the difference between pooled variable cost and balancing cost, which will be determined by A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC).</p>
      <p>The tariff for solar rooftop projects for net or gross metering should not exceed the difference of pooled variable cost and balancing cost or the applicable tariff at the time of Commercial Operation Date (CoD) whichever is less.</p>
      <p>Besides, the government stated that all government land allotments for renewable energy projects should be made on lease-hold basis and has withdrawn the facility of energy banking and drawl from all the generators and stated that any injection of energy between synchronisation and declaration of CoD would be treated as inadvertent power and no cost be paid for it by the DISCOMs.</p>
      <p>The government has further mentioned that the transmission and distribution charges should be determined by the APERC for connectivity to the nearest Central Transmission Utilities and State Transmission Utilities (STUs) for inter-State wheeling of power and via STUs for intra-State wheeling.</p>
