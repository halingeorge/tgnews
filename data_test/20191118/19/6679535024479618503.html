      <h1>City’s rain deficit to reduce</h1>
      <h2>Trough off the coast set to bring showers to most of T.N.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:54:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The northeast monsoon, which has remained subdued for a while, is expected to strengthen this week. Several parts of the State, including Chennai, are expected to receive fairly widespread rainfall through the week, raising expectations of the deficit that resulted owing to the long dry spell coming down.</p>
      <p>A trough of easterlies, from the equatorial Indian Ocean off the south Sri Lanka coast to the southwest Bay of Bengal off north Tamil Nadu coast, persists and may influence rains over the State till Friday.</p>
      <p>Chennai has a chance of experiencing light to moderate rainfall till Wednesday. The lull in monsoon activity during November has pushed the seasonal rainfall into the red in 17 districts, including Cuddalore, Vellore and Villupuram. Chennai and Ariyalur have a 41% and 44% shortfall, respectively. Since October 1, Chennai district has recorded 29 cm of rain, against its seasonal share of 49 cm.</p>
      <p>N. Puviarasan, Director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Chennai, said rains would begin in coastal areas and then move inland by Wednesday. There would be an increase in rainfall on Wednesday and 76-100% of weather stations are likely to get rainfall.</p>
      <p>During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Monday, some places received moderate showers. Tarangambadi in Nagapattinam district received the highest volume of 3 cm.</p>
      <p>One or two places in a few districts, including Dharmapuri, Ramanathapuram and Tirunelveli, may record heavy rain up to 12 cm on Tuesday. Districts such as Cuddalore, Thanjavur and Villupuram may get isolated heavy rain on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Tamil Nadu as a whole has received 27 cm against the average of 30 cm for the season so far. A shortfall of 7% is still considered normal by the Meteorological Department. Though November is considered the wettest month of the year, there have been years in the past when deficit has been compensated in December. In 2015, rains picked up pace in mid-November.</p>
