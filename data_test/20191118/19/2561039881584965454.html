      <p>The Castro Podcast app has been updated with numerous new features and improvement including the ability to sync to Apple Watch, stream to Apple Watch, adjust playback speed on Apple Watch.<br/><br/><i>Castro is a beautiful, full-featured podcast player that makes it easy to track and manage lots of podcasts at the same time. Only listen to the episodes you want and easily skip the rest, queue up hours of podcasts at a time and enjoy a seamless listening experience with carplay compatibility, chapter support, trim silence and much, much more!</i><br/><br/><b>What's New In This Version:</b><br/>● WATCH SYNC IS HERE<br/>All your favorite podcasts on your wrist. <br/><br/>Watch sync frees you up to listen completely untethered from your iPhone. Whether you’re out on a run, your kids have your phone during a road trip, or you just want to go phoneless for a while to minimise distractions, Castro’s Watch Sync has your favorite shows ready to listen. <br/><br/>● QUEUE AUTO SYNC<br/>The magic of Castro is in the queue, a wonderful place to set your listening on autopilot without clogging your phone with unwanted downloads. With Queue Auto Sync, Castro mirrors your listening between devices and automatically has what’s next ready to listen whenever you need it. You can limit synced episodes to the next 10, 20, or 30 in your Queue. <br/><br/>Episodes will sync to your watch when you’re on wifi, and will sync fastest when your watch is charging. You can kick off syncing any time from Settings &gt; Watch Sync &gt; Sync to Watch Now<br/><br/>● SEND TO WATCH<br/>See an episode in your queue you’d like to take with you? Any downloaded episode that isn’t already on your watch will have a Send to Watch button at the ready. <br/><br/>● WATCH STREAMING<br/>Not into syncing? Castro can now stream episodes in your queue straight from the watch over wifi or cellular. <br/><br/>● PLAYBACK SPEED<br/>Whether you’re listening on your phone or from your watch you can now control playback speed from the watch app. Neat. <br/><br/>● GET IT NOW<br/>Castro Plus subscribers running iOS 13 and watchOS 6 can get Watch Sync by downloading this update and turning on Watch Sync in Settings. Enjoy!<br/><br/>● OTHER CHANGES<br/>- Support for the following watch face complications: "Graphic Bezel", "Graphic Circular", "Graphic Corner"<br/>- New haptic feedback when dragging and dropping episodes<br/>- Fixed a bug with rearranging episodes in the queue on iOS 13.2<br/>- Fixed a few different crashes that could happen when restoring from a backup<br/>- CarPlay should resume properly after using Siri now<br/>- Castro Plus pitch screen now includes a slide about hiding promoted content<br/>- Promoted posts in discovery shouldn't swap out unexpectedly any more<br/>- Fresh App Store installs shouldn't need "Restore Purchases" any more if Castro Plus subscription is still valid<br/>- Fix for sending logs to support to help with debugging issues<br/>- Text in discovery features now supports italic and bold formatting, how very 1990s of us (blinking text is as of yet unsupported)<br/><br/>You can download Castro Podcast Player from the App Store for free.<br/><br/><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241?at=11l655">Download</a></p>
