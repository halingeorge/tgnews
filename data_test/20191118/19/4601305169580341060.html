      <p>If you want to know more about Choudhury, you can watch an upcoming Netflix documentary about him, called <i>Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator, </i>premiering November 20, 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-horrifying-cult-origins-of-bikram-yoga-rape-harassment-and-lies?ref=hvper.com&amp;utm_source=hvper.com&amp;utm_medium=website">Daily Beast</a> has a review:</p>
      <blockquote>[A]t closed-off, multi-week classes held at hotels around the country, Bikram was constantly supplied Bikram with fresh new females who wanted nothing more than to earn his favor. Sexual assault—quite a lot of it, by many accounts—followed, although out of fear of being kicked out of the profession they loved, most refused to publicly speak out. Sarah Baughn changed all that, filing suit against Bikram in March 2013 for allegedly trapping her in his hotel room and forcibly trying to initiate sex. Though she was condemned and ostracized by those in Bikram’s camp, other ugly stories soon emerged, including from Larissa Anderson, who says she was raped by Bikram in his home, and from Jafa-Bodden, who sued Bikram for unlawful termination after she refused to continue being party to his predatory behavior. <br/><br/>Doing the guru no favors are deposition videos in which he pleads the fifth and, when speaking, curses Jafa-Bodden’s attorney Carla Minnard and admits that the four things he doesn’t like are “cold weather, cold food, cold hearts and cold pussy.”</blockquote>
      <p>Facing multiple lawsuits and sexual harassment allegations, Choudhury fled the United States for India in 2016, <a href="https://www.mid-day.com/articles/disgraced-hot-yoga-guru-bikram-choudhury-winds-up-us-business-sets-shop-in-lonavla/17272159">where he is operating yoga studios</a>.</p>
