      <p>Zamfara State Police Command on Monday confirmed the killing of 14 persons and injuring of 10 others by bandits in Karaye village of Gummi Local Government Area of the state.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that the attack is the first major breach of the peace agreement between the state government and the bandits initiated by Governor Bello Matawalle.</p>
      <p>A statement issued to newsmen in Gusau by the command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Muhammad Shehu said the attack occurred on Sunday.</p>
      <p>According to him, a total of 14 persons were killed, 10 others sustained gunshot injuries while some houses were set ablaze.</p>
      <p>Shehu recalled that on November 3, some members of a local vigilante group, known as “Yan Sakai” in Bardoki village, attacked and killed nine Fulanis under the suspicion that they were bandits.</p>
      <p>He said on receiving the report, the command arrested 11 members of the vigilantes suspected of actively participating in the killing of the Fulanis.</p>
      <p>The command’s spokesman said Sunday’s attack might have been a reprisal attack.</p>
      <p>“The incident is being investigated by the State CID Gusau and all the suspects will be charged to court for prosecution in order to serve as a deterrent to others.</p>
      <p>“However, combined teams attached to Operation puff Adder, men of Operation Hadarin-Daji and vigilantes led by the DPO Gummi mobilised to the scene and embarked on extensive bush combing with a view to trailing and arresting the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>“Corpses and injured victims were conveyed to the General Hospital Gummi for autopsy and treatment, ” he explained.</p>
