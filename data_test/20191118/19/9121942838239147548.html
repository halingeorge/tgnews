      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Samir Doughty scored 20 points, Austin Wiley had 13 points and 10 rebounds, and No. 19 Auburn rolled past Colgate 91-62 on Monday night.</p>
      <p>The Tigers improved to 5-0 for the first time in 15 years and used a 13-2 run to jump on their Patriot League foe early in the first half.</p>
      <p>Auburn shot 63% from the field, including 53% from 3-point territory, and outscored Colgate 28-16 in the paint in the first half. J’Von McCormick was the orchestrator, finishing with a team-high eight assists and 14 points, with only two turnovers, while Isaac Okoro and Danjel Purifoy scored 11 points apiece.</p>
      <p>Colgate (1-3) struggled to get anything going against the Tigers’ overwhelming size and suffocating defense, shooting just 9-for-32 from the field and 1-for-11 from beyond the arc in the first half. The Raiders, who made the NCAA Tournament last season, did outscore the Tigers in the second half.</p>
      <p>Auburn had a 41-33 advantage in rebounding against the Patriot League’s preseason favorite and scored 15 points off fast breaks to finish the rout.</p>
      <p>Jordan Burns had 18 points and Rapolas Ivanauskas added 12 for the Raiders.</p>
