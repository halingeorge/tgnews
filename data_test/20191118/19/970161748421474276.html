      <p>More than 20 drug dealers have been convicted after fed-up residents put up parody road signs to pressure police into investigating them.</p>
      <p>Signs looking like official road markings started appearing in 2018, with tongue-in-cheek twists such as ‘Give way to oncoming drug dealers’, ‘Needle-free zone’ and ‘Crack pick-up point’.</p>
      <p>Parking bays were marked ‘drug dealers only’ in an area which saw drugs being dealt in broad daylight in front of kids.</p>
      <p>People living around a drugs hot-spot in Columbia Road, east London, had teamed up with anonymous artists, calling themselves the Columbia Road Cartel.</p>
      <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said a police investigation was launched as a result of the campaign and identified four separate phone lines being used to supply Class A substances in the area.</p>

      <p>Four successful prosecutions took place, with sentencing for the final case wrapping up today.</p>

      <p>Five men aged 29-33 were jailed for a total of 18 years, with another two, 49 and 56, handed three-year suspended sentences and a 31-year-old had his sentencing date deferred to April 2020.</p>
      <p>The group, all from the local area, were arrested in February. Brendan Vickers, 26, was jailed for three years after police arrested him in his home with 100 wraps of crack cocaine and heroin on his living room table.</p>
      <p>The CPS identified a total of 24 men convicted in connection with the drug gangs’ activities.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Shepherd, a Senior Crown Prosecutor at CPS London North, said: ‘These defendants showed little consideration for those around them – often openly dealing drugs in the day in front of young children and encouraging aggressive drug users to loiter in the area.</p>

      <p>‘The different phone lines represented a coordinated effort between various drugs operations to work together to deal dangerous drugs, in effect blighting the local community to such an extent that they felt they had to take action.’</p>
      <p>‘These successful prosecutions show that that the CPS takes drug dealing extremely seriously and will bring offenders to court to face justice.’</p>
