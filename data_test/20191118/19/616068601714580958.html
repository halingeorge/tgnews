      <p>The City of Kelowna will have about $30,000 to spend as a legacy from the 55+ Games held in the city back in September.</p>
      <p>Games chairman David Graham told council Monday the games realized a surplus of about $60,000, half of which remains with the city. The rest goes to the BC Games Society.</p>
      <p>Graham says a recommendation on how to spend that money within the sports sector will be brought before council in the coming months.</p>
      <p>The 2008 BC Games left a $66,000 legacy. $16,000 of that went to improvements to the score clock at a field hockey pitch in the Mission.</p>
      <p>The rest helped support a sports coaching education program.</p>
      <p>Graham told council the senior games were the most successful ever. About 4,100 athletes took part, with another 1,500 volunteers assisting over the course of the four days.</p>
      <p>"Some of the sports were very well attended," said Graham.</p>
      <p>"Ice hockey had nearly 500 athletes compete. Dragonboat racing had about 500 athletes as did pickleball."</p>
      <p>He added hotels and restaurants were full for much of the weekend, however, a final audit on the economic impact of the games has not yet been complete.</p>
