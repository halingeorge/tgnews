      <p>Federal University Dutsinma in Katsina State, has appealed to members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities nationwide and other Nigerians to pray for the release of Abubakar Idris, a Senior Lecturer in the university, abducted three months ago.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that Idris, a lecturer in the university’s department of languages and linguistics was abducted on August 2, at his residence in Kaduna State.</p>
      <p>A statement by FUDUMA’s Acting Director Public Relations and Protocol, Habibu Matazu, issued on Monday in Katsina,  also appealed to the abductors to release the lecturer.</p>
      <p>The university noted that since the abduction, there had been no trace of the victim, as there was no demand for ransom nor any other lead on his whereabouts.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the university management had reported the matter to all the relevant security agencies and Governor Aminu Masari for their intervention.</p>
      <p>“It is inhuman and abuse of human right, the abduction of a family man like Abubakar Idris whose detention had generated tension and uncertainties in members of the university community and his family in particular.”</p>
      <p>The management assured ASUU and other members of the university community that it would not relent in working more closely with security agencies to get the lecturer back home safely.</p>
      <p>The statement added that the management had approved financial support for the family of Idris and had delegated a three-man committee to sympathise with them over the incident.</p>
      <p>“The university appeals to the abductors to kindly release him so he can report back to his workplace and loved ones,” it added.</p>
