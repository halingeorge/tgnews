      <p>The Kerala State Literacy Mission has recorded a remarkable jump in the number of candidates appearing for its equivalency examinations.</p>
      <p>In the latest round, 19,950 candidates sat for the fourth standard equivalency exam and 14,950 candidates for the seventh standard equivalency exam. Compared to 2017-18, the candidates for the fourth standard equivalency has more than tripled. The numbers for the seventh standard equivalency test also have more than doubled, Mission authorities said on Monday. In 2016-17, only 2,084 examinees had sat for the fourth standard exam, while 4,040 sat for the class seven equivalency exam. In 2017-18, it rose, respectively, to 5,796 and 5,437.</p>
      <p>The Mission attributed this rise to a July 4, 2018, government order making the Class 12 equivalency exam certificate a qualifying document for higher studies and promotion.</p>
