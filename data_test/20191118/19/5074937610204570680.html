      <p>She said some of the projects embarked on by the Association include the construction of 10 household toilet facilities at Chorkor in Accra, the drilling of two mechanized boreholes at Hwiabaa in the Ahafo Ano North District and the provision of 21 standpipes in Ahwiam in the Tema Metropolis.</p>
      <p>In addition to these, she said, the Association has also adopted Vodzakpo Primary School in the Agortime Kportoe District, under its “you and your community” programme.</p>
      <p>Mrs Amponsah-Asiamah said the Association was not going to be complacent with its achievement, but would continue to work hard to uphold the image of the GWCL whiles maintaining unity and singleness of purpose among members.</p>
      <p>She appealed to management of the GWCL to consider the development of modern offices with the kind of ambience that would be appreciated by their numerous customers.</p>
