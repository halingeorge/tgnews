      <h1>FCC chairman wants public auction to repurpose satellite bands for 5G</h1>
      <h2>Satellite companies aren't very thrilled with the prospect of an auction.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:27:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>The FCC's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/10/fcc-loosens-rules-to-make-5g-available-in-lower-frequenciesafcc-loosens-2-5ghz-band-rules-for-5g/">ongoing 5G push</a> might set up a conflict with the satellite industry. Chairman <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/09/fcc-chairman-jokes-about-being-verizon-shill/">Ajit Pai</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC/status/1196469021358592000?mod=article_inline">pressing</a> for a public auction of wireless frequencies in the C-band spectrum (the 4GHz to 8GHz range often used by satellite companies) for the sake of 5G service. This would help the FCC clear up "significant" frequency space in a quick fashion, generate money for the government and "ensure continued delivery" of existing services, Pai argued. He hoped to auction off a 280MHz slice while leaving the upper 200MHz available.</p>
      <p>An FCC official <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-backs-public-auction-of-5g-airwaves-11574102514">told</a> the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> that the regulator hoped to bring the C-band auction up for a vote in 2020 and start the auction by the end of that year.</p>
      <p>Satellite companies, however, might not be so happy. Industry giants like Intelsat and SES haven't been averse to selling their spectrum, but they've wanted a private auction to share the money they make and have claimed the FCC isn't allowed to take in-use spectrum without paying them. A public auction flies in the face of that. The C-Band Alliance, a group representing the satellite firms, has hinted at "protracted litigation" if the FCC pushes forward. Carriers are also of mixed opinions. AT&amp;T, which owns DirecTV, has <a href="https://www.attpublicpolicy.com/5g/att-statement-on-fcc-chairman-pais-proposal-to-unleash-c-band-spectrum-for-5g/">called</a> C-band an "opportunity" but also wanted compensation and a "reasonable transition plan" to avoid disruptions. Verizon (Engadget's parent company and Pai's former employer) likewise wanted "appropriate incentives and protections" to ensure a quick process.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time the FCC has butted heads in its quest for more 5G airwaves. Senators have accused the FCC of ignoring evidence of possible <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/15/fcc-5g-spectrum-auction-senator-concerns/">interference with weather forecasts</a> if 5G is allowed in the 24GHz band, as an example.</p>
      <p>With that said, there's no doubt that 5G in the US is running into problems as-is. AT&amp;T and Verizon both have to run their current 5G in very high frequency ranges that makes a signal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/04/verizon-5g-network-testing-chicago-data-speeds/">hard to find</a> and all too easy to lose -- it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-verizon-arena-5g-coverage-nba-nhl.html">doesn't even cover complete sports arenas</a> in some cases. C-band access would still sit in a higher range than the LTE you typically use today, but it could provide much wider coverage and more capacity. It may be more a question of when those frequencies open up than whether they do at all.</p>
