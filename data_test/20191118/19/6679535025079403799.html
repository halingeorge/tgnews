      <p>Residents of Kalher in Bhiwandi on Monday expressed their outrage at the police for posthumously booking a 21-year-old accident victim for rash driving.</p>
      <p>According to the Narpoli police, the victim, Piyush Mishra, lived with his family in Manav Residency Complex in Kalher. On August 25, Mishra was on his way home at night when his bike hit a pothole on Bhiwandi-Kalher Road. The police said Mishra fell off the bike, sustained injuries and died on the spot.</p>
      <p>On November 16, the Narpoli police booked Mishra for causing his own death due to rash and negligent driving under sections of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act.</p>
      <p>Senior police inspector M.B. Shinde said, “We conducted thorough inquiries over the last two months and found a couple of eyewitnesses who said in their statements that Mishra was riding the bike at a very high speed. It was speeding that made him lose control of the bike, causing his death.” Mr. Shinde said no CCTV cameras were installed on the stretch where the accident took place.</p>
      <h3>Meeting with DCP</h3>
      <p>Furious with the police action, the residents of the area formed a delegation and met Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Rajkumar Shinde on Monday. The delegation demanded action against those responsible for the maintenance of roads.</p>
      <p>Arvind Jayswar, a local activist who led the delegation, said, “We have conducted our own inquiries into the matter and found out that a private company that runs a toll plaza close to the spot had the contract for maintaining the road. The contract expired a day after the accident. We have conveyed this information to the police and demanded strict action against the company.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Jayswar said the DCP assured the residents that further inquiries would be made into the incident and appropriate action would be taken against the guilty. Mr. Jayswar said, “Mishra’s family is too disturbed to even talk to us. We tried contacting his brother Jayesh, but he refused to speak to us. The family has moved out of Manav Residency Complex. No one seems to know where they are now.”</p>
