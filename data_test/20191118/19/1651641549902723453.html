      <h1>You can now play Rift games on your Oculus Quest with Oculus Link</h1>

        <b>Oculus Link, a new way to experience Oculus Rift content on your Oculus Quest, is officially rolling out today in beta mode.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Announced during Oculus Connect 6, Link is available for anyone who owns a Quest headset and a compatible gaming PC. Oculus Link allows Quest users to access and play Rift content that they previously couldn’t experience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/play-rift-content-on-quest-with-oculus-link-available-now-in-beta/">As Oculus puts it</a>, while the Rift S offers the highest fidelity gaming experience available, the Oculus Quest makes it easier than ever to get into the world of virtual reality.</p>
      <p>The Oculus Link will bridge that gap – effectively linking the two together (pun totally intended) – to broaden the horizons of Quest users while also helping PC developers reach the biggest audience possible.</p>

      <p>Link software is compatible with most high-quality USB 3 cables. Oculus plans to release a premium optical fibre cable later in 2019 in order to provide a best-in-class experience for Quest users.</p>
      <p>Quest owners who own a compatible gaming PC can now simply plug their headset into a USB 3 port and then use the Oculus desktop app to browse and purchase Rift content to play on their Quest. They can also access Rift’s Oculus Home and Dashboard.</p>
      <p>The PC requirements for the Oculus Link are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Processor:</b> Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or greater</li>
        <li><b>Memory:</b> 8GB+ RAM</li>
        <li><b>Operating System:</b> Windows 10</li>
        <li><b>USB Ports:</b> 1x USB 3.0 ports</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only certain GPUs are currently supported, but Oculus plan to add more as development on the Oculus Link beta continues. You can see a table of which NVIDIA GPUs are supported or not below.</p>
