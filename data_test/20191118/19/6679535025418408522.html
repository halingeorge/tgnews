      <p>The commissioning of the Edamon-Kochi 400-kV transmission line will enhance power supply in the State, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.</p>
      <p>He was formally commissioning the power highway project at a function in Adoor on Monday evening.</p>
      <h3>Through 4 districts</h3>
      <p>Mr. Vijayan said the Edamon-Kochi power highway increased the State’s power import capability by 800 MW. It had a total length of 148 km with 447 towers, passing through Kollam (22 km), Pathanamthitta (47 km), Kottayam (51 km), and Ernakulam (28 km). He said Kerala was entitled to 266 MW from the Kudankulam nuclear power station, which has an installed capacity of 2,000 MW.</p>
      <p>The work on the power highway project was entrusted with the Power Grid Corporation of India in March 2008 and was scheduled to be completed by March 2010. But the work was held up and stopped in 2010 owing to protests by local people.</p>
      <p>The government conducted several meetings and discussions with local action councils opposed to the project. A special compensation package was ordered on July 30, 2015. A special task force was also set up for the time-bound completion of the project.</p>
      <h3>Cost put at ₹1,300 crore</h3>
      <p>The work was completed on September 14 and the line energised on September 25. The total project cost, including construction and compensation expenses, was around ₹1,300 crore. A sum of ₹113 crore had been disbursed so far as compensation to landowners.</p>
      <p>Electricity Minister M.M. Mani presided over the function. K.Raju, Forest Minister; Kadannappaly Ramachandran, Minister for Archaeology and Museums; Raju Abraham, Chittayam Gopakumar, Raju Abraham, K.U.Janeeshkumar, Mathew T.Thomas, and Veena George, MLAs, spoke.</p>
