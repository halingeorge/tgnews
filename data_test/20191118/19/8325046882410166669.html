      <p>Trump’s impeachment inquiry is well underway.</p>
      <p>The House of Representatives is investigating whether President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, by threatening to withhold $400 million in military aid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-schedule-how-to-watch-live-updates-2019-11">Hearings hit television</a> for the public to watch last week, and witnesses and questioners are under intense scrutiny.</p>
      <p>So far, three witnesses have given televised testimony – Bill Taylor, acting US ambassador to Ukraine; George Kent, deputy assistant secretary for Europe and Eurasian affairs; and Marie Yovanovitch, former US ambassador to Ukraine. At least <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/impeachment-hearings-schedule-who-is-publicly-testifying-next-2019-11">nine more are scheduled</a> so far in the weeks to come.</p>
      <p>Democrats are hoping the publicized hearings will <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nunes-jordan-lead-gop-attack-in-first-public-public-hearing-2019-11">convince the public</a> that Trump should be impeached. Republicans are trying their best to distract and make the case that Trump should stay in office.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look at the process so far, in photos.</p>

      <h3>On September 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Congress was launching an impeachment inquiry to look into an anonymous complaint that accused President Donald Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. She said Trump’s actions had betrayed his oath as president, national security, and the integrity of US elections.</h3>
