      <p>MOSCOW: Russia said Monday (Nov 18) it had handed over <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/russia-set-to-return-seized-ukrainian-ships--report-12102232">three navy ships it seized a year ago</a> from Ukraine, in the latest move to ease tensions between the two countries ahead of a crucial summit.</p>
      <p>After an exchange of prisoners in September and the withdrawal of some frontline forces over the last few weeks, the handover marked another step in trying to resolve the five-year conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>

      <p>Efforts have been building since the election this year of Volodymyr Zelensky as Ukraine's new president, and on Friday France announced he would hold his first face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris on Dec 9.</p>
      <p>The talks, which will also include French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will be the highest-level negotiations on the conflict since 2016.</p>
      <p>Russia's foreign ministry said on Monday that the ships - two gunboats and a tugboat - had been handed over to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>It said they had "illegally crossed the Russian border" and been held as evidence but were no longer needed.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate confirmation of the handover from Kiev.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian ships were seized in November last year in the most serious confrontation between the two countries since the start of the conflict in 2014.</p>
      <p>Russian forces boarded and took control of the vessels as they headed through the Kerch Strait, a narrow waterway giving access to the Sea of Azov that is used by Ukraine and Russia.</p>
      <p>They captured 24 Ukrainian sailors, who were returned to Ukraine as part of the September prisoner swap.</p>
      <p>Border officials had said on Sunday that the ships would be returned and local television showed footage of them being towed by the Russian coastguard through the Kerch Strait.</p>
      <p>The election of Zelensky, a television comedian who shocked the country's elite by winning the presidency in April, has raised hopes the conflict with pro-Moscow separatists can finally be resolved.</p>
      <p>Zelensky has said ending the war - which has left some 13,000 dead - is his top priority.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FIRST TALKS IN YEARS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The conflict in Ukraine's industrial east broke out after Russia's 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which led the West to impose wide-ranging sanctions on Moscow.</p>
      <p>The separatists have declared unrecognised breakaway statelets in the mainly Russian-speaking Ukrainian eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
      <p>Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Moscow of giving financial and military backing to separatists, which Russia denies.</p>
      <p>September's exchange was the first major step in years to reduce tensions, with the two countries swapping 70 prisoners.</p>
      <p>It was followed over the last few weeks by the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops and separatist forces from several flashpoint areas along the frontline.</p>
      <p>The four-way summit was initially announced by Macron for September, after talks with Putin in France, but was held up until the troop withdrawals took place.</p>
      <p>The structure for the talks is known as the "Normandy format" after a first meeting brought together the four heads of state in France's Normandy region in 2014.</p>
      <p>The last such meeting took place in Berlin in October 2016.</p>
      <p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday confirmed the talks would go ahead on December 9 but sought to downplay talk of a major breakthrough.</p>
      <p>"There was a long delay, a long break in work under the Normandy format, and so we should not set expectations too high," he told reporters.</p>
      <p>It aims to implement the "Minsk agreements", deals reached in 2014 and 2015 to end the conflict but which have yet to be properly put in place.</p>
      <p>The talks are expected to focus on a roadmap that would give special status to the separatist territories if they conduct free and fair elections under the Ukrainian constitution.</p>
      <p>The conflict has been a major drain on Ukraine's economy but Zelensky is facing opposition to his peace plan, especially from war veterans and nationalists.</p>
