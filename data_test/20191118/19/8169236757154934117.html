      <p>Real Madrid starlet Takefusa Kubo showed off his sensational dribbling ability by beating three players in Japan Under 22s’ clash with Colombia.</p>
      <p>In the 24th minute of the match, Kubo picked up the ball and used some lovely pieces of skill to turn one player inside and out before charging forward.</p>
      <p>The ace held off pressure from two further players before laying the ball off to his teammate. The 18-year-old was let down by his pal’s poor attempt at a backheel pass.</p>

      <p>Japan’s Under-22s lost the clash 2-0 and this was one of the more exciting moments of the game, the side need to step up their preparations for the Olympic if they hope to win a medal in their homeland.</p>
      <p>Kubo is a senior international but has been drafted into this side in order to boost the team’s chance of glory in next summer’s games.</p>
