      <p>Taking a cue from the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Fit India’ shibboleth, the TTD board has resolved to construct a sports complex to develop fitness among its employees in Tirupati at a cost of ₹10 crore.</p>
      <p>The TTD has a strong work force of about 23,000 employees out of which 8,000 of them are on regular rolls, 7,000 pensioners (working in various departments) and the rest either on contract or recruited through out sourcing. The TTD welfare department also conducts sports and games for its employees annually.</p>
      <h3>Multifacility building</h3>
      <p>The proposed state-of-the-art complex will have an indoor stadium with two shuttle courts, a gym, an elbow room for table tennis, a six-lane swimming pool with a filtration plant, outdoor sports courts, lawn tennis, volley ball courts with an inbuilt provision for office, chess, carroms, dressing and common rest rooms, cafeteria, sub station and a generator room besides a parking area that would accommodate over 58 four-wheelers and 80 two-wheelers.</p>
      <p>At the request of employees’ union, the board gave its assent to allocate 1.89 acres of land in the proximity of the main administrative building for the construction of the complex.</p>
      <p>The board sanctioned ₹10 crore for the project and directed the engineering committee to conduct a detailed study and submit a report with regard to the identification of the land in the vicinity of Alipiri area on the Tirupati – Cherlopalli by pass road.</p>
