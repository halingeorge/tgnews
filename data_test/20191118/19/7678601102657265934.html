      <h1>From Gojek to Indonesia's rising star, Nadiem included in Time's '100 Next' list</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:38:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author">Kharishar Kahfi</a></address>
      <p>Education and Culture Minister Nadiem Makarim has been recognized by <i>Time</i> magazine on its "100 Next", a list of rising stars expected to shape the future.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old left his position as the CEO of giant ride-hailing company Gojek after being appointed a Cabinet minister. Nadiem founded Gojek in 2015 as a solution to the country's messy transportation system.</p>
      <p>Nine years into operation, the country's first decacorn co-founded by Nadiem, a Harvard Business School graduate, has been used by more than 155 million users in five Southeast Asia countries, including Cambodia, Malaysia and Myanmar. It employs more than 2 million drivers. </p>
      <p>Journalist Amy Gunia wrote on the <i>Time</i> website that Nadiem’s ministerial post put "him in a position to shape the future leaders of the world's 16th largest economy,"</p>
      <p>Brian Harding, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said as quoted by Gunia: "Makarim will bring youthful, entrepreneurial savvy into the Cabinet."</p>

      <p>Nadiem, the only Indonesian to be included on the list, is among 20 individuals listed in the "Leaders" category, along with 39-year-old Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, who is known for his commitment to tackling climate change.</p>
      <p>Other influential figures on the list are actress Awkwafina in the "Advocates" category for promoting racial inclusion and breaking stereotypes and Korean girl band Blackpink in the "Phenom" category for "heralding a new era of Korean acts stepping past language barriers to play global stages".</p>
      <p><i>Time</i> magazine launched its "100 Next" list this year to recognize the influence of rising stars who are shaping the future in their respective fields.</p>
      <p>“They are driven by hope,” <i>Time</i> executive editor Dan Macsai, who oversees the Time 100 franchise, said. “They are eager to defy the odds — and fight for a better future.”</p>
