      <p>CANBY, Ore. – The family of the girl saved by deputies at the scene of a quadruple homicide earlier this year has released another statement thanking first responders for their quick action.</p>
      <p>The Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office was called out on the night of January 19, 2019 on reports of a domestic violence incident that resulted in multiple deaths.</p>
      <p>Investigators say the homicide suspect was about to kill then eight-year-old Hailey Grimm, and deputies were faced with a deadly force situation.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The victims of the homicide included Hailey’s mother, 31-year-old Shaina Sweitzer, and her 9-month-old sister, Olivia Gago. The suspect, who was dating Sweitzer, also allegedly killed his stepfather and mother - Jerry and Pam Bremer.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night, the deputies, lieutenant, and emergency dispatchers who responded to the call and saved Hailey’s life were <a href="https://katu.com/news/local/clackamas-co-deputies-honored-for-quick-action-that-saved-canby-girls-life">honored for their heroic actions at the Oregon Peace Officers Association’s awards banquet</a>.</p>
      <p>Hailey’s father, Jason Grimm, released the following statement on Monday:</p>
      <blockquote>First off, I would like to thank all the officers and especially the ones that were in the house at the time my daughter was being saved and all the emergency crew members and anybody else who helped that night this horrible thing happened. I am so grateful for all of you for what you did.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>She is doing very well now and is enjoying her dance and gymnastics classes and also adjusting and doing very well in the 4th grade. She also really enjoys the Willow Center where she is attending counseling, she likes it and it has helped her out a lot.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>She is in good hands now and has a lot of support going forward.</blockquote>
