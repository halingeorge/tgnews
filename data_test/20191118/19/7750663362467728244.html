      <p>After spending a year in the Championship with Derby County, Tomori has established himself in the centre of Chelsea's backline, while also earning international recognition with England.</p>
      <p>Zola worked on the backroom staff at the Blues last season, and the club legend has acknowledged that the academy graduate's progression has come as 'a big surprise'.</p>
      <p>The Italian is quoted by the <i>London Evening Standard</i> as saying: "Last year we had him in the pre-season and we couldn't see all the qualities that he is showing now.</p>
      <p>"That is a surprise and a big lesson for us and me personally as well. They are going beyond my expectations."</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has made 13 starts in all competitions during the current campaign.</p>
