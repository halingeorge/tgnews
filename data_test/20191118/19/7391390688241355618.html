      <p>Since its early November premiere, <i><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/why-the-morning-show-isnt-the-metoo-story-you-think-it-is-19290207">The Morning Show</a></i> has been battling to justify the price tag of adding yet another streaming platform to your cordless diet. Within the space of a single minute, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/jennifer-aniston-the-morning-show.html">Jennifer Aniston fans</a> (Hi, me! And probably you!) could be convinced to pay double. In the Nov. 15 episode, Aniston's war-ready morning show host Alex Levy joins Billy Crudup's chaotically evil Cory Ellison for a duet of <i>Sweeney Todd</i>'s "Not While I'm Around" while attending a well-heeled Manhattan cocktail party. Until this moment, the characters have been low-key enemies, which makes the electricity between them tricky to interpret. But why bother trying when Weatherman Yanko Flores (Nestor Carbonell) has already put it best: "It's weird and fascinating and I'm super into it."</p>
      <p>The hobnobbing foes are at a live-piano karaoke fundraiser where rich people pay $1,000 for the privilege of singing show tunes to other rich people. (The money goes to the New York Theater Development Fund, but the applause is theirs to keep.)</p>
      <p>Earlier in the episode, Cory half-attempts to offer a truce to Alex. "Hey, you good?" he asks her on approach. "Oh, please, you in a 12-step program? You want to make amends to me?" she snaps back. It's an indication of where they stand that even a hello can be plausibly read as a dig, which it almost certainly was. Who among us hasn't felt the sting of a strategically-timed <i>are you OK</i>?</p>
      <p>"You were right," Cory tells her of the decision to name Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) as her co-anchor, powering through her reticence with compliments. "I think you're kind of a crazy genius." They're not exactly at cross-purposes here. Cory genuinely wants Bradley on their morning broadcast; Alex is less sure about Bradley but wants credit for the decision regardless. She knows there's whispers of replacing her. "Save your energy for your next kill," she tells Cory.</p>

      <p>But where Alex means for him to leave her alone, Cory sees a dare, jumping on stage and (somehow) straight-facedly crooning, "Demons are prowling everywhere, nowadays, I'll send 'em howling" in Alex's direction. He invites her up to finish the duet with him. In other words, double-dare.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the night, Alex tells her husband she doesn't have time for a drink: "I'm too busy controlling the universe." But on stage, trading lines with a song partner who is poised to fire her, the reins appear to slip. Her game face makes room for emotion. Shockingly, so does his.</p>
      <p>But just like in <i>Sweeney Todd</i>, the lyrics — "Nothin's gonna harm you. Not while I'm around" — belie the context. In the musical, the number is shared between the pie shop owner Mrs. Lovett and a young street kid, Tobias, who sees her as a mother figure. It's haunting because despite her promises, she's already planning Tobias' demise. Whether this a moment pregnant with foreshadowing or just a fun chance to see Jennifer Aniston sing a show tune, <i>The Morning Show</i> has given its Ani<i>stans</i> at least one good reason to watch.</p>
