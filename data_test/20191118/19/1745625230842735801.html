      <p>"I've never got any clothes on," the "Hot Girl Summer" rapper said.</p>
      <p>Megan Thee Stallion made no apologies about her sultry style, landing the cover of <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/3kxmkv/megan-thee-stallion-cover-the-get-up-stand-up-issue"><i>i-D Magazine</i></a> in a barely-there, not-so-booty-covering pleated skirt. She also shared the images on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5A8jm7l8c9/">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>The “Hot Girl Summer” rapper, who was decked out in a black Maison Alaïa bra and skirt combination, posed for the camera head-on, while the audience got a glimpse of her body from the side. In the winning shot, she popped out her derrière, which the skirt scarcely managed to cover. She wore her jet-black hair long, down, and stick-straight, with just a tiny flare at the bottom. Her wrists dripped in diamonds from celebrity jeweler Jacob &amp; Co., while she also sported a huge rock on her pinky finger.</p>
      <p>The black-and-white image also accentuated her makeup and nails. Her eyeshadow sparkled, while her pout was painted perfectly in a slight ombre hue. While the majority of her nails were lacquered in a gorgeous light color, only her pinky nails were painted a different, darker color — perhaps to flaunt the diamond ring on her right finger.</p>
      <p>In the article, Megan made no bones about showing off her trademark sexy, barely-there attire.</p>
      <p>“I’m from Texas and I’ve always been a big fan of booty shorts and crop tops. I’ve never got any clothes on,” she told the magazine about her style. “It’s literally how I dress and nobody can make me change if I don’t want to.”</p>

      <p>In another image from the article — the first in the series she posted on Instagram — Megan rocked a tiny bikini top that showed some serious cleavage, as well as some serious underboob. She also wore skintight denim hot pants (as the <i>Inquisitr</i> recently reported, <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5747608/megan-thee-stallion-booty-fishnet/">Megan Thee Stallion is a fan of the short shorts look</a>), as well as a luxurious faux fur shawl that draped over her raised arms. In this picture, her straight hair is slightly wind-blown, and she looks up and off to the side. She stretched her arms up to reveal just a hint of a sparkly belly button piercing, which landed right above the waist of her shorts.</p>
      <p>She also shared the video version of the black-and-white image, in which you can tell the shawl is made up of brown fur, the string bikini top is cream-colored, and her denim shorts have nearly nude sides. You can also see her knee-high boots.</p>

      <p>Megan frequently displays her bold assets with confidence. She flaunts them every which way, from twerking onstage to her many NSFW Instagram photos.</p>
