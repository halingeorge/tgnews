      <h2>On invoking UAPA against youths</h2>

      <p>Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the Assembly on Monday that the Polit Bureau (PB) of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is not like the Congress party’s high command. His party, he claimed, functioned as per the party rules.</p>
      <p>Reacting to Congress lawmaker P.T. Thomas’s comment that it was common knowledge that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala had been rapped by the CPI(M) Polit Bureau, Mr. Vijayan said, “Nothing of that sort as reported in the media took place.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Vijayan criticised the media for propagating misinformation about the decisions of the Polit Bureau meet that ended in Delhi on Sunday.</p>
      <p>What irked Mr. Vijayan was that numerous media organisations had reported that he came under fire at the Polit Bureau meeting. And the reason for him getting a dressing down was the way Mr. Vijayan’s police had invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against two young Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers in Kozhikode early this month for their alleged Maoist links.</p>
      <p>Replying to questions by V.S. Sivakumar, T.J. Vinod and others on the killing of Maoists in Wayanad, he said the government had taken steps as per the directives of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Supreme Court as to whether there were any failings on the part of the police in resorting to firing.</p>
      <p>He maintained that the police had only returned fire.</p>
      <p>The High Court has now issued a direction to the Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch, Kozhikode, to seize the guns used by the police and to sent these for forensic and ballistic examination.</p>
      <p>He said the political philosophy of Maoists was impractical and that they were hell-bent on creating conflict and disturbing peaceful living.</p>
