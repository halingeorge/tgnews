      <p>There is a significant laundry list to address with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/18/can-google-crack-cloud-gaming-stadia/">Google Stadia</a> – the Silicon Valley giant’s attempt to muscle into the $150bn (£116bn) gaming industry – but the most pressing is the most obvious: does the thing work?</p>
      <p>After all, the promise of cloud gaming is a tantalising one. Being able to stream blockbuster video games directly to a variety of screens with no dedicated hardware has the potential to, one day, significantly disrupt the most lucrative entertainment industry in the world. But it might all be for naught if the early entrants into the market fail to even get up and running.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/google-stadia-man-wants-transform-170bn-video-gaming-industry/">Google Stadia</a>, the answer is a resounding yes. And, honestly, this came as something of a surprise after months of gentle cynicism over the ability of Google’s servers to dish out blockbuster games on my often mercurial internet connection at home.</p>
      <p>But once you are playing the sprawling <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-a-seismic-achievement/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> on a phone, at 60fps, with no obvious latency or lag; it is easy to be swept away on the cloud gaming promise. But whether Google can be the one to lead the way is another matter entirely.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia streaming</h3>
      <p>Over the past few days I have played <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>, Red Dead Redemption 2 and a modest selection of games across the screens that will be available to Stadia players at launch: a 4K HDR TV via Chromecast, a Pixel phone and on PC via a Chrome browser. </p>
      <p>Even despite having to jump through an extra couple of hoops in the review program, setting up Stadia has been a relatively painless experience. The bespoke Stadia controller connects wirelessly to the Chromecast and (currently) via a USB cable to the Pixel phone and PCs.</p>

        <figcaption>With Stadia you can play Rockstar's Wild West epic Red Dead Redemption 2 on a phone... if your internet connection can handle it</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Once you are signed up, it all works remarkably smoothly between devices and you are playing within a few button presses. And, as promised, with no downloads or updates. Once I had entered my download code for a game, I could play it instantly, which felt like a minor revelation.</p>
      <p>And once I was playing, it was hard to not be impressed. On the television, I was able to play at 4K with HDR enabled the majority of the time. Occasionally it would drop to 1080p, but the transition would happen with barely an interruption. How Google Stadia adapts to adverse conditions will be key and it seems well equipped to adjust picture quality without impacting on gameplay.</p>
      <p>Most impressively, there seems very little input lag. Google were brave enough to drop in fighting game Mortal Kombat, which is the one game where you may notice the split-second difference between pressing the button and actions unfolding on screen. But MK was perfectly playable, whereas most of the other games you would not notice any difference at all. Even when the visual quality took a dip, Stadia seemed to prioritise input so that control did not take a hit.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that mileage will vary depending on your connection and wi-fi. My home internet is a relatively fast 55mbps at source, but my slightly wonky router causes that number to hover around 30mbps or less depending on where I am in the house. Google recommends 35mbps for 4K and HDR, so it was no surprise when on wi-fi Stadia would appear to be on that edge. 10mbps is the minimum for any kind of play.</p>
      <p>I also have unlimited data, but remain keenly aware that Stadia and cloud gaming will be bandwidth hungry, using up to 20GB an hour on full whack. Stadia does give you the option to limit your data usage to 4.5GB an hour by capping the visuals at 720p, which may prove handy to those players with more stringent data caps.</p>

        <figcaption>Eventually Google Stadia will stream to almost any connected device with a screen</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Retreating to the furthest corner of the house still yielded perfectly reasonable results, though with a few more hiccups. While on my PC I deliberately throttled my speed to see how Stadia dealt with the issue. It will tell you if your internet is not stable enough before playing and warns you in-game if connection is about to drop while playing.</p>
      <p>I also still managed to play Destiny 2 to a good standard on my phone while the kids were watching Netflix on the TV. Which is possibly the best recommendation I have of the tech so far.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia controller</h3>
      <p>Packed with the £119 Founder’s Edition, which is what you’ll need to play Stadia at launch, is Google’s own bespoke controller. It is a deliberately basic gizmo that feels like a hybrid between the PS4 and Xbox One controllers.</p>
      <p>But it feels pretty good in the hands, with comfortable triggers and responsive sticks. While its form is uncomplicated, the controller earns its stripes by connecting directly to the wifi itself. This no doubt helps with the impressive lack of latency and makes it easier to jump between devices when playing. I could stop playing on the TV, connect the controller to the phone and pick up where I left off. </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The Google Stadia Founder's Edition comes with a limited edition controller and a Chromecast to connect to your TV</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There are also two buttons in the middle. One can capture screenshots and video (only on the Chromecast currently) and deliver them directly to the Stadia app on your phone.</p>
      <p>The other is the Google Assistant button, a neat sounding feature which will help guide you through tricky sections in some games. But not yet, as the Google Assistant feature isn’t live yet, contributing to one of Stadia’s two most pressing launch issues.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia features</h3>
      <p>And that is that barely any of the unique functionality that Stadia will offer is available at launch. The Google Assistant, the Buddy Pass which allows you to invite a friend to try out Stadia for free, Stream Connect to bolster local multiplayer, Crowd Play that lets viewers join a streamer’s game at the touch of a button, stats sharing and even achievements are all absent. </p>
      <p>At the moment it is entirely impossible to gauge how any of these will have an impact on the Stadia offering as they just aren’t there. Right now, it’s playing a game on a select number of devices. Even wireless support for PCs and phones for the controller isn’t live yet. Most of the features have an indeterminate release too, some may appear by the end of the year, some in 2020.</p>
      <p>It is a faintly bizarre situation that leaves Stadia with (some) games to stream and nothing else. Some may not be bothered by many of these social features, but it doesn’t help Stadia’s case to differentiate itself from a traditional console.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia games</h3>
      <p>Neither will Stadia’s launch line-up. It is a relatively varied, thoroughly solid but largely uninspiring mix of 22 already released games, one exclusive and a couple of new multi-format games. Still it could be worse as, just two days before release, Google panickedly upgraded the list from a paltry 12.</p>
      <p>It perhaps says something that Destiny 2 seems to be Stadia’s flagship title, available for free with a Stadia Pro subscription. A fabulous game and, given that I can use my existing character created on PS4, the one I am likely to use Stadia for the most. </p>
      <p>Being able to dip in to Destiny on my phone for a quick blast is certainly appealing, but if a game originally released over two years ago is its greatest draw then there may be an issue.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Bungie's excellent shooter RPG Destiny 2 and all its expansions is available with a Google Stadia Pro subscription</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, is a strapping demonstration of Stadia’s potential oomph, allowing you to play Rockstar’s Wild West epic in 4K and 60fps with the right internet connection. A feat only otherwise achieved by the hardiest of gaming PCs.</p>
      <p>But again, there is a good chance that people interested in playing RDR2 have already done so. And the thought of forking over another £50 to play on Stadia will limit that potential audience.</p>
      <p>Indeed, pricing could be a real sticking point for Stadia too, with games on the service releasing at the same price as on other platforms. Not inherently disgraceful, perhaps, but the issue of ownership rears its head as a purchase leaves the buyer with access to the game but no disc or download file to show for it.</p>
      <p>Throw in the fact that you can get the majority of these games at a reduced price on Amazon or at the local Tesco and its clear there are financial and psychological hurdles for early adopters. The one exclusive is Tequila Works’ Gylt, a decent surrealist teen horror indie but not a game going to attract new players in droves.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia verdict</h3>
      <p>This all leaves Stadia is a curious situation. The streaming itself is a genuine technical revelation, to the point where it is often difficult to differentiate between playing on Stadia and native hardware. This is no mean feat, but everything else about Stadia today screams of a product ready for trial dressed up as a commercial release.</p>
      <p>Missing features, an uninspiring launch line-up and only availability on select platforms all point to an unfinished platform.</p>
      <p>Google were clearly keen to get Stadia to market, in the hope that word of its technical brilliance will carry it through to later mainstream success. That may still happen, of course, but as a service right now it is difficult to determine just who Stadia is for.</p>
      <p>Early tech adopters will be impressed by the streaming, no doubt, but the lack of new games and promised features will be off-putting. And the traditional pricing model still seems a baffling decision, particularly in light of Microsoft’s confirmation that it will tie its own streaming platform Xcloud to its impressive Game Pass subscription service.</p>
      <p>An intriguing contradiction, then. Google has made me a believer that cloud gaming will be an integral part of gaming’s future, but if it wants Stadia to be a part of it, there is much work to be done. </p>
