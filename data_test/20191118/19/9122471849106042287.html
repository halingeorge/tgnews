      <h1>Injury Update For Pittsburgh Steelers RB James Conner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:38:21+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Pittsburgh Steelers running back James Conner left Thursday’s loss to the Cleveland Browns after re-aggravating a shoulder injury. Conner was one of four Steelers to go down in the first half alone.</p>
      <p>The third-year pro had already missed two games this season due to his ailing shoulder. Fortunately, it looks like Conner dodged a major bullet this time.</p>
      <p>According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Conner’s injury is not worse than it had been before he played on Thursday. He may be able to play this Sunday, but it is too early to tell.</p>

      <p>Conner leads Pittsburgh with 390 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the season. He also has 30 receptions for 242 yards and a pair of scores.</p>
      <p>Jaylen Samuels will receive most of the reps if Conner can’t go against Cincinnati. He carried five times for 26 yards against the Browns.</p>
      <p>At 5-5, the Steelers are still in the AFC playoff mix. However, they probably need to win at least four of their final six games to reach the postseason.</p>
