      <h2>The news has caused fresh worries for steel workers in Wales</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:50:06+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:50</time> by <a rel="author">Benjamin Wright, Sion Barry</a></address>
      <p>Tata Steel has announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs across its operations in Europe.</p>
      <p>Bosses at the steel giant said the proposals came as they were "urgently" trying to improve the firm's finances.</p>
      <p>Two thirds of the jobs losses are expected to be office-based or "white collar" roles.</p>
      <p>Details of where the jobs will be shed have not been announced. However, the development has caused fresh worries for steel workers in Wales - especially those at the plant in Port Talbot.</p>
      <p>Welsh Government economy minister Ken Skates said he wanted to meet with officials from the company to establish what it meant for workers in Wales.</p>
      <p>He said: " Today’s news is very disappointing and reflects the extremely challenging environment faced by steel producers across Europe, but particularly in the UK, where energy prices are much higher. At this very worrying time for Tata Steel employees and their families, we will do everything in our power to support them."</p>

      <p>Tata Europe has a workforce of 21,500.</p>
      <p>In the UK it employs around 8,000, with 5,000 in Wales.</p>
      <p>Tata said it couldn't say at this stage how many jobs in Wales could be lost.</p>
      <p>It added that proposals will be discussed with employees and trade unions first.</p>
      <p>The announcement to cut jobs in Europe comes 10 weeks after the steel giant announced plans to close two UK operations with the loss of 400 jobs, blaming a failure to sell off its loss-making Orb Electrical Steels business in Newport, South Wales.</p>
      <p>Tata officials said it was important to make sure the European business took the action to safeguard its long term future.</p>
      <p>Henrik Adam, CEO of Tata Steel in Europe, said: "We plan to change how we work together to enable better cooperation and faster decision-making. This will help us become self-sustaining and cash positive in the face of unprecedented severe market conditions, enabling us to lead the way towards a carbon-neutral future.”</p>
      <p>As well as cutting jobs, the firm hopes to bolster its finances by increasing sales, using more "data and advanced analytics" to improve its production processes and reducing procurement costs.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said the latter could be achieved "through smarter sourcing and strengthening cooperation with companies within the Tata Steel group".</p>
      <p>In a joint statement, Aberavon parliamentary candidate Stephen Kinnock and Labour AM David Rees described the news as a devastating blow to the workforce and the wider community.</p>
      <p>They said: "It is very disappointing that the statement issued by Tata Steel today contains so little detail. They refer to an 'estimated reduction in employee numbers of up to 3,000 across Tata Steel Europe’s operations....but they provide absolutely no information about where the focus of those job losses will be.</p>
      <p>"Will they be in the Netherlands or the UK? And if they are to be in the UK what will that mean for South Wales and our Port Talbot steelworks? Tata Steel should remember that these are real people with families to look after, they are not just numbers on a spreadsheet.</p>
      <p>"The workforce has given continued commitment to Tata and Tata must now confirm to its employees that their dedication and hard work will not be ignored or discarded."</p>
      <p>In the first six months of its current financial year- starting April 2019 - Tata Steel Europe reported a 90% decrease in its earnings before interest and tax to £31 million.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Indian-owned business confirmed it had walked away from a proposed merger of its European steel operations with that of German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp.</p>
      <p>There was speculation that as part of any approval process, and reducing its market dominant position, it would have looked to offload its Trostre operation.</p>
      <p>Tata Steel has two steel packaging plants in Trostre and Duffel in Belgium which employ over 1,000 workers combined making food and aerosol cans.</p>
