      <p>Big K.R.I.T. is finishing the decade strong. In 2010, he delivered a mixtape that elevated the medium in the form of <a href="https://www.datpiff.com/BIG-KRIT-Krit-Wuz-Here-mixtape.117453.html"><i>K.R.I.T. Wuz Here</i></a>. Earlier this year, he offered fans another high-level album in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1KvZT4NZm69EkOym8rLqW1?si=U0ACibVXQ5GmB-n6WLmL_w"><i>K.R.I.T. IZ HERE</i></a>. It was an appropriate bookend in a decade where the MC/producer left an indelible mark on the Rap genre.</p>
      <p>Interviewed on camera at <i>AFH TV</i> <a href="https://www.afhtv.com/making-the-music/season:1/videos/big-k-r-i-t-describes-the-evolution-experimentation-for-k-r-i-t-iz-here">(and currently available for all to watch)</a>, Big K.R.I.T speaks on getting out of his comfort zone with the production on his latest album. Rico Love, DJ Khalil, and longtime Timbaland collaborator Danja took the reigns, with Krizzle doing just one track. With extra space on his plate, the 33-year-old Mississippi native focused on writing some of his most prolific bars yet.</p>

      <p>At the 8:00 mark, K.R.I.T says, “[I felt] challenged as a writer for the first time. It took a lot for me to get out of my comfort zone with that, but it allowed me to experiment with what I got to say and a little bit more. I think it shows on this album, which is gonna make it difficult for the next album.”</p>
      <p>He goes on to say, “I know what kick I wanna use. What snare I wanna use. Samples I heard or Shazamed. I’ma flip it my way. I get in with these producers, and they might be aware of my music. They might see me in a different place or different space, or they might be like ‘Man, this would be a great record for you to do with this person.’ What I have to do is find that humility in myself as an artist to collaborate. It’s a collective effort to make something great and us as rappers, we do it all the time. We do features. We do hooks. But the producer in me has never been as open to like just ‘Hey man! What kick you think [works here?] What hook you think? What snare you think?’ This is the first time I’m like, ‘I got the sample. I don’t know how to flip it. I know you know how to play instruments. What you think about this?’ Then, we create something grand. So now my dream still comes true because I viewed this sample, for I have been listening for four, five years. I’m working with the producers I want to work with, and the artist in me gets to write over it. It becomes <i>K.R.I.T IZ Here</i>. It becomes this record. It becomes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQAU6z856Ks">‘Make it Easy.’</a>”</p>
