      <p>The Toronto Maple Leafs have called up Pierre Engvall and placed the injured Trevor Moore on IR.</p>

      <p>With Moore officially on IR to provide the roster space to add a player to the 23-man roster, he will have to stay out of action for seven days, but that will be counted from the day after he left the game against the Bruins.</p>

      <p>Engvall is waiver-exempt, and can appear in 70 NHL games before that expires. He counts against the now-gigantic LTIR pool for $925,000, making him a difficult player to fit on the roster when all players are healthy without dropping to only 20 players. Now is a good time to have a look at him in the NHL, since salary amount isn’t an issue right now.</p>
      <p>Engvall was drafted in 2014, 188th overall in the seventh round where the Leafs find all their players. He is 23, and has been playing regularly at centre this year on the Marlies, but he is more usually a winger in his higher-level pro career.</p>
      <p>He had a good year on the Marlies last season after a very positive season in the SHL. His play this season has been even better, and he co-leads the team in points with Pontus Aberg. Engvall, Aberg, Jeremy Bracco and Egor Korshkov are the only players to have appeared in all 15 games for the Marlies.</p>
      <p>While Engvall’s role on the Marlies has been on a scoring line, his primary role for HV71, in his first and only year in the SHL was as a depth forward, and he played that role extremely well. It’s that versatility, which can be hard to find, which gives him a chance to make an impression in the NHL.</p>
