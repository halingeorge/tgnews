      <h1>Dragon Quest Builders 2 puts RPG in your Minecraft, and it hits Steam next month</h1>

        <b>While Dragon Quest Builders initially seemed like a cynical effort to cash in on the popularity of Minecraft, the game turned out to be an absolute delight – and its sequel made the peanut-butter-and-chocolate formula even better. While the games have been the exclusive domain of consoles up until this point, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is finally coming to Steam on December 10.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Your patience is paying off, too, as the PC edition of DQB2 will include all of the DLC previously released with the console season pass. That means you’re getting new areas, over 100 additional recipes for new structure and, outfits, and fishing with loads of aquatic animals to catch. If you like to purchase early, you can pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1072420/DRAGON_QUEST_BUILDERS_2/">Steam</a> for $59.99 / £49.99 / €59.99.</p>
      <p>If you’ve not played Dragon Quest Builders, it’s basically Minecraft: The RPG. You’ve still got loads of options to build in and explore a blocky open-world as you see fit, but there’s a more directed narrative and quirky characters to add extra life to the proceedings.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the online co-op returns here, too.</p>
