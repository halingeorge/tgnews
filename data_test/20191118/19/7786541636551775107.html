      <p><b>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)</b> - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó is struggling to draw protesters into the streets after calling for daily demonstrations to drive President Nicolás Maduro from power.</p>
      <p>A few dozen Guaidó supporters scuffled with security forces on Monday in Caracas, falling far short of what the opposition had hoped to achieve.</p>
      <p>At a large demonstration on Saturday, Guaidó appealed for sustained protests against the government.</p>
      <p>School teacher Yldemar Acevedo joined a small gathering of protesters on Monday. She says she is determined to continue demonstrating.</p>
      <p>Another Caracas resident, Ofelia Briceño, says she won't protest again until the opposition has a clear plan for luring the military away from Maduro.</p>
      <p>Guaidó drew huge crowds when he declared himself interim president in January. Many thought change was imminent, but Maduro has kept power.</p>
