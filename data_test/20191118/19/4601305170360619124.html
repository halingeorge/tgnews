      <p>After trying out a lot of different scrub brushes, I think the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Xuy5Ma">OXO Good Grips scrub brush</a> is the best. I prefer this palm-style brush to brushes with a handle because I can really bear down on the pots and pans. It's comfortable to hold and the bristles hold up well to rough treatment. I wish the brush was available via Subscribe and Save, because I'd get a new one every three months.</p>
