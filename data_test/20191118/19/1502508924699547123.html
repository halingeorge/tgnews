      <h1>Oil prices fall almost 2% on uncertainty over US-China trade talks</h1>
      <h2>Brent crude futures settled at $62.44 a barrel, down 86 cents, or 1.4 per cent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:54:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil">Oil </a>prices fell more than 1 per cent on Monday, erasing much of last week's gains and tumbling alongside US stocks on uncertainty over a trade deal between the United States and China.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures settled at $62.44 a barrel, down 86 cents, or 1.4 per cent. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended 67 cents, or 1.2 per cent, lower at $57.05 a barrel. Both benchmarks posted their second straight weekly gain last week, with Brent rising 1.3 per cent and WTI up 0.8 per cent.</p>
      <p>Wall Street's three main stock indexes also fell from last week's record highs following a report that stoked concerns a US-China trade deal might not get through, which pushed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil">oil </a>prices lower, analysts said.</p>
      <p>"Crude has become highly reactive to whichever way the wind is blowing in the (US-China) trade talks. When it falters, prices get punished," said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. "This headwind of slack demand growth keeps holding us back."</p>
      <p>The 16-month trade war between the world's two biggest economies has slowed global growth, prompting analysts to lower forecasts for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil">oil </a>demand growth and raising concerns that a supply glut could develop in 2020.</p>
      <p>China and the United States had "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level call on Saturday, state media Xinhua reported on Sunday, but it gave few other details.</p>
      <p>On Monday, CNBC quoted a Chinese government source saying the mood in Beijing about a trade deal was pessimistic due to US President Donald Trump's reluctance to roll back on tariffs.</p>
      <p>"The souring trade situation has put a halt to the rally," said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York, adding crude prices had risen earlier in the session but faded when New York <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>opened.</p>
      <p>Expectations of lower seasonal demand for gasoline in the United States also weighed on oil prices, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.</p>
      <p>Concerns about plentiful crude supplies in 2020 weighed on the market. US crude stockpiles were seen rising 1.1 million barrels last week, which would be the fourth straight weekly build, a preliminary Reuters poll showed.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said last week it expected demand for its oil to fall in 2020, supporting a view that there is a case for the group and other producers like Russia - collectively known as OPEC+ - to maintain limits on production.</p>
      <p>OPEC+ is due to discuss output policy at a meeting on Dec. 5-6 in Vienna. Their existing production deal runs until March.</p>
