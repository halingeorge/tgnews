      <h1>House investigating if Trump lied to Mueller during Russia probe</h1>

      <p>The House of Representatives is investigating whether President Trump lied to special counsel Robert Mueller in written answers he provided in the Russia probe, the House’s general counsel said in federal court Monday according to reports.</p>
      <p>“Did the President lie? Was the President not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?” House general counsel Douglas Letter asked the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit about why the House now needs access to grand jury material Mueller collected in his 22-month investigation, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/mueller-grand-jury-material-urgently-needed-for-impeachment-inquiry-congress-tells-court/2019/11/17/e797aa5c-0173-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html">the Washington Post said.</a></p>
      <p>“There is evidence, very sadly, that the president might have provided untruthful answers,” Letter also said, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The House’s arguments Monday draw new focus to whether the commander-in-chief had lied to Mueller following revelations at Trump pal Roger Stone’s trial.</p>
      <p>Ex-Trump deputy campaign chair Rick Gates testified that Trump and Stone talked about information that was coming that could help the campaign in mid-2016, at a time when <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/roger-stone-supporters-push-petition-for-presidential-pardon/">Stone was trying to get secret details</a> about the stolen Democratic documents WikiLeaks had.</p>
      <p>Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/03/rudy-giuliani-consulted-paul-manafort-to-bolster-his-ukraine-theory/">now doing time in a federal prison</a> — also apparently told the Mueller grand jury what Trump’s tried to approach WikiLeaks had been in 2016, according to the Mueller report.</p>
      <p>But Trump asserted in his written statements to the special counsel that he didn’t recall discussing WikiLeaks with Stone.</p>
      <p>The House hasn’t been able to learn what Manafort told the grand jury, which Mueller apparently described in his report.</p>
      <p>In Mueller’s report, grand jury details are redacted related to a sentence describing Manafort speaking with Trump after WikiLeaks’ first release, in July 2016, the network reported.</p>
      <p>Mueller concluded that there was insufficient evidence that Trump colluded with Russians prior to the 2016 election, but added that he could not clear him of obstruction of justice.</p>
