      <h1>Shiv Sena workers protest over Metro 3 work at Girgaum, three held</h1>
      <h2>‘We are fed up with traffic congestion, noise pollution, movement of trucks’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:57:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Tanvi-Deshpande-19168/" target="_blank">Tanvi Deshpande</a></address>
      <p>Shiv Sainiks staged a protest at Girgaum on Monday morning over the ongoing work for the Metro 3 which is leading to congestion on Jagannath Shankar Sheth Road. They have alleged frequent traffic jams and noise pollution in the area due to the construction activity and demanded that movement of trucks be restricted to night.</p>
      <p>The 33.5 km underground Metro 3 line, connecting Colaba-Bandra to Seepz, has resulted in several people being relocated out of Girgaum. Residents of Kalbadevi and Girgaum have been facing traffic congestion on JSS Road due to the ongoing work, movement and parking of trucks, and have also complained of noise due to loading and unloading done at night.</p>
      <p>“People in this area cannot sleep at night due to the noise. In the daytime, school children cannot walk on the road properly with dumpers plying and barely any space left for pedestrians. How are these trucks being allowed in the city despite a ban in the daytime? Neither police nor MMRCL is doing anything about it. After our protest we also met the police and all stakeholders. We have given MMRCL a week’s time to resolve the issues,” said Shiv Sena’s local leader Pandurang Sakpal.</p>
      <p>Some Sena workers damaged a contractor’s vehicle while the protest was being held near Thakurdwar petrol pump, according to the police. Three workers were arrested on rioting and other charges.</p>
      <p>Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Pranay Ashok said, “We have arrested three Sena workers under relevant sections of the IPC, including 146 (rioting), 336 (endangering life or personal safety of others) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others).”</p>
      <p>The protesters shouted slogans against the MMRDA, the State-run firm implementing the project, and private developer DB Realty.</p>
      <p>They broke the glass of a dumper belonging to one of the metro contractors while it was parked outside the Charni Road Station, the police said.</p>
