      <h1>You’re still broke after “Nothing I Get” hit – Awal launches fresh attack on Fameye</h1>

      <p>Awal has once again unleashed his venom on Fameye after the latter revealed in an interview that he(Awal) is desperate for fame adding that he has not taken any money from him.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, Awal in a self-recorded video revealed that the <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/awal-calls-fameye-fraudster-after-chopping-his-gh%C2%A2500-failing-to-show-on-set-for-video-shoot/">‘Nothing I Get’ hitmaker charged him GHC500 to shoot a music video with him but failed to honour his part of the bargain when he got the money.</a></p>
      <p>According to Awal in the video, Fameye verbally attacked him when he was called to come on set to shoot his part pf the video because he is delaying their work.</p>
      <p>It seems Awal is still not pleased with Fameye’s response as he has launched a fresh attack on Fameye over their GH500 beef.</p>
      <p>According to Awal, Fameye is a greedy artiste who’s still broke despite having a hit song adding that upon all the monies he’s gotten from the shows played, Fameye has not even been able to buy a car and only relies on Uber for commuting around.</p>
