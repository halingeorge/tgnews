      <p>There is an urgent need for overhauling current teaching and training methods and contents in taxonomy - the scientific branch concerned with classification - at all levels, according to experts.</p>
      <p>The observation came in a declaration made at the 29th annual conference of Indian Association of Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT) held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI), Palode.</p>
      <p>The future of taxonomic practice and research depends on approaches involving multiple agencies, which range from the use of traditional knowledge-based approaches to classical taxonomy to the use of modern next-generation sequencing tools, the declaration stated.</p>
      <p>It further called for the establishment of a ‘National Taxonomy Initiative,’ which builds on past experiences of both the Government and others, by the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) in collaboration with all State Biodiversity Boards (SBB). “Partnerships with private sector, civil society organizations should be urgently explored to digitise, disseminate and discover more diversity,” it added.</p>
      <p>A. Mao, Director, Botanical Survey of India, inaugurated the conference. A symposium on ‘Modern trends in biosystematics of angiosperms’ also was held</p>
