      <h1>Transfer plans, investment and Rooney - your key Derby County questions answered</h1>
      <h2>You asked and we answered on a range of topics in our latest Derby County Q&amp;A</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Nicholson</a></address>
      <p>We hosted our weekly <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> Q&amp;A on Monday afternoon, answering your questions on a range of topics.</p>
      <p>Here is a full rundown of the questions put to <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county?ghgghgghggh">chief football writer Steve Nicholson</a> , and his answers ...</p>
      <p><b>Antony Jackson asks:</b> Is there going to be much money available for possible investment in transfers in January and are we likely to see any outgoings?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Budgets, or how much money is available, is never something clubs divulge, Antony, because providing other clubs with such information would not help in transfer talks.</p>
      <p>I see Derby adding to their squad in January, yes, and I also see possible outgoings.</p>
      <p><b>Grapecollective asks:</b> Centre back is an obvious one, but if you had to pick two other positions to strengthen which would you pick?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> I would look at a right-sided attacking player/winger because the role has been up for grabs since Harry Wilson's loan spell ended following the play-off final last season.</p>
      <p>Goals and creativity is another area of the side to be considered, but hopefully Wayne Rooney can boost Derby's attacking threat when he arrives in January.</p>
      <p>As you say, centre back is the area that needs bolstering.</p>
      <p><b>Lewis Boerder asks:</b> Latest on Acosta to Derby?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> He is not a player Derby are looking at, I understand.</p>

      <p><b>Jon Boyle asks:</b> Do you think Louis Sibley is good enough for first-team football and who do you think he would be most likely to replace?</p>
      <p><b>Jack Couchman asks:</b> When will Sibley get a go?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Louie Sibley has been catching the eye for some time and he looks to have a bright future. He plays with great drive, he carries the ball and commits players, is a goal threat and has tenacity.</p>
      <p>It is very tempting to put him in because that will tell us if he is ready, but I would guard against that at this stage. The right time for him to step up on a regular basis will come, it will become obvious, as it was with Will Hughes. I think what we will see with Sibley, as we have with Jason Knight, is him being in and around the squad while continuing to develop in the under-23s and then knocking on the door next season.</p>

      <p><b>Mawgen Hogg asks:</b> Are we looking at any free transfers to bolster the centre-back issues or we sticking with what we have?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Derby will look at the centre-back position in the January window, Mawgen.</p>
      <p><b>Patrick Aherne asks:</b> Do you think the scouting system needs overhauling, especially in Europe? There are is some interesting players, playing for lesser nations like Luxembourg, San Marino which might be not top Premiership players but might be good Championship players.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Deeper understanding/knowledge of Derby's scouting system and network is needed before comment can be made on whether or not it needs "overhauling". What I will say is that Phillip Cocu is very likely to have his own thoughts/contacts when it comes to players in Europe and this will have added to the scouting set up.</p>
      <p><b>John Ernest Whitehead asks:</b> Is there any more news on investment at the club?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Chairman Mel Morris said recently that the club is "close" to securing new investment. I understand discussions/dialogue are ongoing and things could be in place before the end of the year.</p>
      <p><b>Julie Osbiston asks:</b> Will we be hearing about the new investment soon, and what difference do you think it will make to our club, and will Mel (Morris) stay on?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Could hear before the end of the year, I understand. What difference will it make? Well this is what Mel Morris said recently: "We have been looking for investment and we are close to trying to get something sorted out on that front, which is important. I have always believed that it's not the best structure to have a single person at the club because it's expensive, but also because you need a balance. So we have been looking for the right person."</p>
      <p>As DerbyshireLive has reported previously, it is set to be part-investment and not a takeover. The chairman's words point to the investment being a 'partnership', with Mel Morris staying on which is something he has said he is very keen to do.</p>

      <p><b>Paul Mottershead asks:</b> Thai investment coming in? Any truth?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Not as far as I am aware.</p>
      <p><b>Antony Jackson asks:</b> How do you think we will line up when Rooney arrives? Who will he displace in the 11?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Phillip Cocu has said he sees Wayne Rooney playing as a No.9 or No.10. If you think that Chris Martin, Martyn Waghorn and Jack Marriott have all filled the '9' role this season, and Tom Lawrence, Kieran Dowell, Jamie Paterson and Duane Holmes have played as a '10', then it is not simply a case of Rooney displacing one individual. What Rooney will offer is a quality option in either role, and possibly a midfield role.</p>
      <p><b>The Ramswriter Podcast asks:</b> Do you think Cocu will rely on his own knowledge of players that he will want to bring in since the summer ones, apart from Bielik and Clarke, haven’t really impressed?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> The January transfer window is a difficult window for clubs, as Derby have found at times over the years. Phillip Cocu has his thoughts/plans in place for the window, yes.</p>
      <p><b>Nigel Whitehouse asks:</b> Do Derby scout in Africa? Even in Uganda, West Brom do, well training exercises, but the same thing.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> I don't know the answer to that Nigel. I will attempt to find out.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Jack Couchman asks:</b> Can we play Andre Wisdom at centre half?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> I have said, and written a number of times that I see Andre Wisdom as an option at centre back. If Krystian Bielik is to remain in central midfield, then Wisdom, George Evans and Craig Forsyth (once ready for a first-team return) have to be considered as options given the recent injury to Matt Clarke and the situation with Richard Keogh. As I said earlier, Derby are likely to bolster the position in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p><b>Nick Headley asks:</b> Despite the result at Forest, there are encouraging signs since the change of formation to the diamond and two strikers. Do you think it is important to keep Bielik at the base of the diamond and play Evans, Forsyth or Wisdom at centre-half?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> I would have put George Evans at centre back when he came on for the injured Matt Clarke against Forest, and left Krystian Bielik in central midfield where he was having an influence.</p>
      <p>I believe Bielik needs to be allowed to settle into one position or another - midfield or the centre of the defence. I think he would benefit from growing into one of those positions.</p>
      <p>However, sometimes it is about needs must, and injuries at centre back have resulted in Derby having to shuffle the pack.</p>

      <p><b>George Glover asks:</b> Any injury updates on Malone, Huddlestone and Clarke. How many more weeks/months? Doesn't look good for Clarke.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Derby have yet to issue an update on Matt Clarke, George, but it does not look positive for him, as manager Phillip Cocu said following the defeat by Nottingham Forest. The centre-back looks set for a spell on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>I will be checking on the latest on Tom Huddlestone and Scott Malone this week and ahead of the Preston game.</p>
      <p><b>Sachin-Gill asks:</b> How much transfer activity do you think we will see in January in terms of ins and outs?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> I think Derby will look at two or three positions in the team. I could also see there being 'outs' as well, although that very much depends on interest from other clubs.</p>
      <p><b>Brightsideram asks:</b> Are the rumours about the ground redevelopment true?</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Very much depends on what you mean by 'redevelopment'.</p>
      <p>In the financial year 2017-18, Pride Park Stadium was sold to a separate company owned by Rams chairman Mel Morris.</p>
      <p>It was made clear when the latest accounts were published in April that the stadium could be "utilised for other larger scale entertainment events" moving forward in order to "generate more from other activities outside of football - with technology, with entertainment, etc."</p>
