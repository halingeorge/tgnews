      <p>iVerify is a security toolkit for iPhones and iPads. It can check the security of your device to see if modifications have taken place, such as jailbreaking or other forms of hacking. It also has a Safari content blocker.</p>
      <blockquote>iVerify is your personal security toolkit. Use iVerify to manage the security of your iOS device and detect modifications to your smartphone. iVerify makes it easy to manage the security of your accounts and online presence with simple instructional guides.</blockquote>
      <p>I’m curious to see how long it will last. I’ve used two similar apps in the past that offered the same modification detection, but both were removed from the App Store. I don’t know if it was Apple’s doing or if each company independently removed it. <b>App Store: US$4.99</b></p>
