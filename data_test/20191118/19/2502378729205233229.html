      <h1>Kylie Jenner Made $600 Million By Selling Major Stake In Kylie Cosmetics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:01:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nylon.com/author/allison-stubblebine" target="_blank">Allison Stubblebine</a></address>
      <h3>That's a lot of lip kits</h3>
      <p>Kylie Jenner just traded a major stake in her namesake beauty brand for a sweet, sweet payday. According to the <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/beauty/coty-buys-majority-stake-in-kylie-jenners-kylie-cosmetics?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">Business of Fashion</a>, Coty has purchased 51 percent of Kylie Cosmetics for $600 million, valuing Jenner's company at a whopping $1.2 billion. Jenner will remain in charge of "creative efforts and communication," per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/coty-buys-majority-stake-in-kylie-cosmetic-line-for-600-million">Bloomberg</a>, but Coty will hold overall responsibility for the company.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Back in March, Forbes named Jenner the <a href="https://nylon.com/kylie-jenner-self-made-billionaire">youngest self-made billionaire</a>, a title which only makes sense if you forget she was born into extreme wealth and privilege. Now, we can make that billionaire-and-a-half. Apparently, the deal to purchase majority holdings in Kylie Cosmetics was made in all cash, which is quite the chunk of change to hand over.</p>
      <p>Given that Jenner will remain on in a creative capacity, one can assume the brand will continue in a similar fashion. According to Bloomberg reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/KimBhasin/status/1196442555589840896">Kim Bhasin</a>, Coty aims to expand the brand's presence internationally, bringing already-successful drops — such as Jenner's <a href="https://nylon.com/kylie-jenner-balmain-kylie-cosmetics">recent collaboration with Balmain</a> or <a href="https://nylon.com/kylie-jenner-money-collection-response">widely memed money-themed collection</a> — further outside of the United States. So, although Jenner may no longer own a majority of the company, she's still well on her way toward (beauty) world domination.</p>
