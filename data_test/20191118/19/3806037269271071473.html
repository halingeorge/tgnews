      <h1>Tiktok Has Been Downloaded 1.5 Billion Times</h1>
      <h2>The app is currently outperforming Instagram.</h2>

      <p>According to new analytical data, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/tiktok">TikTok</a> has hit 1.5 billion total downloads across the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/app-store">App Store</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/google-play">Google Play</a>, with the app hitting the 1 billion milestones earlier this February. Reports from analytics site <i><a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-1-5-billion">Sensor Tower</a></i> states the app has raked in 614 million downloads so far this year and mainly has gained traction in India, who made up 31% of this year’s downloads.</p>
      <p>TikTok is becoming a huge competitor for <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/facebook">Facebook</a>—especially <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/instagram">Instagram</a>—who is vying for the same young audience as TikTok. <i>Sensor Tower</i> reports TikTok as the only app in the top five most downloaded apps that aren’t owned by the tech giant and is outpacing Instagram in terms of downloads this year by 238 million downloads.</p>
      <p>Facebook’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> is desperately trying to repackage TikTok’s short-form video gimmick, introducing a standalone video-sharing app called Lasso last year and marketing it towards places TikTok weren’t available. Earlier this month, Instagram began testing a Reels feature in Brazil, which has been criticized as being a clone app of TikTok.</p>
      <p>In other tech news, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/apple-smart-glasses-augmented-reality-replace-iphone-report">Apple is reportedly replacing iPhones with smart glasses in roughly a decade</a>.</p>
