      <h1>De Blasio formally guarantees pay hikes for pre-K educators</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:24:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author">Selim Algar</a></address>
      <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson formalized the deal they struck with early education teacher unions <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/09/city-boosts-pay-for-pre-k-workers-with-15-million-deal/">guaranteeing pay hikes over the next three years</a>, officials announced Monday.</p>
      <p>The accord with District Councils 37 and 1701 will boost salaries for certified pre-K educators by $17,000 to $20,000, depending on their level of education — putting them on par with Department of Education staffers.</p>
      <p>“This City Council believes strongly in tackling pay inequities among city workers, and as part of that commitment we promised to address the gap between community-based early childhood educators and their Education Department counterparts,” Johnson said in a statement.</p>
      <p>By October of 2021, early education teachers with a bachelor’s degree will pull in $61,070 while those holding a master’s will make $68,652.</p>
      <p>The unions had argued that paltry pay contributed to a 30 percent turnover rate for early education workers, far higher than the 10 percent rate for DOE teachers.</p>
      <p>“Early childhood education opens up a world of possibilities for our youngest New Yorkers and their families,” de Blasio said in a statement.</p>
