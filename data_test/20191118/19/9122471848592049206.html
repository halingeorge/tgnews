      <h1>Michigan Lineman Rips Michigan State Player For Dirty Hit On Shea Patterson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:13:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>There are always high tensions when Michigan and Michigan State battle it out for the Paul Bunyan trophy. Sometimes, those rivalry emotions evoke unsportsmanlike penalties or otherwise “dirty” plays.</p>
      <p>This past Saturday’s edition of the classic Big Ten rivalry brought out several unnecessary after-the-play fouls. Shea Patterson was the latest victim of said unnecessary fouls over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Michigan State defensive lineman Jacub Panasiuk <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/michigan-state-player-ejected-for-dirty-hit-on-michigan-qb-shea-patterson">delivered a late blow</a> on the Wolverines QB, sparking an ejection. Michigan offensive lineman Jon Runyan had some harsh words for the Spartans’ ejected player on Monday during a media session.</p>
      <blockquote>“I didn’t see it at the time. I always knew that No. 96 [Jacub Panisiuk] was kind of a dirty player, him and his brother,” Runyan said. “I really don’t care too much for them … I thought it was disgusting what he did. Completely unnecessary.”</blockquote>
      <p>You can check out the rest of his comments in the tweet below.</p>

      <p>The Wolverines and Spartans may have settled things on the field last Saturday. But it’s clear emotions are still running high after Michigan’s blowout win.</p>
      <p>Panisiuk’s late hit was completely uncalled for and doesn’t belong in the sport of football. Runyan is simple protecting his quarterback and calling out the Spartans’ defensive lineman for the dirty play.</p>
      <p>Michigan gets back to work this week as the Wolverines prepare to face Indiana this upcoming Saturday.</p>
