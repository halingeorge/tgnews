      <h1>Kejriwal challenges Paswan, asks him to test Delhi’s water</h1>
      <h2>CM says 98.57% samples taken by govt. since January have passed the test</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:56:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:56</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Of the 1.55 lakh water samples tested by the Delhi government since January this year, 98.57% passed the test, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday in response to a study released by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), which stated that Delhi’s water was the most unsafe among 21 State capitals.</p>
      <p>The CM said that only 1.43% of the samples were found to be unsatisfactory and it was well within the World Health Organization’s limit of 5%.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan had accused the CM of doing politics over the issue and had challenged him to name people for a team, comprising city and central officials, to test the water. Speaking in Lok Sabha during Zero Hour, the Minister said that water supplied by the Delhi Jal Board was not fit for drinking.</p>
      <p>In response, the CM said: “I challenge, you [Mr. Paswan] to test the water, we will also test it. I invite Mr. Paswan to come along with us and take 1,500-2,000 samples.”</p>
      <p>He added that the Centre had taken only 11 samples for their study from Delhi and ideally 2,000 samples should have been taken.</p>
      <p>“On September 26, 2019, Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had said that Delhi’s water quality is better than European standards. From 20 locations in Delhi, the Union Water Ministry collected samples to come to this conclusion. All were better than European standards. These are his words, not mine.”</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Union Minister Harsh Vardhan had said in a tweet that in the “name of free water, Kejriwal is making people of Delhi drink poison”. “It is very unfortunate that the Minister is generating fear among the people about Delhi’s water, which is good,” Mr. Kejriwal said.</p>
      <p>The CM also hit out at the Centre for allegedly not listing a Bill for regularisation of unauthorised colonies in the winter session of Parliament.</p>
      <p>“The Centre always used to give irrelevant excuses for not clearing our proposal. After continuous pressure from our government and the people of Delhi, the Centre announced the regularisation process just before the Assembly elections. Not listing it in the government’s agenda for the upcoming winter session exposes their true intention,” said Mr. Kejriwal.</p>
      <p>“But until you actually get the registry, do not believe anyone. We have already been misled once using provisional certificates. Now they are trying website numbers,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Aam Aadmi Party said it will launch a protest march to Parliament if regularisation of unauthorised colonies is not done by the Centre.</p>
