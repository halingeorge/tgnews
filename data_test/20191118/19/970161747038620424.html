      <p>A former soldier who fell for paedophile hunter sting operations twice in a row after walking free from prison has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Anthony Nendick, 36, sent sexual messages to a fictitious 13-year-old girl played by an adult from the ‘Children’s Warriors’ group.</p>
      <p>He had left prison just two weeks earlier, having been released nine months into a 16-month sentence for attempting to incite a child to take part in a sexual activity.</p>
      <p>Nendick represented himself at Teesside Crown Court, where jurors heard of his string of online child sex offences <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> back five years.</p>
      <p>He was given a three-year community order in 2014 after pleading guilty to inciting a real underage girl to engage in sexual activity.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Jo Kidd said Nendick sent pictures of himself to the girl online, encouraging her to do the same, but was arrested after she told her mother.</p>

      <p>Several years later he began sending sordid messages to a decoy 13-year-old girl on social media, the court heard.</p>

      <p>Jurors were told how he encouraged the stooge to watch pornography and touch herself, and sent an image of him doing the same.</p>
      <p>The trial resulted in the 16-month sentence handed to him in January this year.</p>
      <p>Two weeks after his release on September 13, he messaged another decoy 13-year-old girl, telling her to touch herself and that he wanted to have sex with her, jurors heard.</p>
      <p>He gave his address to the decoy on request, only to be confronted by Children’s Warriors and the police.</p>
      <p>Nendick, of Middlesbrough, admitted to again attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity between September 27 and October 2.</p>
      <p>He also admitted breaching a sex offender order by not telling authorities of the phone he used for the offences.</p>

      <p>He refused to explain himself after Judge Deborah Sherwin questioned him on telling a probation officer he had no sexual interest in children.</p>
      <p>Judge Sherwin told him: ‘You put your needs before those of any child.</p>
      <p>‘Is there anything you would like to say to me by way of mitigation?’ she added.</p>
      <p>Nendick replied: ‘No, your Honour. No.’</p>
      <p>Sentencing, Judge Sherwin said: ‘I’m unable to do anything other than draw a conclusion that you are attracted to juvenile female children.</p>
      <p>‘And that you do pose a high risk of harm to children when you communicate with any genuine children in future.</p>
      <p>‘In those circumstances there really is no reasonable alternative to custody.’</p>

      <p>She took into account his background and his post-traumatic stress disorder suffered from distressing experiences in the Army.</p>
      <p>He was jailed for three years, while his 10-year sexual harm prevention order (SHPO) and his signature on the sex offenders’ register were extended to become indefinite.</p>
