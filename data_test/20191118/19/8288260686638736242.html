      <h1>Pundit makes claim about Aston Villa star - and Liverpool fans won't like it</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news includes Gareth Southgate told Tyrone Mings is the 'solution' for England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:15:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Tyrone Mings is the answer to England’s lingering centre-back question, according to former goalkeeper Paul Robinson.</p>
      <p>Harry Maguire appears to be Gareth Southgate’s first-choice in the middle of the defence but the boss has experimented with different partners for the Manchester United player.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/tyrone-mings">Mings</a> returned to the England side to face Kosovo on Sunday having sat out the 7-0 win against Montenegro earlier in the week, in which Manchester City’s John Stones was preferred next to Maguire.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> star <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/uncomfortable-mixed-response-aston-villa-17271839">helped the Three Lions on their way to another clean sheet</a> in a routine 4-0 victory in the final Euro 2020 qualifying match.</p>

      <p>Joe Gomez of Liverpool is the other leading contender to take the second centre-back spot but Robinson reckons Mings is the solution.</p>
      <p>“I was surprised that he was left out of the last game, really surprised that Gareth Southgate put John Stones into the side, one because of his lack of game time and two because I think the way Mings played in the game before that, he deserved to keep his place,” the ex-England and Tottenham stopper told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-robinson-raves-about-aston-villa-star-who-has-massive-advantage-over-intl-rivals/">Football Insider.</a></p>
      <p>“He’s had a problem at centre-half, and I worry if the solution will be found before we face better teams, but I think Tyrone Mings is the answer to his problem.</p>
      <p>“He’s made it clear that Maguire is his No.1 centre-half and Mings should be his partner.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I was surprised that he was left out the last game, he’s very very good with the ball at his feet, he’s comfortable, he’s a left-footed centre-half so that gives him a massive advantage over others.</p>
      <p>“I’ve played with two right-footed centre-halves and neither want to play on the left, so he brings that balance, he is good in the air, he’s strong, he reads the game well and I think him and Maguire should be the centre-half partnership.”</p>
