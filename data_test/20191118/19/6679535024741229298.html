      <h1>Mumbai’s air quality likely to improve in 3-4 days: Skymet</h1>
      <h2>‘North-easterly winds will arrive in city, bring winter along’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T19:53:06+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Dhairya-Gajara-91151/" target="_blank">Dhairya Gajara</a></address>
      <p>While Delhi struggled with its air quality post Deepavali, Mumbai heaved as a sigh of relief as it recorded the cleanest Deepavali in five years. This, coupled with the November rains, helped bring the city into the ‘good’ air quality index (AQI) category earlier this month.</p>
      <p>However, the joy was short-lived as air quality deteriorated in the following days and now stands in the ‘moderate’ category. Mumbaikars have been experiencing poor visibility in the mornings due to this, but experts say the city’s AQI will improve soon.</p>
      <h3>BKC fares worst</h3>
      <p>According to SAFAR, Mumbai’s overall AQI was 122 on Monday evening, with Bandra Kurla Complex being the worst at 208, while Andheri fared best at 121. The AQI is determined based on ambient concentration values of air pollutants.</p>
      <p>However, as per private weather forecaster Skymet’s app, the worst air quality recorded in the city at 8.30 p.m. on Monday was at Bhim Nagar in Ghatkopar, with an AQI of 307, which is classified as ‘hazardous’. The lowest AQI was recorded at Somaiya Hospital, Sion (88), marking it as unhealthy for sensitive groups. Other than that, Worli recorded 178, Chembur recorded 307 and Powai saw 108.</p>
      <p>The real-time app has a different index than that of SAFAR. Skymet marks an AQI of 0-30 as good, 31-60 as moderate, 61-90 as unhealthy for sensitive groups, 91-120 as unhealthy, 121-250 as very unhealthy and from 251 onwards as hazardous.</p>
      <p>A Skymet official said the city’s air quality will not deteriorate further and is likely to remain constant on the moderate level.</p>
      <p>Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet, said, “The north-easterly winds will hit Mumbai in three to four days and will help blow pollutants away, resulting in better air quality.”</p>
      <p>Speaking of the low visibility rate between 7.30 a.m. and 10 a.m., which is only 2.2 km, he said, “The visibility rate is worse in the morning as there is more moisture in the air, allowing pollutants to mix with mist and haze, thus forming a layer of smog.”</p>
      <h3>‘Longer-lasting winds’</h3>
      <p>Mr. Palawat also said the city would experience a fall in temperature in around four days, marking the onset of winter. “The fall in temperature will be accompanied by the north-easterly winds, which will blow for a longer time from November 23. The absence of these winds has caused the rise in pollutants right now.”</p>
      <p>Talking about the air quality of Delhi, Mr. Palawat said heavy winds blowing on Sunday and Monday in the national capital has improved the air quality but it will worsen again in a few days. “Due to the western disturbance, wind speed will be slow and moisture in the atmosphere will be high, which will result in worsening of the air quality. However, there are chances of rain in Delhi on 26th and 27th, which might help improve the air quality.”</p>
