      <p>T-Mobile announced Monday that its CEO, John Legere, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-steps-down-2019-11">will be stepping down</a> from his role in May 2020 after over seven years of heading up the mobile service provider.</p>
      <p>Legere, 61, is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/day-in-the-life-of-t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-2017-3">credited with T-Mobile’s growth</a> from struggling company to the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/283507/subscribers-to-top-wireless-carriers-in-the-us/">third-largest carrier in the US</a>. Since taking over T-Mobile in 2012, Legere has made efforts to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/john-legere-2014-6">overhaul the company’s culture and brand</a>.</p>
      <p>Legere is just as well-known for his unconventional demeanor as a tech exec, choosing to frequently wear T-Mobile magenta clothing, littering presentations with curse words, and even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BI8ImC7jQvf/?utm_source=ig_embed">riding a Segway</a> around the office. For his role, T-Mobile <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-chiefs-pay-valued-at-66-5-million-11556321156">paid Legere $66.5 million in 2018</a>, making him one of the highest-paid CEOs in the US.</p>
      <p>Prior to Legere’s departure from T-Mobile, rumors swirled that he was being considered for the role of CEO of the embattled startup WeWork, which has had a disastrous year and recently lost its chief executive. But Legere denied that rumor, and said he was “never having discussions” with the office-sharing company.</p>
