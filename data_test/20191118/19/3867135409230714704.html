      <p>The <a href="https://everettwa.gov/148/Animal-Services">Everett Animal Shelter</a> hosts thousands of stray and unwanted animals every year. Some are adopted right away, but some sit in the shelter for weeks at a time, waiting for a home. The shelter has dogs and cats, as well as some rabbits and birds, all looking for a loving home.</p>
      <p>All pets are vaccinated, spayed or neutered, and given a identifying microchip before they are adopted. Take a look at <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/tag/fur-and-feathers/">some of the dogs, cats and other animals</a> that are available for adoption at the shelter now.</p>
      <p>If youâ€™re interested in adopting an animal, the shelter is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, call 425-257-6000.</p>

      <p>Ariel is a quiet, 5 year old, who is looking for a quiet home to call her own. She has lived with other cats but will still need a proper introduction to any resident cats. (Arleigh Movitz/Everett Animal Shelter)</p>
