      <h3>‘Sports Illustrated’ Bombshell Haley Kalil Rocks Cheeky Black Bikini In Sizzling Double Instagram Update</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/haley-kalil/">Haley Kalil</a> brought some heat to her <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> page this week with a sizzling new upload that was an instant hit with her thousands of fans.</p>
      <p>The post was shared to the <i>Sports Illustrated: Swimsuit Edition</i> model’s feed on Monday, November 18, and gave fans a double dose of her incredible bikini body, as it included a duo of snaps from a recent vacation. The 27-year-old noted in the caption of her post that the first photo was “staged” for the social media platform while the second snap was an “actual” snap from the trip, though both versions seemed to go over extremely well with her 277,000 followers.</p>
      <p>Haley’s “staged” snap saw the red headed beauty standing in the sane and leaning up against a tree. She wore a minuscule black bikini that boasted a triangle-style top and minuscule cups that just enough to contain her voluptuous assets. Plenty of sideboob was left well within eyesight as the model posed for the shot, as was an ample amount of cleavage thanks to the swim top’s deep, plunging neckline.</p>
      <p>The bottom half of Haley’s look was equally-as-risque, if not more. The babe sported a seriously skimpy pair of bikini bottoms that covered only what was necessary, exposing her toned thighs and killer curves in their entirety. A teasing glimpse of the model’s peachy derriere was also provided, though it was only took a quick swipe to the left to bring fans to a better look at the area.</p>
      <p>Part two of Haley’s latest social media upload saw the model leaping in the air and into the sand with her long, sculpted legs slightly spread apart. The camera was positioned behind her, revealing the daringly cheeky style of the model’s itty-bitty bikini bottoms that left her booty almost completely bare – a view that was sure to have gotten more than a few pulses racing.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t long before fans of the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> model began showering the newest addition to her Instagram page with love. The double Insta update has already racked up more than 4,000 likes after just one hours of going live to the social media platform — and that number continues to grow by the minute. Mega fans of the babe took their admiration for the steamy shots even further by leaving compliments in the comment section for her jaw-dropping display.</p>
      <p>“You look amazing,” one person wrote, while another said that Haley was “goals.”</p>
      <p>“They are both great photos,” commented a third.</p>
      <p>Loading...</p>
      <p>“I showed your body to my [personal trainer] and said ‘this is what I want to look like,'” another fan shared.</p>

      <p>Haley has filled her Instagram feed with a myriad of bikini snaps, with many being from her rookie photo shoot for the 2019 edition of <i>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit</i> Magazine. One recent upload that included a photo from the publication saw the stunner rocking a <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5743411/haley-kalil-kenya-bikini-instagram/">brown patterned bikini</a> that left very little to the imagination. This look also proved popular with her fans, earning over 10,000 likes since going live to her page.</p>
