      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- A low-cost gift from a Maryland man to his wife turned out to be the perfect present when the scratch-off lottery ticket won a $50,000 jackpot.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old Montgomery County man<a href="https://www.mdlottery.com/potomac-man-finds-50000-winning-monopoly-scratch-off-for-wife/"> told Maryland Lottery officials</a> his wife is currently unable to leave the house, so he ventured forth to buy her some scratch-off tickets from Talbert's Ice and Beverage Service in Bethesda.</p>
      <p>The man said his wife made quick work of the tickets.</p>
      <p>"I call her a cheater," the man joked. "I say that because most of the time, she scratches the barcode and scans the ticket on the app to see if it's a winner."</p>
      <p>He said she used her usual method for the tickets he brought home and one, a $20 Monopoly scratch-off, came up as a $50,000 winner.</p>
      <p>"It was really surprising," said the husband, who claimed the winnings on his wife's behalf at lottery headquarters in Baltimore.</p>
      <p>The man said some of the money will go toward paying off bills and the rest is going into savings.</p>
