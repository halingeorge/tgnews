      <h1>New movie Invasion Planet Earth shot in Birmingham shows city blown up by aliens</h1>
      <h2>The ICC, Council House, Town Hall and Colmore Row becomes a killing field in the new film by Simon Cox</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:35:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Lockley</a></address>
      <p>Crowds flee in terror through the heart of Birmingham as alien spaceships hover overhead.</p>
      <p>And things take a turn for the worse as Independence Day hits the ICC, where crowds run screaming from the invaders.</p>
      <p>Colmore Row becomes a killing field, the Balti Triangle a bloodbath.</p>
      <p>The Town Hall and Council House are the scene of a terrible pitched battle.</p>
      <p>These astonishing scenes, involving no fewer than 900 extras, are part of a sci-fi epic filmed in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Set to hit the big screen on December 5, Birmingham is pretty much blitzed in Invasion Planet Earth, a movie 17 years in the making and starring city punk pop star Toyah Wilcox.</p>

      <p>The film was featured at popular city gathering MCM Comic Con and will be screened in cinemas next month.</p>
      <p>The film is, say its makers, “the ultimate war for Planet Earth”. After being plagued by Armageddon images, Brummies and buildings are picked off by a prowling alien craft.</p>
      <p>For Nuneaton director and co-writer Simon Cox, the cinema release is the culmination of a very long struggle.</p>

      <p>He spent years pitching the concept to movie moguls before ditching the traditional methods of turning his script in to a reality. Seven years ago, he took the bold step of crowdfunding the film through social media.</p>
      <p>Originally titled Kaleidoscope Man, the delays didn’t end there. Once the action scenes were shot in Birmingham, the stunning special effects took another two-and-a-half years to complete.</p>
      <p>In all, the epic was in the development stage for a decade, and took another seven years to produce.</p>
      <p>Birmingham is not the only local link. Based at Nuneaton’s Centenary Business Centre, Simon transformed his studio into an international space station.</p>

      <p>The outer space invaders also give Kenilworth a kicking in the movie.</p>
      <p>With 25 years experience under his belt, Simon has been involved in a number of award-winning documentaries and has directed supernatural thriller Written in Blood.</p>
      <p>“I’ve wanted to make an epic sci-fi movie since I first saw the original Star Wars when I was 13,” he says. “I came up with the initial idea for Kaleidoscope Man back in 1999 after I’d finished my first feature Written in Blood in 1998. I had no idea it would take me nearly 20 years to make.</p>
      <p>“Having worked in TV and film over the years, a lot of the people I’ve brought in were people I’d met along the way. I also found a few local people who have since joined the team. Our cameraman, Gordon Hickie, shot my first feature film and he now shoots Holby City, Casualty and The Inspector Lyndley Mysteries.</p>

      <p>“I found the cast via acting agencies apart from Toyah, who I met at a film meeting a few years ago.”</p>
      <p>He adds: “The main challenges have been financing the film. There isn’t really any real financial support for making independent movies in the UK at the moment, despite what you might hear about UK film industry, and especially now as the US film industry is spending multi-millions making their films here in the UK.”</p>
      <p>* Invasion Planet Earth opens in UK Cinemas from December 5. It is available on digital download from December 16 and DVD from December 30.</p>
      <h3>What the film is about</h3>
      <p>Here’s what the official movie blurb says:</p>
      <p>“After the death of his young daughter, Tom Dunn is a broken man. When his wife falls pregnant again, he cannot believe their luck. However, his joy is short lived, as on the very same day, the people of Earth become plagued with terrifying visions of the end of the world.</p>

      <p>“When a gigantic, all-consuming alien mothership appears in the sky and launches a ruthless attack on Earth’s cities, chaos and destruction follow.</p>
      <p>“Tom must find the strength and wisdom to save his wife and unborn child. However, first he must confront a shocking truth. A truth which threatens the key to the survival of the human race. The ultimate war for Planet Earth is about to begin...”</p>
      <h3>Birmingham - the film set</h3>
      <p>Birmingham has been a popular, if unlikely, recent setting for the film industry.</p>
      <p>* Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, released in 2016, featured scenes shot in Digbeth’s Jewellery Quarter and Spaghetti Junction. The Hollywood great turned the areas into a dystopian future world.</p>
      <p>* In 2015, car chase scenes were filmed for Kingsman: The Golden Circle, with much of Cornwall Street blocked off for more than a week.</p>
      <p>* That same year, zombie film The Girl With All The Gifts was shot in the city centre with office workers and shoppers getting a glimpse of Bond girl Gemma Arterton and Hollywood superstar Glenn Close.</p>
