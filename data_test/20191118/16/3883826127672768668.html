        <b>Den Bosch have apologised to Excelsior Rotterdam's Ahmad Mendes Moreira for declaring the striker mistook "crow sounds" for racist abuse during Sunday's Dutch second division match.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The referee brought the players off after half an hour as a result of the abuse from a section of the home fans.</p>
      <p>"Den Bosch were completely wrong yesterday with its initial reaction," the club said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"It appears there was racist abuse from the stands."</p>
      <p>On Sunday the club stated that opposition players near the De Viert stand inside their De Vliert stadium were regularly treated to a "crow concert" by the home support.</p>
      <p>But on Monday, they said: "That reaction was a blunder for which the club apologises to everyone, in particular to Excelsior player Ahmad Mendes Moreira.</p>
      <p>"The club is further investigating what actually happened and will make every effort to find and punish those who are guilty of this."</p>
      <p>Dutch football authorities have also opened an investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>Winger Moreira, 24, who was born in the Netherlands, said he was called a "negro and cotton-picker".</p>
      <p>"I'm just very angry and very sad that these things still happen," he added.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors will study camera footage and work with police to establish what happened during the match in the North Brabant region.</p>
      <p>The game, which ended 3-3 with Moreira scoring in the 44th minute, restarted after a 10-minute delay.</p>
      <p>It is the latest incident of racism in European football in recent months, which includes the abuse of England players <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50212951">in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria</a>, while Brescia striker Mario Balotelli threatened to walk off <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50295523">after being targeted by monkey chants</a> during his side's away loss to Hellas Verona in Serie A.</p>
