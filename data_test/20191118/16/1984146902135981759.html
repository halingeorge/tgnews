      <p>By day, he is a professor of astronomy at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/durham-university">Durham University.</a></p>
      <p>By night, he walks the streets providing vital warm clothing to those who sleep under the stars in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle city centre.</a></p>
      <p>As temperatures plummet during the winter months, there are still many living without a roof over their head in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>They’re not in this position out of choice, and many have nowhere else to turn.</p>
      <p>Homeless people are dying on the streets of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> at almost three times the national rate.</p>
      <p>An estimated 46 <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/homelessness">homeless</a> people in the area died between 2013 and 2017, according to data released by the Office for National Statistics.</p>

      <p>Richard Stephenson knew he had to do something to help those living in sub-zero conditions who face a fight for survival night after night, sleeping in shop doorways and graveyards to escape the chilling winter wind and rain.</p>
      <p>The 78-year-old takes the bus from his <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fenham">Fenham</a> home into Newcastle up to three nights a week to selflessly provide support for the homeless.</p>
      <p>Armed with thermal hats, gloves, socks and chocolates, Richard speaks to those less fortunate in the area around Northumberland Street, Blackett Street and Grainger Street.</p>
      <p>Richard said: "I saw North East Homeless helping people on the streets about six months ago and I became very attached to it.</p>
      <p>"But I thought I could do something on my own. So I go to B&amp;M and Poundstretcher to stock up on socks and gloves as well as chocolate bars. Penguins and Wagon Wheels are very popular.</p>
      <p>"I want the people to know that they matter and people do care about them."</p>
      <p>On his latest journey he came across 15 people on the streets - an alarming number of people with nowhere to go in just a short distance.</p>
      <p>The semi-retired professor, who is also president of the Newcastle Astronomical Society, is shocked by the number of people sleeping on our streets and has vowed to do what he can to help those desperate for warmth and shelter.</p>

      <p>He said: "It worries me a lot. I like to give something back.</p>
      <p>"I have got to know some of them over the past six months and there are people who are really genuine.</p>
      <p>"The reaction I usually get is very positive.</p>
      <p>"I feel more needs to be done to stop people living on the streets. It's appalling that people are in this position."</p>
      <p>Richard's actions were recently brought into the spotlight on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook </a>with a post praising his generosity being shared more than 6,000 times.</p>
      <p>His granddaughter, India Stacey, set up a JustGiving page on the back of the viral post, with more than £300 being raised to go towards items for Richard to give out to those living on the streets.</p>
      <p>He added: "I don't have a mobile phone, never mind social media. I never thought about fundraising because I wouldn't ask.</p>
      <p>"I am so grateful people have donated. Hundreds of people die on the streets of this country every year and it's tragic.</p>
      <p>"Homelessness is a real problem in Newcastle. I know what I do is just small but I like to think it gives those poor homeless people someone to talk to and lifts their spirits during these freezing cold nights."</p>
