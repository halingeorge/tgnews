        <b>LEE McGREGOR was serenaded in an Edinburgh boozer as he celebrated his win over Kash Farooq.</b>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/4962278/lee-mcgregor-kash-farooq-british-bantaweight/">Scot won an explosive fight by split decision</a> in front of a packed Emirates Arena on Saturday night.</p>

      <p>In just his eighth bout as a pro McGregor triumphed to add the British bantamweight belt to his Commonwealth title.</p>
      <p>And he partied in style with his Gorgie Hearts AFC team-mates.</p>
      <p>The amateur football side uploaded a video of the new champ in the pub with his belt with chants of "Saturday night and I like the way you move Lee McGregor" sang throughout.</p>

      <p>One judge scored the contest in favour of McGregor at 114-113 with one opting for Farooq at the same score.</p>
      <p>But the 115-112 margin of the third judge was a hugely controversial one, especially after McGregor had a point docked for repeated holding in the tenth.</p>
      <p>Speaking after his win, he said: “It was never in doubt. I had a good start. In the later rounds I felt he was sneaking things with his tippy tappy stuff on the inside.</p>
      <p>“I felt when I was sticking to my boxing I was winning the rounds quite clearly. Kash is very clever and I had to just stand and grind it out with him now and again.</p>
      <p>“But I had a strong finish, and that won me the fight. It was a gruelling, hard battle.</p>
      <p>“I was confident I’d won, but when I got the point off I knew it would be tighter. Without that I’d have been very confident.</p>
      <p>“I felt he should have had a point off too. I did some holding in the middle rounds, but in the last rounds it was him.</p>
      <p>"It doesn’t matter — I’ve got that British title. I’m just so happy.”</p>
