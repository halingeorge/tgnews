      <p>Kellogg’s head of digital is urging FMCG brands to not “just check the digital box” and instead think holistically about how digital is integrated across the business.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the IGD conference last week, the brand’s chief global digital consumer and customer experience officer, Julie Bowerman explained: “CPG can make mistakes [when] just checking the digital box.”</p>
      <p>Bowerman, who heads up the company’s digital strategy, added: “Often ecommerce is put in sales or marketing when it’s both. You need to build a vision [which includes] both. [To do this], you hire the right people and create the right investments. We think about it holistically.”</p>
      <p>This holistic model includes a hybrid strategy that capitalises on Kellogg’s heritage while adopting leaner strategies favoured by digital disruptors.</p>
      <p>She explained: “You have to [capitalise] on your heritage, your legacy and your scale but to compete you have to think like digitally native brands.”</p>
      <p>Bowerman also noted that she staffed her team with a “blended” mix of talent that includes more traditional FMCG marketers and more tech-focused hires, noting “both matter and bring unique capabilities.”</p>
      <p>She is also expanding her team’s reach across the business: “We are training our account teams with the language and skills of ecommerce.”</p>
      <p>Bowerman admits that although Kellogg’s “is not perfect”, when it comes to being a digital company the brand is “wiring cross-functional partnerships” so this way of working is ingrained in the business.</p>
      <p>“We are constantly integrating with finance and supply chain and bringing them in early on. We are constantly stewarding so it becomes ingrained as part of a team, telling [others] why we’re doing [something] and what the value is,” she added.</p>
      <p>Speaking about how the brand has had to change with the advent of digital disrupters, she said: “Our competitors are much more vast, so the range and scale of innovation needs to be more broad and vast as that’s what shoppers expect.”</p>
      <p>She added that consumers habits are also changing as “search is replacing TV as a means of discovery”.</p>
      <p>Alongside her desire for a mixed team, Bowerman said that building an overarching culture is vital.</p>
      <p>She explained: “The most important [thing] is the culture and team dynamics. I like to use the word scrappy but scrappy means you break down barriers, you don’t need to wait to do things and you figure things out.”</p>
