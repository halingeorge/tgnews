      <p>Approximately 60 examples of the breed are produced daily at the time of writing, and BMW believes that the four-door M8 will outsell the coupe and convertible in the near future. Those who have ordered this bad boy here in standard or Competition specification can expect delivery in January ‚Äò20 at the earliest.</p>
      <p>A limited edition of 400 units will be available from April, called <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/new-bmw-m8-gran-coupe-revealed-for-2020-first-edition-limited-to-400-units-138144.html">First Edition</a> because imagination works in mysterious ways. As opposed to other M8 Gran Coupe models, the 1st boasts Aurora Diamond Green metallic paintwork from the BMW Individual color palette, Iconis Laser Lights with yellow garnish, gold-bronze trim, and Y-spoke alloy wheels similar to Concept M8 Gran Coupe.</p>
      <p>Both variants of the M8 GC are propelled by a 4.4-liter V8 with twin-turbocharging technology, developing 600 PS (591 horsepower) and 625 PS (617 horsepower). Torque is unchanged across the lineup, peaking at 750 Nm (553 pound-feet) between 1,800 and 5,600 rpm. As the badge on the rear implies, M xDrive comes standard with a 2WD driving mode for extremely smokin‚Äô burnout action.</p>
      <p>There‚Äôs no manual option available whatsoever. Alas, customers will have to settle for the tried-and-tested 8HP torque-converter automatic from ZF called M Steptronic in this application. Zero to 62 miles per hour (100 km/h) is rated at 3.2 seconds for the Competition and 3.3 seconds for the bone-stock variant.</p>
      <p>BMW has kicked off M8 Competition coupe and convertible production back in July 2019, and both models are available to configure in most markets around the world. Over in the United States, pricing starts at $130,000 for <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/bmw-8-series-gran-coupe-2019.html#aeng_bmw-8-series-gran-coupe-2019-840i-8at-340-hp">the Gran Coupe</a>, $133,000 for the coupe, and $142,500 for the soft-top convertible model. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>7 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>At the BMW Group's Dingolfing plant, the new BMW M8 Gran Coup√© rolled off the production line for the first time at the beginning of November. As the sixth model variant, the BMW M8 Gran Coup√© completes the BMW 8 Series family and at the same time continues the BMW Group's model offensive in the luxury segment. As a competition model, the four-door high-performance sports car is powered by the most powerful engine ever developed for BMW M automobiles. The 4.4-litre eight-cylinder engine produces 625 hp and offers outstanding dynamic performance.</p>
        <p>The BMW M8 Gran Coup√© is characterised by its independent proportions, dynamically stretched silhouette and gently flowing roof line at the rear. Compared to the two-door model variants, the wheelbase has been extended by 200 millimetres, resulting in a significantly improved level of comfort in two full-fledged rear seats. The BMW Group's Dingolfing plant produces up to 60 units of the BMW M8 model family per day. A good 40 percent of the production volume is accounted for by the Gran Coup√©.</p>
        <p>"With the new BMW M8 Gran Coup√©, the location has once again proven what it is capable of. After five successful ramp-ups in 2019, we have once again strengthened our position at the top of our model portfolio and strengthened our position as the leading unit of the luxury class. All employees can be proud of this," says Christoph Schr√∂der, Head of the BMW Group Dingolfing Plant.</p>
        <p>The new BMW M8 Gran Coup√© will celebrate its world premiere in just a few days at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The regular market launch of the BMW M8 Gran Coup√© and the BMW M8 Competition Gran Coup√© will take place in January 2020. A special series limited to 400 units will also be available from April next year. A highlight of the BMW M8 Gran Coup√© First Edition is the BMW Individual special paint finish Aurora Diamond Green metallic and the BMW Iconic Laser Light in penetrating yellow.</p>
        <p>The BMW Group Dingolfing plant</p>
        <p>The Dingolfing plant is one of the BMW Group's 31 production sites worldwide. Every day, around 1,500 BMW 3 Series, 4 Series, 5 Series, 6 Series, 7 Series and 8 Series cars roll off the production line at the 2.4 plant. In 2018, the plant produced a total of almost 330,000 vehicles. Currently, around 18,000 employees and 800 trainees are employed at the Dingolfing plant.</p>
        <p>In addition to the automotive core production, the production of vehicle components such as pressed parts or chassis and drive components is located at the site. Thanks to its aluminium expertise in chassis construction and many years of experience in alternative drive systems, the BMW Group Dingolfing plant supplies key components such as high-voltage accumulators, electric transmissions and drive structures for the new BMW i models to Leipzig and manufactures high-voltage accumulators and electric motors for plug-in hybrid models of the BMW Group.</p>
        <p>The plant also builds the bodyshells for all Rolls-Royce models. The so-called Dynamic Centre, a large storage and transshipment centre, supplies the worldwide BMW and MINI dealer organisation with original BMW parts and accessories.</p>
