      <h1>Medco E&amp;P to begin production at Temelat gas block in South Sumatra next month</h1>

      <p>The government expects the Temelat gas field in South Sumatra to begin production in early December, one month behind schedule.</p>
      <p>The Upstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Task Force (SKK Migas) said in a statement on Monday that the project, which began development in 2017, was delayed by problems related to land acquisition and opposition from local residents.</p>
      <p>SKK Migas projects head Luky Yusgiantoro said the regulatory body had talked with the field’s developer, Jakarta-based oil and gas company Medco E&amp;P, and "forecast the project will be onstream by December 10, 2019.”</p>
      <p>He added that the project’s estimated value was US$11.4 million and gas production was expected to hit 10–12 million cubic feet per day (mmscfd).</p>
      <p>Both figures are largely unchanged from the initial estimated value of $11 million and expected production rate of at least 10 million mmscfd.</p>
      <p>The block is set to serve industrial gas customers including state-owned gas distributor PGN and fertilizer maker Pupuk Sriwidjaja Palembang (Pusri).</p>
