      <p>The January transfer window is fast approaching for Nottingham Forest and their Championship rivals - and we have taken a look at the latest gossip around English football's second tier.</p>
      <p>At the City Ground, Matty Cash continues to be linked with a move to the Premier League - and Reds legend <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-cash-3549393">Kenny Burns has had his say</a> on the speculation.</p>
      <p>Everton and Crystal Palace are among the top-flight sides to reportedly have an interest in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest's</a> utility man, with Burns suggesting it is a positive that reflects on his former side's current form.</p>
      <p>"In all honesty, seeing your players linked with other clubs can be seen as a good thing because generally, it means they’re playing well and so is the team," said Burns.</p>

      <p>"Cash has been a revelation at right-back since being played there by Sabri Lamouchi, following injuries to Tendayi Darikwa and then Carl Jenkinson.</p>
      <p>"I’ve said before that I’d much rather see a round peg in a round hole and that would always be the case, although in fairness to Cash, he’s let nobody down and has stuck manfully to his task.</p>
      <p>"He's great for a manager to have around the squad.</p>
      <p>"Cash is willing to learn, he’s eager, works tirelessly, never stops running and, I’d imagine, he would do anything his manager asks of him, and that can sometimes be a rare commodity.</p>
      <p>"While it might just be speculation, when you’re talking about the money that’s been reported, it would be really tough to turn that down."</p>
      <h3>Manchester United target Reading striker</h3>

      <p>Manchester United are among several Premier League clubs considering a move for Reading’s 20-year-old striker Danny Loader, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/11864054/manchester-united-considering-danny-loader-bid-with-several-premier-league-clubs-also-interested">Sky Sports News report.</a></p>
      <p>The forward, who saw a deadline day move to join Wolverhampton Wanderers fall through last summer, is out of contract at the end of the season and the report adds that talks on a renewal with the Royals have stalled.</p>
      <p>As such, a move in January is heavily tipped to go ahead in order for Reading to receive a higher fee for his services.</p>
      <h3>Chelsea join Liverpool and United in chase for Wigan talent</h3>
      <p>Chelsea have joined Liverpool and Manchester United in the hunt for Wigan Athletic starlet Joe Gelhardt, <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-join-man-utd-liverpool-20897626">reports from the Daily Star state.</a></p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has appeared seven times off the bench for the Championship strugglers and his emergence has caught the eye of a number of top-flight clubs ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The report adds that Manchester City, Tottenham and Everton have also been monitoring Gelhardt’s meteoric rise.</p>
      <h3>Michael O’Neill identifies Stoke City striker target</h3>

      <p>Michael O’Neill is looking to bolster Stoke City’s attack with the signing of Aberdeen striker Sam Cosgrove, according to Sunday’s print edition of the Sun.</p>
      <p>The former Everton youngster has struck 16 goals already this season and fired 21 goals for Aberdeen last season, establishing himself as one of the most prolific goalscorers in British football.</p>
      <p>O’Neill - who took charge of the Potters for the first time in their 4-2 win over Barnsley last time out - has now identified the 22-year-old as the ideal candidate to improve his attacking options.</p>
      <h3>Leeds United reignite David Stockdale interest</h3>
      <p>Leeds United have <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/keen-leeds-united-linked-january-17271164">revived their interest</a> in Birmingham City goalkeeper David Stockdale, according to the Sunday People.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old has made only one appearance for Birmingham this season, in August's 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat to Portsmouth.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s side drafted in Kiko Casilla last January but could be forced into the market due to the Spaniard’s potential ban after he was charged by the FA over alleged racist abuse in a game against Charlton Athletic earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>Casilla denies the allegation.</p>
      <p>The Sunday People report claims that 34-year-old Stockdale, a boyhood fan of the club, is being considered as a January target after previously being linked with the club back in 2018.</p>
