      <p>Accra, Nov. 18, GNA — Job Market International Limited, an intermediary and service providing company which aids job seekers attain employment has been launched in Accra.</p>
      <p>Job Market International provides a platform to link employers and employees, hence provide employment opportunities for skilled literates who can work in offices and other areas where their services would be needed.</p>
      <p>Founded this year in Ghana and located inside the Trade Fair Centre, Job Market works with affiliates in countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada to provide services to clients.</p>
      <p>In an address, Madam Georgina Adjei, the Country Manager for Job Market International, said one underlying cause for the high unemployment rate in the country was because most citizens were unaware of the appropriate institutions to send job applications.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, she said, most companies due to unethical behaviours displayed by some employees in times past, were hesitant to give attention to new applicants.</p>
      <p>“However, the arrival of Job Market International would breach the trust gap that existed between workers and employers,” she added.</p>
      <p>Madam Adjei said the company would spearhead the job search for clients and ensure that whatever conditions were needed to improve their lives were provided.</p>
      <p>“Most workers face the problem of not being well paid after rendering their services, so we will ensure that they receive the remunerations they deserve without delay. When we realize that any employer wants to take advantage of our clients, we would abrogate the contract. We are into people and helping them find jobs to make life easier,” she stated.</p>
      <p>She said the company would make sure that employers paid the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) deductions promptly so that on retirement, they would have enough to live on.</p>
      <p>The Country Manager noted that after a job had been secured for a client, they would agree with the client on the percentage to be deducted by Job Market for their services.</p>
      <p>She added that the percentage to be deducted would be dependent on the amount received by the worker monthly, thus, there was no fixed percentage to be deducted.</p>
      <p>The registration of clients started with a finger print scan with the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), followed by the opening of an account with the company’s preferred bank, a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) registration with the Ghana Revenue Authority, SSNIT registration and then finally, all details were submitted to the staff of Job Market for compilation and processing of one’s job application.</p>
      <p>Madam Adjei said Opportunities are also created for non-literates who did not have any skill at all to be trained and bring their knowledge to good use.</p>
      <p>Registered under the Laws of Ghana, the company provides solution to all plumbing, electrical, construction and housekeeping, home-care needs, among others.</p>
