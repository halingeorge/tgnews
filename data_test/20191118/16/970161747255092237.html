      <p>Most Americans now think <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> should be removed as president and booted out of the White House, according to a new poll.</p>
      <p>A survey undertaken by ABC News found 51% of people want Trump to be impeached and convicted, which would spell the end of his presidency.</p>
      <p>The same survey found that 70% of Americans thought Trump was wrong to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe his opponent Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Just over one in 10 (13%) agreed Trump’s behavior with Zelensky was wrong, but said it is not an impeachable offense.</p>
      <p>And exactly a quarter of people polled think Trump has done nothing wrong.</p>

      <p>Trump, who denies any wrongdoing, is accused of offering the Ukraine $400million in military aid, then suggesting it probe Joe Biden’s son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Hunter Biden has faced questions over his links to a Ukrainian natural gas company called Burisma, although denies any impropriety. His father is front-runner to be nominated as a presidential candidate by the Democrat party next year, meaning he would battle Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>Ukraine has faced repeated aggression from Russia, with the US cash intended to help bolster its defenses and deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from a potential invasion.</p>
      <p>Public impeachment hearings continue on Tuesday, and are expected to wrap up by the end of the week.</p>
      <p>Last week former US Ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told the hearing on Capitol Hill that she felt ‘threatened’ by Trump’s behavior to her.</p>
      <p>The highly successful diplomat was fired from her posting in Kiev in May 2019 after a smear campaign by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, reportedly at the president’s behest.</p>
      <p>She believes she was fired because of her focus on tackling corruption.</p>
      <p>The lower house of the US Congress – the House of Representatives or ‘House’ are likely to prepare articles of impeachment – equivalent to charges.</p>
      <p>If enough representatives vote to impeach Trump on these charges, he will face a trial in the upper house of Congress – the Senate.</p>
      <p>That will see represenatives from the House present their case just as prosecutors would at a criminal trial.</p>
      <p>The Senate then holds a vote on whether or not to convict the president, with a two thirds majority needed to remove him from office.</p>
      <p>It is currently comprised of a majority of Republican senators, with those politicians currently considered unlikely to vote their own president out of office.</p>
