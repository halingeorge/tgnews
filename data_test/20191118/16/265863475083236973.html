      <p>Kylie Jenner is making some business moves these days. The Shade Room revealed that she just sold the majority of her ownership of her cosmetic company to Coty Inc.</p>
      <p>It was revealed that she sold it for $600 million.</p>
      <p>TSR writes that Kylie definitely knows how to secure her bag and cites the info from Harpers Bazaar US:</p>
      <p>‘Kylie and Coty Inc. announced their partnership on Monday and revealed that the company would own 51 percent of Kylie’s beauty empire, which is currently worth $1.2 billion.’</p>
      <p>TSR also cited Kylie who reportedly said the following:</p>
      <p>‘I’m excited to partner with Coty to continue to reach even more fans of Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin around the world. I look forward to continuing the creativity and ingenuity for each collection that consumers have come to expect and engaging with my fans across social media,’ she said.</p>

      <p>See what more she had to say in the caption of TSR’s post.</p>
      <p>People are convinced that the beauty mogul is definitely working on something new and they cannot wait to find out what it is.</p>
      <p>Someone said: ‘Major moves‼️ btw this just means she’s about to drop something new.’</p>
      <p>Another follower posted this: ‘We are the same age and she got 1000x the amount of money I got.. that’s motivation right there😈.’</p>
      <p>One fan said: ‘She’ll just make another company. And prosper there. She’s the brightest of the bunch 👍🏽‼️💯’</p>
      <p>A person posted this: ‘of course she would. Her cosmetics line isn’t doing that well anymore and she’s got to find a way to cut her losses. This was a very smart move. I think she’s got something else up her sleeve that she’s working on and even if she doesn’t and focuses on motherhood, she can do that!</p>
      <p>People were not expecting this move from Kylie’s part.</p>
      <p>It’s been recently revealed that tomorrow, November 19th, Kylie Cosmetics will launch the Holiday 19 collection.</p>
