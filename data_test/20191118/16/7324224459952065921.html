      <p>A 25-year-old man died after the early-hours crash which involved a black Peugeot 207 and a HGV near Lichfield.</p>
      <p>The crash happened on the eastbound carriageway of the A5 between Muckley Corner and Wall at around 12.25am on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The man was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>A 41-year-old man from Walsall was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 37-year-old woman, also from Walsall, was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.</p>
      <p>Both have since been released under investigation pending further inquiries.</p>
      <p>Murray MacGregor, spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service, said: "We were called at 12.28am to reports of a male pedestrian in collision with a van.</p>
      <p>"A paramedic officer attended the scene, unfortunately it was immediately obvious nothing could be done to save the man and he was confirmed dead at the scene."</p>
      <p>Anyone who witnessed the collision, has dash-cam footage or may have seen anyone walking on the road between Wall and Muckley Corner is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 19 of November 16.</p>
