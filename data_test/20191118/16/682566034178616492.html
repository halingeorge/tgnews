      <p>Mexico City - <b>Brendon Todd</b> sealed back-to-back PGA Tour wins on Monday after holding his nerve to clinch a one-shot victory in the weather-interrupted <b>Mayakoba Golf Classic</b> in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Todd, winner of the Bermuda Championship a fortnight ago, had shared the lead with American Vaughn Taylor on 20 under with four holes to play when darkness interrupted the final round on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The leaders returned to El Camaleon Golf Club in Playa del Carmen early Monday to complete a tournament which had been disrupted by the loss of the entire first day on Thursday due to heavy rain.</p>
      <p>"It's incredible. I'm overcome with emotion right now," Todd, 34, said shortly after clinching only the third PGA Tour win of his career.</p>
      <p>"The whole final round was much more nerve-racking for me than Bermuda."</p>
      <p>Todd had resumed on the par-three 15th hole and grabbed the outright lead after sinking a 20-foot putt for birdie.</p>
      <p>Although he followed that with a bogey on 16, Taylor also bogeyed the same hole to leave Todd one shot clear.</p>
      <p>Todd eventually carded a closing three-under-par 68 to finish on 20 under, one clear of Mexico's Carlos Ortiz, Adam Long and Taylor.</p>
      <p>Harris England finished alone in fifth spot on 17 under after a closing 70.</p>
      <p>Todd pocketed $1.3 million for the win, after claiming a $540 000 winner's cheque at Bermuda earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The back-to-back titles were Todd's first since his only other win on the PGA Tour at the 2014 Byron Nelson Championship.</p>
