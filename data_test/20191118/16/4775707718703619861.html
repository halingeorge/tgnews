      <p>The Breaking Ground expansion adds to the exploration and experimentation themes of the game. Players will get a storage container in their craft. They can fill this with science equipment and then, once arrived at their destination, they can sift through it to decide which pieces of equipment to deploy. The equipment available includes: a central station, booster antenna, solar panel, weather station, active seismometer, RTG, goo observation, and ion detector. Breaking Ground also adds a lot of, well, ground; outcroppings of rock, cryovolcanoes, meteors and craters can now be found throughout the solar system. Smaller surface features are able to be transported, but larger ones need to have Kerbals sent out to them in rovers, or to be attended to by unmanned rovers. Breaking Ground also adds a new rover arm, which can be used to scan surface features to gather data.</p>

      <p>In Breaking Ground, players will go on research missions and set up a deployed science base to analyse their findings. Squad <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/game/breakingground/">say</a> that parts which have long been requested by players will now be added to the game. Hinges, pistons, rotors, and rotational servos of different sizes will be available, along with a robotics controller system, which aids players in coordinating all of the different pieces of equipment. Breaking Ground also includes a new suit. The expansion's aim is to add to what can be done once players have reached a celestial body, by adding more pieces of equipment and more surface features to study. Alongside the expansion will be a console update to fix more general issues, and which will address improvements. The update is free and will also address features requested by fans, such as the Improved Burn Time Indicator, the Delta-v Tool App, an Altitude toggle function to the Altimeter, Axis Group binding, and Part revamps.</p>
      <p>Breaking Ground is available on December 5th.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres — when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
