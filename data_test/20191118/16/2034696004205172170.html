      <p>The news comes <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/slipknot-announce-knotfest-sea-european-cruise-2568518">just days after Slipknot announced an expansion of their Knotfest events with a new ‘Knotfest as Sea’ cruise next summer. </a></p>
      <p>The cruise, which takes place from August 10-14, will depart from Barcelona, Spain and will feature two performances from Slipknot on the ship. The full line-up for the cruise is expected to be released soon.</p>
      <p>Since its foundations in 2012, Knotfest now takes place in five countries: the US, Japan, Mexico, Columbia and France.</p>
      <p>Teasing a clip of the new festival, Clown said: “Barcelona, a big-ass ship, and the sea. You, us, you’re not gonna want to miss it.”</p>
