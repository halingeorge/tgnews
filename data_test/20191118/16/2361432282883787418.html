      <h1>Ratings: Nathan Fillion's 'The Rookie' Ties a Series Low</h1>
      <h2>Bears-Rams on NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” falls hard from last week’s Panthers-Packers game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:33:56+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/tony-maglio/" target="_blank">Tony Maglio</a></address>
      <p>Time to turn in your badge and gun, Nathan Fillion? “The Rookie” tied its series-low rating last night, when ABC settled for fourth place among viewers 18-49.</p>
      <p>NBC was first in ratings with a 3.6 rating/16 share in the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic and in total viewers with an average of 12 million, according to preliminary numbers. Those Nielsen numbers were the average of the network’s 90-minute pregame show and then the “Sunday Night Football” game itself. The Chicago Bears vs. the Los Angeles Rams contest was <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/madam-secretary-new-low-ratings/">way down</a> from last week’s Carolina Panthers-Green Bay Packers game.</p>
      <p>CBS was second in ratings with a 2.1/9 and in viewers with 11.7 million. After an NFL overrun, “60 Minutes” starting at 8-ish had a 1.6/6 and 11 million viewers. At 9 or so, “God Friended Me” got a 0.8/3 and 6.9 million viewers. “NCIS: Los Angeles” at 10 received a 0.6/3 and 5.8 million viewers. “Madam Secretary” aired outside of primetime.</p>
