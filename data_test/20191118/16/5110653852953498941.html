      <p>Twins minor league infielder Ryan Costello was found dead in his New Zealand hotel room Monday, two days before he was scheduled to start his season in the Australian Baseball League, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Costello, 23, had been in New Zealand for less than a week. Preliminary findings indicate he died of natural causes, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisReive/status/1196302708778524672">statement</a> from Costello's ABL team, the Auckland Tuatara.</p>

      <p>A Wethersfield, Conn., native, Costello played three years at Central Connecticut State before being selected No. 31 overall by the Mariners in the 2017 draft. He was traded to the Twins organization in 2018, and split his time between High-A Fort Myers and Double-A Pensacola last season.</p>
      <p>"On behalf of the entire organization, the Twins send their most sincere condolences to Ryan's family, friends, coaches and teammates," the Twins said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/1196437555002200065/photo/1">statement</a>.</p>
