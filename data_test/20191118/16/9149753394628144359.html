      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/spintires/">Spintires</a>, the driving sim that reflects man's primal battle with nature by making you drive through loads of mud, is now going to Chernobyl in a new expansion. It's like Stalker, but you're only interested in finding logging sites and keeping your precious truck running.</p>
      <p>As a trucker, you'll have to drive around the exclusion zone to hunt down prize logging sites, while also trying to avoid getting blasted by radiation—you get a Geiger counter—or damaging your vehicle during your off-road shenanigans. The expansion includes two new vehicles, the B-157 and B-505, which will hopefully be hardy enough for the tough job. </p>
      <p>The power plant, Pripyat, Red Forest, Kupsta Lake and the Duga Radar have all been recreated, so you can go on a lovely, morbid sightseeing tour. With the HBO miniseries still pretty fresh in my mind, I'd honestly rather not. </p>
      <p>The expansion is for Oovee Games' original Spintires from 2014, rather than Mudrunner (formerly Spintires: Mudrunner), an updated version of the game from Saber Interactive and Focus.  It's the third piece of DLC to appear this year, but seems considerably larger than the previous two. </p>
      <p>You'll be able to fight radioactive mud in December.</p>
