      <p>Apple replaced iTunes with a trio of apps when they released macOS Catalina and shifted device management into Finder. For Windows users, the iTunes experience is more complicated. The software was designed as a music player first and later integrated with the iTunes Store. In the spirit of library curation, iTunes eventually introduced the idea of device syncing. Many people loved the expanded catch-all iTunes design, encapsulating media consumption, device managent, and library management. Others hated that iTunes became a bloated and slow experience.</p>
      <h4>Why Using an iTunes Alternative to Manage iOS Devices Matters</h4>
      <p>iTunes adopted library management, which was a blessing and a curse. It helped to consolidate media and keep everything in sync between your computer and iPhone. However, there are risks of losing data when <a href="https://www.5kplayer.com/iphone-manager/iphone-photo-transfer-backup.htm">transferring iPhone photos</a>. Using iTunes, you cannot flexibly drag-and-drop pictures to sync. If you delete photos from Mac or PC, this change also syncs to your iPhone. Content always goes from a computer to iPhone, not the other way around.</p>
      <p>If you are in the "ditch iTunes" camp, <a href="https://www.5kplayer.com/iphone-manager/">DearMob iPhone Manager</a> is a highly-focused iPhone management tool could be another option. You can <a href="https://www.5kplayer.com/iphone-manager/">download DearMob iPhone Manager for free</a> to use all the features, or <a href="https://www.5kplayer.com/iphone-manager/holiday-offer.htm?imore">buy a lifetime full version of DearMob now</a> with a 50% holiday discount.</p>
