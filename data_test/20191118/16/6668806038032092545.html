      <p>2019 has been a rather splendid year for Bollywood. While many films managed to make it big at the box-office, the audience also had a variety at offer. Be it hard-hitting entertainers like Kabir Singh or Article 15, which mirrored pride and prejudice in society, Bollywood explored other genres as well. Another addition to the list now will be Dharma Production’s Good Newwz. Starring Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, this film is a slice of life comedy revolving around one big goof up that causes havoc. With the trailer of the film launched by the cast today, we decided to list 3 reasons why the film should be a one to watch out for. Have a look… <br/><br/>Akshay Kumar and Comedy <br/><br/>Every actor is comfortable with a particular genre, which can be considered as his home turf. For Shah Rukh Khan it is romance, for Salman Khan it can be masala action entertainers but Akshay definitely is at the forefront in comedy. </p>

      <p>Yes, he’s done a fair share of action- packed films as well but comedies bring out the best in the actor. Akshay has an impeccable comic timing, which has been evident ever since his Hera Pheri days. Watching Akshay in a comedy is a delight for the audience.</p>

      <p>Kareena Kapoor Khan <br/><br/>The ultimate diva of Bollywood - Kareena Kapoor Khan is always a sight to behold. Her charisma alone is enough to pull in crowds. But with films like Chameli, Omkara and Jab We Met, she’s proved that she’s much more than a pretty face. Another interesting aspect is that recently, the actress has recently opted for unorthodox projects and roles. </p>

      <p>Her characters in films like Udta Punjab, Ki &amp; Ka and Veere Di Wedding definitely stand out from her work before. We are keen to watch what she now has to offer.</p>

      <p>Fresh pairing of Kiara and Diljit Dosanjh <br/><br/>While DIljit Dosanjh has found his feet in Bollywood, Kiara Advani is definitely proving to be someone to watch out for. The earth shattering success of her last film, Kabir Singh, has definitely boosted her star value. So watching the chemistry of these young stars on the big screen without a doubt would be pretty exciting. </p>

      <p>From the trailer we can make out that the two will be playing an over- the- top Punjabi couple. They promise great fun.</p>

      <p>Interesting Story Line <br/><br/>Like we mentioned earlier, the audience are now treated with different types of content as makers are trying to move away from the beaten track. This works best for audiences since they’re now offered more interesting characters, different storylines and concepts that they’re not used to watching on the big screen. Good Newwz is another addition to this list as writer Jyoti Kapoor brings us a fresh comedy based on a monumental goof up. </p>

      <p>Good Newwz revolves around two couples, who’re facing difficulties in conceiving. They opt for an In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) procedure in hope for a child but the sperms of the two men get mixed up by the hospital and end up fertilising the eggs of women, who aren’t their wives.</p>

      <p>Debut Director <br/><br/>It is always exciting when a director makes his Bollywood debut. The audience can enjoy a new vision and sensibility. With Good Newwz, Raj Mehta has put on the director’s hat for the first time. Raj Mehta is no new name in this space as he’s worked with reputed Dharma directors like Shashank Khaitan and Shakun Batra previously. </p>

      <p>Shashank Khaitan is his mentor and played a big hand in helping him reach this stage. In fact, such is his faith in his young prodigy that Shashank has come on board as a producer of the film. While the trailer does look like a lot of fun, it will be interesting to see how the film fares at the box-office.</p>
