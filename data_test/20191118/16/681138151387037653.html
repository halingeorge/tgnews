        <b>A four-day working week introduced at a Suffolk factory five years ago has "absolutely transformed" the lives of its employees - and boosted productivity, its boss said.</b>

      <p>The Labour Party has come under fire for a pledge to cut the full-time working week from 37.5 hours, taking it to 32 hours over a 10 year period.</p>
      <p>The average UK full-time working week is 42.5 hours against a European Union average of 41.2, according to statistics body Eurostat.</p>
      <p>The bold move was criticised by big business lobby group the CBI which claimed that without productivity gains it would push many businesses into loss.</p>
      <p>But Rachel Garrett, managing director of CMG Technologies, based in Rendlesham, near Woodbridge, said they had introduced a four-day week some time ago after deciding to implement a "better and smarter way of working".</p>

      <p><b>MORE - </b><a href="https://www.eadt.co.uk/business/county-broadband-at-colchester-to-increase-workforce-to-79-1-6372973"><b>Rural broadband provider sees staggering growth as demand for hyperfast soars<br/></b></a>The manufacturing firm - started by Rachel's dad, Chris Conway, in the late 1990s - employs 22 staff. It recently featured on an ITV4 Made in Britain documentary, which highlighted its unique metal injection moulding (MIM).</p>
      <p>The Â£24m turnover business makes intricate parts for items such as razors and scalpels using a unique process which enables metal to be moulded to create precise, complex parts with low wastage.</p>
      <p>Ms Garrett said the four-day working model had worked well for staff - and for the business.</p>
      <p>"It has absolutely transformed life for our employees - creating significantly lower job stress and helping them strike a better work-life balance," she said.</p>
      <p>"Beyond wellbeing, our team is stronger and functions better and this has impacted the bottom line and allowed us to retain our very valuable employees.</p>
      <p>"What we do is very specialised so it's vital we attract and retain talent and the four-day week appears to be the icing on the cake for employees who want to split their week in a more efficient way."</p>
      <p>They were "thrilled" to have featured in the ITV4 documentary for their work in making razor heads for Edwin Jagger Safety Razors, she said.</p>
      <p>"To be able to show the part that we play in producing a British-made product is fantastic."</p>
      <p>Among other things, the firm supplies 40,000 scalpels a month to the NHS.</p>
