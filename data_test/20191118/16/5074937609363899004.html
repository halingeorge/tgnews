      <p>He said this had become necessary because of the numerous activities leading to the yuletide.</p>
      <p>“We are approaching the yuletide and the roads would be busy. We need to take off those motorists who are not ready to be on the roads”, the Commander said.</p>
      <p>He said the agenda of the District Command was to make sure majority of the motorbikes in the District were registered and insured by March 2020.</p>
