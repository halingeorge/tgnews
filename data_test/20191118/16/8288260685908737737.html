      <h2>The offers are available during the park's winter season</h2>

      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2pyzx3y">Disneyland Paris</a> has launched a number of deals for its winter season.</p>
      <p>Holidaymakers can bag themselves 35% off hotels and tickets as well as free flights or ferry trip ahead of the all-new Frozen Celebration kicking off in 2020.</p>
      <p>A highlight among Disneyland's winter deals is a free flights offer for children under 12 years old.</p>
      <p>If you're arriving between January 6 and March 31 in 2020 then <a href="https://fave.co/2pyzx3y">one child will fly free</a> with every one paying adult, which includes flights from Birmingham Airport with Flybe.</p>
      <p>The other option is a <a href="https://fave.co/2pyzx3y">free ferry crossing</a> with P&amp;O Ferries if you'd rather make the trip by car. This offer applies to a standard car on a return trip from Dover to Calais.</p>
      <p>Plus you can also make savings of 35% on Disney hotels and tickets if you're arriving any time between now and April 1.</p>
      <p>So if you book your hotel and tickets at the same as the free flight or ferry deal is valid then you can make savings on the entire trip as the two can be used together as well as during school holidays.</p>
      <p>This discount is available on a minimum stay of two nights and three days and maximum stay of four nights and five days at the Disneyland Hotel, Newport Bay Club, Sequoia Lodge and Davy Crockett Ranch.</p>
      <p>January 11 sees the launch of Frozen Celebration at Disneyland Paris with the chance to meet Elsa, Anna and friends, festive floats, new souvenirs and treats and a brand new interactive animation experience in the Studio Park.</p>
      <p>Other departure airports available in the deal are Cardiff International, Edinburgh, Exeter, Manchester and Southampton.</p>
      <p>The free flights or ferry offer is available on bookings made until November 27.</p>
