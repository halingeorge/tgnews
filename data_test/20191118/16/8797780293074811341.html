      <p>Ever wanted to give your favourite pocket monster an upgrade but you didn’t have the time to wait for it to learn a new move the old-fashioned way? Well good news, because TMs are once again a core part of the experience that is Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield! There’s a split this year between these teaching devices, as Sword and Shield has both TMs and TRs.</p>
      <p>Long and short of it, is that TMs can be used as many times as you like whereas TRs are one-shot teaching tools. Quick note: I’m still working on being more precise with this guide, but I’ll update in the days to come with more images and exact locations. For now, here’s where you can find every TM in Pokemon Sword and Shield.</p>
