      <p>Bolgatanga, Nov. 18, GNA – The Association of Transparency and Accountable Governance (ATAG) has called on government to permit the newly commissioned 160-bed capacity Upper West Regional hospital in Wa, to commence operations.</p>
      <p>“The hospital if opened to the general public will carry the health delivery system of the region to another level with its modern facilities and equipment, ”ATAG said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The statement signed by Mr Seidu Jaadi, Lead Convener of ATAG and copied to the Ghana News Agency in Bolgatanga at the weekend, said the state-of-the-art facility which cost over $52 million remained closed to the public after it was commissioned by President Akufo-Addo in August, 2019.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, “The euphoria that heralded the commissioning of the facility by the people of the region has vanished into thin air as the people are left disappointed at the closure of the hospital despite its commissioning.”</p>
      <p>“The belief and thinking of the citizenry were that government was only buying time in its commissioning and working behind the scene with the project contractor to fix all the necessary equipment and also hire the needed manpower to ensure the full operations of the facility after its inauguration,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>It said there was an indication that all was set for the facility to be opened to the public, per statements made by government officials, and questioned “what then made it impossible for the facility to be opened to the public, since its commissioning”</p>
      <p>The statement said if the facility was operational, most needless deaths in the Region, especially the recent death that rocked the Region due to lack of essential medicines or negligence on the part of staff of a health facility, would have been prevented.</p>
