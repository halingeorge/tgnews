That’s down from the usual $199 price tag and typical $165 holiday advertised rate you’ll find at other retailers. This is also a match of our previous mention. The second-generation AirPods offer support for “Hey, Siri” and include Apple’s upgraded H1 chip for fast pairing. Great for a holiday gift this year or for yourself upgrading a mobile work setup. We loved them in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/28/airpods-2-review-unboxing-top-features/">our hands-on review</a>.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday pricing live for ecobee</h3>
      <p>Black Friday pricing on <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/18/ecobee-black-friday-pricing/">ecobee’s latest SmartThermostat with Voice Control is now live at Amazon for <b>$199</b></a>. Today’s deal is a $50 price break from the regular going rate and a return to the Amazon all-time low price. We’ve only seen it this low once before, back on Prime Day 2019. ecobee completely redesigned its new thermostat, now featuring a glass face and a “vivid” touch display. You’ll still be able to count on HomeKit and Siri control, along with support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and other smart home mediums. Ships with a new smart sensor that’s made to track temperatures throughout your home. Learn more in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/24/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-homekit/">our hands-on review</a>, where we called it “a very compelling option for many households.”</p>
      <h3>Apple’s latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro drops to $799</h3>
      <p>Electronic Express via Rakuten is offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/18/woot-12-ipad-pro/">Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch 64GB Wi-Fi for <b>$799</b></a>. That’s $200 off the regular rate, more than a $147 savings compared to <a href="https://amzn.to/32X4qwe">Amazon’s current sale price</a>, and happens to be a match for the lowest Amazon offer we can find. Apple’s latest iPad Pro features a Liquid Retina edge-to-edge display with ProMotion, True Tone, and wide color support. Face ID, a 12MP camera, and 10-hour battery life are also in tow, providing a truly great tablet experience.</p>
      <h3>Eve Door &amp; Window brings automations to your Siri setup</h3>
      <p>Amazon is currently offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/18/eve-door-window-homekit-entry-sensor/">Eve Door &amp; Window HomeKit Entry Sensor for <b>$30</b></a>. Usually selling for $40, today’s offer is good for a 25% discount, marks the first major price drop of the year, and is at a new Amazon all-time low. Eve’s entry sensor works with HomeKit via Bluetooth and is a great way to enhance the functionality of your Siri-enabled setup. Whether you’re looking to double down on automations, or bring home a greater sense of security, Door &amp; Window is a capable option. I personally use one to turn lights on and off in my apartment, but it can also be configured to notify you when opened, and more. </p>
