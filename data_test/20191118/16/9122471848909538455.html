      <h1>Bill Belichick Appears To Take A Shot At Eagles Player After Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:28:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>In a rematch of Super Bowl LII, the New England Patriots and their stellar defense proved the difference in a 17-10 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. But even though it’s been nearly two years since that Super Bowl loss, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick clearly remembered things that were said after it.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media after the game, Belichick took a dig at a comment Lane Johnson made after Philadelphia’s title win. He told the media that “everyone had fun out there today” – a clear shot at Johnson.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/2019/11/18/bill-belichick-seems-to-have-fun-with-lane-johnson-after-beating-eagles/">PatriotsWire</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“It looked like everyone had fun out there today and we played a lot of good energy and it was good to come down here and get a win,” Belichick said.</blockquote>
      <p>Johnson famously said after Philadelphia’s Super Bowl win that the Patriots were a “fear-based organization” and that the players “act like… robots.”</p>

      <p>As stern and aloof as Belichick acts at almost all times, even he isn’t above taking a shot at a mouthy opponent.</p>
      <p>His Patriots are currently putting up a historically good defense. They lead the league in fewest yards and points allowed.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia, meanwhile, is in a dog fight in the NFC East and looks like they’ll be outside of the playoffs if they don’t win the division.</p>
      <p>Belichick may have lost that Super Bowl, but with his eyes on back-to-back titles, he may have the last laugh.</p>
