      <h1>Netanyahu: Minority government would be a gift for Iran, Hamas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:06:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:06</time> by <a rel="author">Kobi Nachshoni, Yuval Karni</a></address>
      <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said a minority government relient on Arab parties would be a “dream come true” for the terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as their sponsor Iran. His comments came with just hours left for his political rival, Blue and White leader Benny Gantz, to form a coalition.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an “emergency summit” attended by all right-wing bloc factions, the prime minister reiterated the notion that a Gantz-led minority government that would include the Arab-dominated Joint List could pose a threat to Israel’s security.</p>

      <p>"A minority government supported by the Arabs is a dream government for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran,” said Netanyahu. “In Ramallah and Tehran they will be celebrating. And there is a real possibility that within the next 48 hours a minority government will be formed."</p>
      <p>He went on to emphasize he doesn’t intend to ostracize Israel’s Arab community but rather “the MKs who want support terrorism and organizations that aim to destroy Israel. I am not just crying wolf, there is indeed a wolf.”</p>
      <p>Netanyahu also lashed at the Blue and White party and its leaders, saying MK Yair Lapid would welcome the ultra-Orthodox parties with open arms into their coalition government.</p>

      <p>“Members of the ultra-Orthodox factions can attest to the talks they’ve had with them (Blue and White), Yair Lapid was ready to wear a shtreimel (fur hat worn by married Haredi Jewish men) and put on tefillin to make the parties join him.”</p>
      <p>Gantz then responded to Netanyahu’s remarks, urging him to stop “lashing out at Arab MKs,” and called on Israel’s leader to return to the negotiating table in an effort to form a broad unity government.</p>
