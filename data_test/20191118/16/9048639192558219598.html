      <h1>BBB: Viral 'Secret Sister' gift exchanges are illegal pyramid schemes</h1>

      <p><b>(CNN) - </b>The Better Business Bureau is warning against "Secret Sister" gift exchanges, saying they are <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/18854-bbb-warning-secret-sister-gift-exchange-is-illegal">illegal pyramid schemes</a>.</p>
      <p>It starts with an email or social media invitation. People are asked to buy and mail a single modest gift to a stranger and are told they will get multiple gifts in return. They're also encouraged to invite other people to the gift exchange.</p>
      <p>But the math just doesn't add up. If everyone only sends out one gift, then each gift a participant receives beyond the first leaves another participant without a gift. To put it another way, if there are 100 participants and each sends out one gift, they will put a total of 100 gifts in the mail. For everyone to get a gift, no one can receive more than one gift. It's impossible to fulfill the promise of everyone getting multiple gifts.</p>
      <p>The Better Business Bureau says the scam relies on recruiting people to keep it afloat. It says "Once people stop participating in the gift exchange, the gift supply stops as well, and leaves hundreds of disappointed people without their promised gifts."</p>
      <p>The Better Business Bureau says the U.S. Postal Service even considers these exchanges a form of gambling and participants could face fines and mail fraud charges.</p>
      <p>The Better Business Bureau recommends: Ignoring invitations to secret sister exchanges; Reporting social media invitations to them; Never giving your personal information to strangers and being wary of false claims.</p>
