      <p><b>TL;DR: </b>Whiten your teeth while also cleaning them with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/DlbLN">IGIA Total White Ultrasonic Teeth Whitener</a> for $29, a 25% savings. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>There are two types of people in this world: those who are paralyzed with fear at the mere thought of going to the dentist, and those who actually look forward to annual teeth cleanings (for some odd reason). But no matter which category you fall into, both sides have one very important thing in common: a desire to keep teeth clean and white. </p>
      <p>It's time to level up with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/DlbLN">IGIA Total White Ultrasonic Teeth Whitener</a>. This U-shaped device is actually a whitening and deep cleaning device complete with bristles and all. It works to whiten your smile using photocatalytic whitening technology, and kills 99.9% of oral bacteria, all in 30 seconds. </p>
      <p>The U-shape design gives you a full 360-degree automatic clean while the bristles massage your gums to help fend off periodontal disease. It's an intensive treatment that complements your daily brushing — think of it like face-masking for your teeth. Plus it whitens your teeth at the same time, which means you don't have to spend your precious money (and time) on overly-expensive whitening treatments that force you to sit with uncomfortable whitening trays in your mouth.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/DlbLN">IGIA Total White Ultrasonic Whitener</a> typically goes for $39, but when you use code BFSAVE15 at checkout, you can bring it home for just $24.65. At that price, it's certainly worth a try.</p>
