      <p>After Meghan Markle sued the <i>Mail on Sunday</i> and its parent company for publishing the private letter she sent to her father Thomas Markle, her lawyers have had to now submit their supporting documents to the court.</p>
      <p>In papers filed, the Duchess of Sussex’s lawyers name “false” articles the<i> Daily Mail</i> and <i>Mail on Sunday</i> published.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">Byline Investigates</a>, the documents state they “lied to readers about publishing the ‘full’ content of a letter she wrote to Thomas Markle.”</p>

      <p>“Omitted key passages because it would ‘undermine’ its ‘negative’ portrayal of the Duchess of Sussex” and “exploited Thomas Markle with questions over methods to track him down in Mexico.”</p>
      <p>The report also says the papers made up “claims about her baby shower” and Meghan’s “relationship with her mother Doria Ragland.”</p>
      <p>Other points in the document reportedly say the publication “invented” stories about the renovation of Frogmore Cottage including that they “bought a [$8,500] cooper bath, a [$852,000] soundproofing system, a yoga studio and an entire new wing of their home.”</p>
      <p>“And then insisted erroneously the ‘non-existent’ items were paid for with ‘taxpayers’ money- in a bid to poison reader against the royal couple.”</p>
      <p><i>The Mail on Sunday</i> has stood by their claims that they haven’t done anything wrong “with vigour.”</p>

      <p>A statement to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50441387">BBC</a> says, “There is nothing in this document which changes that position.”</p>
      <p>The original claim from the Duchess is that the newspaper did not publish the full letter from Thomas because it would undermine the “negative” portrayal of Meghan, but Thomas has since said that he only provided the paper with quotes.</p>
