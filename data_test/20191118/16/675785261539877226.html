      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:11:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>A Girl Scout stabbed to death in a park as she played with friends 'screamed until she could scream no more', a court heard.</p>
      <p>Today the killers of Jodie Chesney, Arron Isaacs and Svenson Ong-a-Kwie were <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-jodie-chesney-murder-teens-20905559">both jailed for life for her murder</a> in Harold Hill, east London on March 1.</p>
      <p>And at the sentencing hearing Judge Wendy Joseph QC spoke about the horrific stabbing.</p>
      <p>She said: "What matters is that they left the area, and prepared to attack and that is exactly what they did.</p>
      <p>"They came back to the park in the car of Manuel Petrovic.</p>
      <p>"He was asked to help because Ong-a-Kwie trusted him.</p>
      <p>"I reject that Svenson went back to his hostel to pick up two small bags on cannabis.</p>

      <p>"One of you plunged a knife into Jodie's back.</p>
      <p>"Jodie screamed until she could scream no more. Svenson burnt his clothes that night and the teenager disposed of his too."</p>
      <p>The pair of teenage killers were arrested on March 11 at an address in Dagenham.</p>
      <p>Both tried to flee from police and Isaacs ended up having to be talked down from a tree by officers.</p>
      <p>While running away he threw a rucksack - containing a knife, two toothbrushes and some hair mousse.</p>

      <p>The defendants denied Jodie's murder, each blaming the other for inflicting the fatal wound.</p>
      <p>But prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors that both were responsible for the killing, amid incidents of "casual violence" in the drug-dealing world.</p>
      <p>The jury deliberated for less than six hours to find them guilty last week of Jodie's murder.</p>
      <p>Judge Joseph QC handed Ong-a-Kwie a life sentence with a minimum of 26 years.</p>

      <p>She sentenced Isaacs to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure for at least 18 years.</p>
      <p>She said that Jodie's death led to a "world of anguish" for her family, which came amid "tit for tat" incidents.</p>
      <p>Jodie was the victim of "callous, casual and irresponsible violence" which had shocked the community "to the core", she said.</p>
      <p>On the evidence, she found Ong-a-Kwie was the stabber and the 17-year-old his "enthusiastic supporter".</p>
      <p>The judge lamented the impact of criminals that had "carved up areas of the capital of this country".</p>

      <p>She added: "The dangers this brings to decent law-abiding members of the public is graphically spelled out in this case."</p>
      <p>The court heard moving tributes to Jodie and the "ripple effect" her murder had among friends, family and the wider community.</p>
      <p>Mr Coyle has been left with post-traumatic stress from witnessing her murder.</p>
      <p>He said: "Jodie was funny, silly, she always made fun of me and she had a bright future ahead of her. She was full of energy and was always out doing something. We had been going out for three months.</p>

      <p>"I've never lost anyone before and for the first funeral I've gone to to be my own girlfriend's is incredibly hard. I loved her."</p>
      <p>Jodie's father, Peter Chesney, who gave up a job in the City, said: "I have lost the most precious human being I will ever know. I have no idea how I'm going to continue my life or come to terms with the loss."</p>
      <p>Her sister, Lucy, said: "Jodie will be greatly missed and the people who caused such tragedy to a whole family should hang their head in shame. You have ripped away a bright future that was destined to make a change to many lives."</p>

      <p>The court heard that Ong-a-Kwie had convictions for possessing and supplying drugs.</p>
      <p>He admitted being in breach of a six-week suspended sentence for handling stolen jewellery dating back to October last year.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old defendant had previous convictions for possessing a screwdriver, actual bodily harm, possession of cannabis as well as aggravated vehicle-taking.</p>
