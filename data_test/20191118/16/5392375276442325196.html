      <p>Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G Version Opened An Appointment<br/>4 (80%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Recently, Lenovo <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/15/lenovo-z6-pro-5g-launched-the-cheapest-5g-phone-on-the-planet/">announced its own 5G smartphone</a> and said all upcoming phones of the company will support 5G. Today, on November 18, the Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G version opened an appointment on the official website. It costs 3,299 yuan (8GB + 256GB), which is equivalent to $470. However, the handset will go on sale only on December 12. As you can see, this is by far the most cost-effective 5G smartphone. So there is every reason to think it will be quite competitive.</p>

      <p>As it is released in China first, many may wonder which networks this phone support. The Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G version supports 5G/4G dual card dual standby. As the company claims, for the realization of a stable 5G network connection, they are innovatively using a distributed antenna layout. In other words, the phone will have stable connectivity even if holding it horizontally when playing games. Plus, you can freely switch between 5G and 4G.</p>
      <p>Apart from the 5G connectivity, the Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G version uses a 6.39-inch waterdrop screen. Under the hood, there is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 flagship platform. It is also quite good for photography purposes. On the front, the device carries a 32MP selfie shooter. And on the back, there is a quad-camera, which uses a 48MP + 16MP super wide-angle + 8MP telephoto + 2MP sensors combination. The battery capacity is 4000mAh.</p>
      <p>At last, the Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G uses a 4Ã—3 Coldfront 2.0 liquid cooling system. The latter significantly increases the heat dissipation area by 20%. In the heat dissipation structure, it mainly uses various materials such as silicon sheet, copper tube, gel, graphite, etc.</p>
