        <b>Four men arrested following the discovery of a £2.5 million cannabis factory in Suffolk last month have admitted being involved in the venture.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before Ipswich Crown Court on Monday November 18 for a plea hearing were Ovidijus Urbonas, 40, of King's Cross Road, London, Egidijus Ivoskus, 41, Karolis Gumauskas, 25, and Mindaugas Ivoskus, 26, all of no fixed address.</p>
      <p>They all pleaded guilty to being concerned in the production of cannabis between October 1 and October 19 this year.</p>
      <p>Officers made the discovery on October 18 after a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act was carried out at a business park in The Street, Great Bricett, where they found hydroponic equipment and around 2,000 cannabis plants.</p>
      <p>The case was adjourned until the week commencing December 16 to allow the prosecution to consider the basis of pleas submitted by the defendants.</p>
      <p>If the basis is acceptable the men will be sentenced in January, but if not then a judge will hear evidence to determine the basis on which the defendants will be sentenced.</p>
