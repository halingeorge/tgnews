      <h1>India-Pakistan Davis Cup tie in Kazakhstan</h1>
      <h2>Injured Rohan Bopanna opts out; Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan included</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:34:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The International Tennis Federation (ITF) had informed the All India Tennis Association (AITA) that it would be Kazakhstan, if the venue for the Indian-Pakistan Davis Cup tie is confirmed to be staged on neutral ground.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan Tennis Federation had appealed to the ITF to reconsider its decision to shift the tie out of Islamabad, Pakistan, after the announcement for a neutral venue was made by ITF on November 4.</p>
      <p>Since Kazakhstan has the visa on arrival procedure, the formalities are believed to be a lot more easy than elsewhere, with the tie scheduled to be staged on November 29 and 30.</p>
      <p>Originally Pakistan had been given five days to confirm the neutral venue on November 4, but that has been stretched till November 18.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rohan Bopanna pulled out of the tie against Pakistan due to a shoulder injury, paving the way for Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan’s inclusion in the playing squad.</p>
      <p>Bopanna, who underwent an MRI scan on Monday, communicated his unavailability to non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old was expected to be paired with veteran Leander Paes for the doubles rubber of the November 29-30 tie.</p>
      <p>eft-handed Nedunchezhiyan was named as one of the three reserves in the eight-member squad announced by the AITA selection committee.</p>
      <p>“It’s disappointing not to have Rohan in the side. But we want him to protect his shoulder. He needs shots (injection) for treatment. We have an able replacement in Jeevan.</p>
      <p>He has done well on the Tour and we will have a good left-right combination,” Rajpal told PTI.</p>
      <p>Bopanna is country’s top doubles player. Now the two best-ranked players are not available for the tie. Divij Sharan is also unavailable because of his wedding reception.</p>
      <p>Nedunchezhiyan has been knocking on the doors of the Indian Davis Cup team for some time by consistently performing on the ATP tour.</p>
