      <p>Wales and Hungary meet in a winner-takes-all clash for Euro 2020 qualification in Cardiff on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Hungary won the Budapest reverse fixture 1-0 in June but Wales have gone five games unbeaten since that defeat.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency looks at the main talking points.</p>
      <h3>Handling the pressure</h3>

      <p>Gareth Bale’s return to action has certainly not gone unnoticed in Spain. Bale has not played for Real Madrid since October 5 after suffering a calf injury during the previous international break. The Spanish media reported the sight of Bale training as the ‘Miracle in Wales’. Bale managed to get an hour under his belt in the 2-0 win over Azerbaijan in Baku on Saturday. Giggs said Bale was “blowing a bit”, but those minutes provided vital preparation for Hungary. With their talisman in their team, Wales know anything is possible.</p>
      <h3>Ramsey poser</h3>
