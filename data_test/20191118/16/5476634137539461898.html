      <h1>Why Frank Lampard is the perfect Manager to get the best out of Hudson-Odoi</h1>

      <p>Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi has recently come back from a long term achilles injury that came along when he was just starting to show the true worth of his potential.</p>
      <p>The Blues academy graduate had earned a regular place under Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea, and he was delivering the goods and justifying being picked.</p>
      <p>He attracted interest from one of the worlds biggest clubs in the shape of Bayern Munich, and he has quickly become one of the hottest prospects in football.</p>
      <p>Just when it looked like Chelsea might lose their prize asset, Frank Lampard came in putting his faith in the young players, and Hudson-Odoi committed his future to the club by signing a new 5-year contract.</p>
      <p>However, since returning from injury, he is yet to show the potential that he was showing before the injury. He seems to be lacking a bit of confidence and zest about his game so far, and as a result, is playing second fiddle to Christian Pulisic and Willian in Lampard’s preferred starting eleven.</p>
      <p>This is natural, anyone coming back from an injury like this will need time to build up the strength around the injured area, as well as the mental strength and confidence to once again be able to play without fear.</p>
      <p>There is no doubting his ability and his potential is unlimited. Playing under Lampard, he is in the best possible position to get to his best.</p>
      <p>In Lampard he has one of the best man managers around, a great leader, an intelligent coach, and an all round decent person. He will handle this situation carefully and effectively, I have no doubt.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi knows that Lampard believes in his ability, but naturally the longer he sits the bench and doesn’t take his chances, doubts will creep in.</p>
      <p>But Lampard will take time to talk to him individually, and work with him alone in short periods in order to drill the best out of him.</p>
      <p>If Lampard and Hudson-Odoi both do their bit here, Chelsea have potentially one of the best young talents in the world, and let’s not forget, he’s only JUST turned 19.</p>
