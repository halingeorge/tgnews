        <b>President Trump indicated he is giving serious thought to testifying during Democrat-led impeachment hearings against him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Responding to a challenge issued by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday, Trump fired back on twitter.</p>

      <p>“Our Crazy, Do Nothing (where’s USMCA, infrastructure, lower drug pricing &amp; much more?) Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they &amp; Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sunday’s DEFACE THE NATION that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt,” the president wrote.</p>
      <p>“She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!”</p>
      <p>The Trump administration has now released transcripts of two conversations between the president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that do not clearly indicate any wrongdoing by President Trump.</p>
