      <h1>Here's what to expect from this year's PS4 Black Friday deals</h1>
      <h2>PS4 bundles, PS4 Pro, PSVR and more all on sale!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:07:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:07</time> by <a rel="author">James Pickard</a></address>
      <p>Following in the footsteps of Microsoft last week, Sony has stepped out to confirm the PS4 Black Friday deals that we can expect to see later this month.</p>
      <p>For now, all prices are in dollars as you can only read a more detailed breakdown of the deals over on the <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/11/18/playstation-2019-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-revealed/">US PlayStation Blog</a>. I'm assuming the same or similar deals will be confirmed on the European site soon enough, too.</p>
      <p>Headlining the lineup is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-08-it-looks-like-theres-going-to-be-a-new-ps4-bundle-for-black-friday">PS4 Black Friday bundle</a> we first caught wind of a couple of weeks ago. That's the 1TB PS4 with The Last of Us: Remastered, God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition for $199.99. It's a deal that still looks as good as it did a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Sony has also confirmed that there will be a PS4 Pro Black Friday deal. More specifically, the console by itself will be reduced to $299.99. They haven't confirmed any bundle deals with the beefier console model, but who's to say whether a retailer will throw in a couple of decent games and bump the price to $350?</p>

      <p>There's also good news for those of you who were holding out for any PSVR Black Friday offers. That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-26-sony-is-launching-a-new-playstation-vr-mega-pack-with-five-games">newly-announced PSVR Mega Pack</a> is already being slashed by $100. Featuring a PSVR headset, PS Camera, Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Skyrim VR, Resident Evil 7, Everybody's Golf VR and PlayStation VR Worlds, it's a strong way to start your collection of virtual reality hits.</p>
      <p>There's also another PSVR bundle that includes the headset, camera, Blood and Truth, Everybody's Golf VR, plus a pair of PS Move controllers for $50 more.</p>
      <p>Moving on to accessories, you'll be able to pick up a DualShock 4 wireless controller in all colours for $39.99. And when they say that, we assume that means it includes all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-17-heres-where-you-can-get-those-shiny-new-ps4-controller-colours">snazzy new colours that launched earlier this year</a>. Electric Purple will finally be mine. Oh, and there's a PS Gold Headset for $69.99.</p>

      <p>Finally, there are the games. Sony is promising that "select PlayStation exclusives" will fall to $19.99. A few examples include Days Gone, Spider-Man: Game of the Year Edition, MediEvil and Concrete Genie. Meanwhile, PlayStation Hits games will be just $9.99, so now's your chance to get involved with God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn for super cheap.</p>
      <p>Naturally, there's going to be a PS Plus Black Friday sale as well. Sony is promising 25 per cent off the cost of a one-year subscription, which seems to be the norm nowadays. The price hike has made this a less tempting proposal compared to before, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-x019-announces-over-50-new-games-arriving-on-xbox-game-pass">rise of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> is currently putting Sony's offering to shame.</p>
      <p>Overall, it looks like a very strong lineup of PS4 Black Friday deals from Sony this year.
