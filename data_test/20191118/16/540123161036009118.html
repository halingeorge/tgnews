      <h1>Mother and Daughter of Dead Islamic Leader Vow to Continue to Kill Jews</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:01:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Eliyahu Berkowitz</a></address>
      <blockquote>“He shall be a wild ass of a man; His hand against everyone, And everyone’s hand against him; He shall dwell alongside of all his kinsmen.”<cite><a href="http://theisraelbible.com/bible/genesis/chapter-16/#verse-12">Genesis 16:12 (The Israel Bible™)</a></cite></blockquote>
      <p>Last Tuesday, the IDF killed Baha Abu Al-Ata, a senior commander for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, in a surgical airstrike. In a twisted version of mourning, Al-Ata’s mother vowed to strap on an explosive vest and his daughter lamented that the latest wave of PIJ rockets failed to kill any Jews.</p>
      <p>PIJ responded to IDF’s by launching more than 450 rockets at Israel. For many reasons, the Israeli government made careful considerations before the airstrike. Al-Ata was responsible for numerous rocket attacks against Israel and was known to be planning more strikes. Military operations are rarely neat and clean. Al-Ata’s wife was also killed in the IDF strike. Four of their children and a neighbor were also reportedly injured.</p>
      <p><i>Kan 11</i> television aired a video statement made by Al Ata’s mother made on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“In Operation Protective Edge in 2014, they also blew up our apartment but they warned us in advance,” Al-Ata’s mother said in the video. “What did Baha do? What did he do to them? He wasn’t afraid of anything. I call to the entire military branch of the Islamic Jihad; fire rockets at Tel Aviv. And if they don’t fire rockets at Tel Aviv, I will go there and blow myself up. I will blow up the Zionists. I will put an explosive vest on right now, today! I say to the [Hamas] opposition, just as Baha chased away Netanyahu, we must blow up Netanyahu’s home.”</p>
      <p>She was referencing a rocket attack in September that targeted Ashkelon during a campaign speech Netanyahu was giving. Netanyahu was forced to flee the stage.</p>
      <p>“Allah willing, Netanyahu’s house should be destroyed,” she concluded.</p>

      <p>Apparently, these terrorist tendencies are a dominant gene in the Al-Ata family. <a href="https://sawaleif.com/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%81%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A8-504709/">Sawaleif</a>, a pro-Palestinian media, published an interview with Lyan, Al-Ata’s daughter. She related how he rarely slept at home because “the occupation” chased him (Author’s note: the term occupation refers to Israel even though Israel left Gaza in 2005, forcibly removing the 10,000 Jewish residents).</p>
      <p>“Today was my birthday and he wanted to surprise me in the morning when I woke up by being at home,” Lyan said. “But he was martyred before I saw him and took my mother with him.”</p>

      <p>Lian promised to continue her father’s path and ideology when she grows older, lamenting that the last round of rockets was not more effective.</p>
      <p>“I never heard of Jewish deaths,” she lamented in the interview.</p>
