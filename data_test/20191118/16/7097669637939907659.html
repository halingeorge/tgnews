      <p>Two drug dealing teenagers have been jailed for life for the "callous and casual" murder of girl scout Jodie Chesney, who was stabbed to death in an east London park.</p>
      <p>County lines dealer Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and his 17-year-old apprentice, Arron Isaacs had been looking to take revenge on rivals when they killed Jodie by mistake, the Old Bailey heard.</p>
      <p>The popular 17-year-old student had been relaxing with friends in Amy's Park in Harold Hill, east London, on the evening of March 1 when two shadowy figures emerged from the dark and one knifed her in the back.</p>
      <p>She screamed and collapsed in the arms of her boyfriend, Eddie Coyle, 18, as her attackers made off in a fellow drug dealer's car.</p>
      <p>Days later, they were arrested together as they fled from the rear of a house connected with the youth.</p>
      <p>The defendants denied Jodie's murder, each blaming the other for inflicting the fatal wound.</p>
      <p>But prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors that both were responsible for the killing, amid incidents of "casual violence" in the drug-dealing world.</p>
      <p>The jury deliberated for less than six hours to find them guilty last week of Jodie's murder.</p>

      <p>Judge Wendy Joseph QC handed Ong-a-Kwie a life sentence with a minimum of 26 years.</p>
      <p>She sentenced Isaacs to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure for at least 18 years.</p>
      <p>She said that Jodie's death led to a "world of anguish" for her family, which came amid "tit for tat" incidents.</p>
      <p>Jodie was the victim of "callous, casual and irresponsible violence" which had shocked the community "to the core", she said.</p>
      <p>On the evidence, she found Ong-a-Kwie was the stabber and the 17-year-old his "enthusiastic supporter".</p>
      <p>Isaacs was initially shielded by anonymity, but now he can be named after the judge lifted reporting restrictions.</p>
      <p>In doing so, she said: "What is important is that a blameless girl is dead at the hands of those engaged in and those that associate with drug dealing on the streets which Jodie and other blameless young people must live.</p>
      <p>"This death has brought great unease in the community. Those suffering, which spreads much further than Jodie's friends and family, need and have a right to known and understand how this has come about."</p>
      <p>The judge lamented the impact of criminals that had "carved up areas of the capital of this country".</p>
      <p>She added: "The dangers this brings to decent law-abiding members of the public is graphically spelled out in this case."</p>
      <p>The court heard moving tributes to Jodie and the "ripple effect" her murder had among friends, family and the wider community.</p>
      <p>Mr Coyle has been left with post-traumatic stress from witnessing her murder.</p>

      <p>He said: "Jodie was funny, silly, she always made fun of me and she had a bright future ahead of her. She was full of energy and was always out doing something. We had been going out for three months.</p>
      <p>"I've never lost anyone before and for the first funeral I've gone to to be my own girlfriend's is incredibly hard. I loved her."</p>
      <p>Jodie's father, Peter Chesney, who gave up a job in the City, said: "I have lost the most precious human being I will ever know. I have no idea how I'm going to continue my life or come to terms with the loss."</p>
      <p>Her sister, Lucy, said: "Jodie will be greatly missed and the people who caused such tragedy to a whole family should hang their head in shame. You have ripped away a bright future that was destined to make a change to many lives."</p>
      <p>The court heard that Ong-a-Kwie had convictions for possessing and supplying drugs.</p>
      <p>He admitted being in breach of a six-week suspended sentence for handling stolen jewellery dating back to October last year.</p>
      <p>Isaacs had previous convictions for possessing a screwdriver, actual bodily harm, possession of cannabis as well as aggravated vehicle-taking.</p>
