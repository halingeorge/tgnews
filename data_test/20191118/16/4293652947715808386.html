      <p>Former <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/teams/toronto-blue-jays/">Toronto Blue Jays</a> centre fielder Vernon Wells has been hired as a player agent by Gem Agency.</p>
      <p>“It’s an honour to have Vernon join the Gem Agency, as we begin our efforts to expand the staff and grow our resources,” Gem founder Greg Genske said in a statement, according to <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/11/vernon-wells-agent-gem-agency.html">MLB Trade Rumours</a>.</p>
      <p>“I have known Vernon for a long time, first as his agent and second as a friend. He is one of the most respected individuals in the game, and his insights, baseball IQ and industry reputation will make him an invaluable resource for our growing firm.”</p>
      <p>Genske founded <a href="https://www.pehub.com/2019/10/genske-and-hicks-equity-partners-launch-gem-agency/">Gem Agency in October</a> in partnership with Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks’ company. The agency represents the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Justin Turner, the Tampa Bay Rays’ Tommy Phan and Houston Astros’ Roberto Osuna, according to <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/agencydatabase">MLB Trade Rumours</a>.</p>
      <p>Wells, 40, retired from baseball in 2013 after a 15-year career, 12 of which were with the Blue Jays. He hit .270/.319/.459 with 270 home runs and was an all-star three times.</p>
