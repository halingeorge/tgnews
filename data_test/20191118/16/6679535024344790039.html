      <h1>BDU revives calendar year admissions through CDE</h1>
      <h2>Earlier this year, the varsity was awarded A+ rating by NAAC and gained eligibility for conduct of distance education programmes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:28:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/R-Krishnamoorthy-1939/" target="_blank">R. Krishnamoorthy</a></address>
      <p>Buoyed by the A+ rating awarded in the third cycle by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council, Bharathidasan University (BDU), has revived calendar year admissions through Centre for Distance Education (CDE) after a decade.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, BDU had scored 3.32 on a four-point scale in the third cycle of accreditation, gaining eligibility for conduct of distance education programmes. In the second cycle, the score was 3.16.</p>
      <p>BDU was the first among State universities to have secured A+ grade during April this year after assessment under the revised framework of NAAC. It was also placed in the 60th position among the Indian Universities in NIRF - 2019.</p>
      <p>These improvements have stood the university in good stead to scale up admissions for distance education programmes. For the academic year 2019-20 for which the CDE started the admission process during June, the enrolment for various courses in undergraduate and post graduate programmes in all domain areas ranging from Arts, Science, Humanities, Management, Technology, Visual Media and Education has touched close to 15,000, taking the total number of students learning under distance mode to 28,000. Through the calendar year admissions for the same courses from January to December, there is a likelihood to enrol 6,000 more students, A. Ilangovan, Director In-Charge, CDE, said.</p>
      <p>Like other State universities, BDU had to suffer a sharp slide in the number of students admitted in the distance education programme after the University Grants Commission notified the UGC (Open and Distance Learning) Regulations, 2017. The university had to stop operating beyond the State's jurisdiction, and had to close down the study centres in other States. At present, there are 100 personal contact programme centres, learner support centres and study centres for the BDU across Tamil Nadu, Prof. Ilangovan said.</p>
      <p>The CDE also offers PG Diploma, Diploma and Certificate programmes in specific areas. The salient feature of the distance education programme is that students are eligible to join the concurrent Diploma and PG Diploma while pursuing their college studies. It also offers scholarship to SC/ST students enrolled in the PCP centres, and provides 100 % exemption in tuition fee to candidates with disabilities.</p>
      <p>Besides, 10% concession in tuition fee is provided for PG candidates who had studied UG in Bharathidasan University's affiliated colleges.</p>
