      <h3>Proposed fireworks ban deemed an overstep</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Committee votes to maintain ban on consumer fireworks, Oct. 10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alberta’s provincial firework regulations have changed and municipalities can now implement their own bylaws. Calgary city council directed the fire chief to provide bylaw options beyond just banning consumer fireworks. He did not, and is recommending only a ban.</p>
      <p>Consumer fireworks are legal products sold across Canada through all types of retailers, yet residents are not able to purchase them in their city and no local businesses are benefiting from this multi-million dollar, legal, Canadian industry.</p>
      <p>If you are a resident wanting to use safe, legal consumer fireworks or a business owner wanting to sell them, write to Mayor Nenshi and your councillor.</p>

      <h3>Irony of food banks and taxes</h3>
      <p>Isn’t it ironic that our mayor is pictured happily shopping for the food bank, while right below is Don Braid’s column about the punishing business tax. The tax that will likely put more than a few people out of work, (and may need the support of the) food bank.</p>
      <p>Mayor and council, help businesses be viable so they can pay tax, hire staff who pay tax, and support the economy.</p>

      <h3>Scraping by</h3>
      <p>For the second time in the last two days, a snowplow went down my residential street, which is not on a bus route and is only slightly snow covered. The forecast is for mild weather for the next four or five days and no snow for the next 10 days.</p>
      <p>I don’t blame the driver, he is undoubtedly doing as he is told. But what are his managers and city council thinking? A budget is not a licence to spend money. We contract out a lot of snow removal, perhaps city management could negotiate contracts which only pay a standby fee and a variable payment as required.</p>
      <p>This is yet another example of the spendthrift ways of council and management. They should focus on how to effectively run our city on a declining tax base.</p>

      <h3>Alberta reaping what it sowed?</h3>

        <b>Re: Alberta’s premier shouldn’t take Bloc Quebecois bait, Nov. 15</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was a time when Trudeau Senior tried to implement the NEP to make Canada self-sufficient from foreign oil. The fact that the rest of the country paid to develop the oil industry in Alberta didn’t seem to matter. Alberta wasn’t interested in sharing. Lougheed’s own words were “let them freeze in the dark.” Now, Albertans can’t comprehend why Eastern Canada keeps importing oil when we could have cheap oil from Alberta.</p>
      <p>The Quebec/Alberta reliance was responsible for a free-trade agreement that killed manufacturing and Canada’s economic engine. Time for both Quebec and Alberta to stop whining. You’re both responsible for putting Canada on the path to being a Third World Country. If you don’t like it, please leave.</p>
