      <p>LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal’s Champalimaud Foundation announced on Monday the world’s largest annual prize, worth 1 million euros, for research and clinical practices aiming to control or eradicate cancer.</p>
      <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and it was responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018, according to the World Health Organisation.</p>
      <p>“For more than a century cancer, more than any other disease, has occupied our thought and fears,” the foundation said.</p>
      <p>“Despite growing knowledge on the biology of the disease and advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment, deaths from cancer are continuing to rise in most countries.”</p>
      <p>The foundation, which focuses on neuroscience and oncology research at its Lisbon base, was set up at the bequest of the industrialist Antonio Champalimaud who died in 2004.</p>
      <p>Last year a prize was awarded to seven scientists in the United States and Britain who came up with a revolutionary gene therapy cure for a rare genetic form of childhood blindness.</p>
