      <h1>Kerry Katona compares Prince Andrew 'car crash' interview to her slurred speech This Morning appearance</h1>
      <h2>Kerry made her infamous This Morning interview where she slurred her words back in 2008</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:10:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/olivia-williams/" target="_blank">Olivia Williams</a></address>
      <p>One person who is pretty happy with Prince Andrew's 'disastrous' interview is no other than Kerry Katona.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/warrington">Warrington-born</a> star posted on Instagram about her glee that her This Morning interview back in 2008 was no longer the "car crash of the century", <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kerry-katona-compares-prince-andrew-20903089">reports Mirror Online.</a></p>
      <p>The Duke of York answered questions for the first time on Saturday, November 16 for the first time about his links to paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The royal appeared to stumble and stutter as he was grilled by Newsnight host Emily Maitlis about allegations he had slept with a then 17-year-old, Virginia Roberts - who claims she was trafficked by Epstein to be a sex slave.</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew made a string of bizarre claims during the excruciating interview, including his insistence that he couldn't sweat because of a medical condition meaning Virginia's testimony that he was "profusely sweating" while dancing at a club on March, 10 2001 couldn't be true.</p>
      <p>He also said he didn't meet her at the club because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking at the time.</p>
      <p>After the interview left the nation both infuriated and in stitches, Kerry took to<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/instagram"> Instagram</a> today to express her gratitude to Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>She compared it to the time she slurred her words during a disastrous live TV appearance on This Morning more than 10 years ago.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/kerry-katona">Kerry</a> was accused of being drunk but she has since insisted medication for her bi-polar disorder had affected her speech.</p>
      <p>And today she took to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to say Prince Andrew had stolen her crown for the worst TV interview ever.</p>
      <p>Sharing a photo of herself on This Morning and one of Andrew from last night, Kez wrote: "Turns out my interview is no longer car crash of the Century no more #princeandrew cheers for that!!!</p>
      <p>"But Iâ€™m sure I seen him in ICELAND Woking buying a prawn ring!</p>
      <p>"It was very rememberable as I thought how unusual it was to see Prince Andrew with ONE POUND!!"</p>
