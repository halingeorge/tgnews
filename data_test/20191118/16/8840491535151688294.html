      <p>MAYO University Hospital is asking people to comply with visitor restrictions on C Ward (medical ward) due to a number of suspected cases of the vomiting bug (Norovirus) on the ward.</p>
      <p>In order to assist staff in curtailing the spread of this virus, it is imperative that only essential visiting takes place during this period.</p>
      <p>Children should not visit the hospital as they may be particularly susceptible to the illness.</p>
      <p>Visitors are requested to cooperate with hospital staff who are ensuring the restrictions are adhered to and visitors are also advised that they must use the alcohol hand gels supplied as they enter and leave the hospital. Infection control procedures are in place on the ward and will remain until further notice.</p>
      <p>There has been an increase in the number of cases of Norovirus in the community and anyone with recent symptoms of diarrhoea and/or vomiting or who has had contact with others who have these symptoms should not visit patients in the hospital to avoid spreading the virus to sick vulnerable patients.</p>
      <p>The hospital would like to thank members of the public for their cooperation.</p>
