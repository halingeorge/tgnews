      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/martha-hunt/">Martha Hunt</a> gave her fans something to talk about this weekend when she shared a new photo to <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> that brought some serious heat to her page.</p>
      <p>The snap was shared on Sunday, November 17, and instantly proved to be popular among her 3.1 million followers. In the photo, the Victoria’s Secret Angel stood in front of a white wall decorated with wooden shelves and a large, circular mirror. She posed with her hands on her hips as she stared down the camera with a sultry gaze and stripped down to nothing more than a black bra, leaving little to the imagination.</p>
      <p>Martha’s decision to ditch her top made for a serious showing of skin that her fans hardly seemed bothered by. Plenty of cleavage was left well within eyesight in the snap, which was only enhanced thanks to the bra’s push-up style. The topless look also allowed for the model to show off her flat midsection and sculpted abs.</p>
      <p>On her lower half, the blond bombshell rocked a pair of light wash jeans that boasted a trendy button-fly closure. The bottoms clung tight to Martha’s hips in all of the right ways, highlighting her toned legs and killer curves. Meanwhile, its waistband sat low on her hips, accentuating her trim waist and chiseled torso even more.</p>
      <p>Martha left her look simple, opting not to add any accessories to the look and let her incredible figure take center stage. She wore her blond hair down, with some of it spilling in front of her shoulder while the rest fell behind her back. She also rocked a simple makeup look in the snap that included a light dusting of blush and mascara, allowing her natural beauty and striking features to shine.</p>
