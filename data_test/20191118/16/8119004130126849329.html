        <b>The government has taken legal action against 2,500 unscrupulous traders for creating an artificial crisis of onion in the market, the commerce secretary says.</b>

      <p>Jafar Uddin read out a written statement to the media in three minutes and left the press conference without taking questions.</p>
      <p>Highlighting several measures taken by the government to cool down the onion market, the official said, “The onion market will return to normal very soon.”</p>
      <p>Myanmar has recently increased its export value of onions four times and local prices have increased partly due to Cyclone Bulbul, according to Jafar.</p>
      <p>“In this situation, the steps have been taken to import onions as per the prime minister’s order," he said.</p>

      <p>The government is flying in onions from Egypt, Turkey and China. “You’ll be happy to know that the first shipment of onions by S Alam Group will arrive in Bangladesh tomorrow,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It takes about one and a half months to bring onions through the sea route. A significant shipment of consignments is now on the way to Bangladesh through the route.”</p>
      <p>Onion prices have continued to surge since Sept 29 when India banned exports to control domestic prices, prompting the government to take several measures to tame the spiralling price.</p>
      <p>Prices rose to Tk 180 a kg, which is a Tk 30 jump in two days, after Cyclone Bulbul that struck the coastline on Nov 9 squeezed supply. The prices continued to rise and hovered around Tk 250, a record in Bangladesh, over the weekend.</p>
