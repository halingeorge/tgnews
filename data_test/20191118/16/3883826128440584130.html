        <b>Japanese tidying guru Marie Kondo, who made her name preaching against clutter, is launching an online store selling homeware and fashion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The author and media star has added a collection of more than 100 items that "spark joy" to her KonMari website.</p>
      <p>The range includes, among other things, an $86 (£66.3) scented candle and a $42 (£32.4) flower bouquet tote bag.</p>
      <p>In a letter posted on the site, Ms Kondo said her tidying method "isn't about getting rid of things".</p>
      <p>Instead, she wrote: "It's about heightening your sensitivity to what brings you joy.</p>
      <p>"Once you've completed your tidying, there is room to welcome meaningful objects, people and experiences into your life."</p>

      <p>Ms Kondo's books on organising have sold millions of copies and led to a spin-off series for Netflix.</p>
      <p>Her online store, which also sells storage containers and trays, opened on Monday. Its debut comes a few months after Ms Kondo announced <a href="https://rakuten.today/blog/why-were-partnering-with-marie-kondo.html">a partnership with Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten</a>.</p>
      <p>The launch was greeted with a few eye rolls on social media.</p>
      <p>"So now #mariekondo wants you to buy as much of her stuff as possible #ironic", <a href="https://twitter.com/SamLaskaris/status/1196423209853300736?s=20">wrote one person on Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Ms Kondo said the idea for a store came out of reader questions about what items she likes to use. But she said she is not trying to encourage consumerism.</p>
      <p>"What's most important to me is that you surround yourself with items that spark joy," she said. "If the bowl that you're using currently sparks joy for you, I don't encourage replacing it at all."</p>
