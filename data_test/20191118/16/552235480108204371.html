      <p>A charity ball to create a memorial tree for bereaved parents in the region helped fundraisers smash their target recently.</p>
      <p>The Little Footprints Ball at the Easterbrook Hall brought more than 300 people together to help the D&amp;G Baby Loss Awareness Tree group hit their £18,000.</p>
      <p>The group was set up by Dumfries couple Lauren and Chris Brydson who have lost five children. Together with friends and family, they hope to bring a tree of tranquillity to the area to “create a positive out of something negative”.</p>
      <p>The ball raked in £7,605 which means £18,000 has been raised since April this year through a number of other events.</p>
      <p>Organiser Lauren said: “We had an amazing turnout at the ball and we’ve been humbled by the support and reaction that we’ve had from the local community.</p>

      <p>“We’re absolutely thrilled with the money that we raised on the night.</p>
      <p>“It’s also been really good to see people come together to openly discuss a subject that is not often talked about.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to thank committee members Jill Cameron, Karen Little, Becky Little, Lindsay Temlett, Nicole Clark, Rachael Brown, Louise Copeland and Claire Burgess for all that they have done. I’d also like to thank everyone who came on Saturday night, who donated prizes and people with other fundraisers throughout the year.”</p>
