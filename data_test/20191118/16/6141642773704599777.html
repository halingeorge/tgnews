      <p>With his stock in the pro-game in Australia having been boosted in his previous outing – despite it being his first defeat – former Leonis ABC man Kennedy again rose to the occasion, but this time to win the ten three-minute round contest on a split decision.</p>
      <p>Once more the fight was hailed as a classic of its kind – the Australian public have certainly taken to the veteran Islander, who won the New South Wales welterweight title in 2015. Social media and commentators Down Under have already spoken of the bout as a ‘fight of the year’ contender.</p>
      <p>Former U23 Muratti footballer Kennedy, aged 36, was again giving several years away to his opponent, Kaoullas ‘The Golden Greek’, but his heart proved as strong as ever taking him through a knockdown late in the second to the split-points victory, with the three judges scoring being: 95/94; 95/96; 96/93.</p>
      <p>It was a gruelling contest from start to finish, but despite having several cuts to the face, the Jerseyman, a stonemason by trade who now lives in Australia, kept strong to take the decision.</p>
