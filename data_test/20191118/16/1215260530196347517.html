        <b>A flash flood watch for low-lying and flood-prone across Jamaica remains in effect.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A flash flood watch means that flash flooding is possible and residents are advised to take precautionary measures and be ready for quick action if flooding is observed or if a warning is issued.</p>
      <p>The weather alert remains in effect until 5 o'clock this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Meteorological Service says a slow-moving Cold Front across Jamaica has been producing unstable weather conditions across northern and southwestern parishes during the night.</p>
      <p>Satellite imagery and rainfall data indicate that periods of light to moderate showers and thunderstorms have been affecting sections of mainly northern and southeastern parishes during the night.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Cold Front is projected to linger across the island, resulting in an increase in unstable weather conditions today through to Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The forecast is for cloudy conditions with periods of showers and isolated thunderstorms, which could be heavy at times.</p>
      <p>Flash flooding is, therefore, possible over low-lying and flood-prone areas of all parishes.</p>
      <p>The Meteorological Service says it will continue to monitor the situation.</p>
