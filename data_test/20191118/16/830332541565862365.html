      <p>LA CROSSE, Wis - A La Crosse man accused of threatening to bomb the police department is under arrest.</p>
      <p>Police say the 25-year-old man called 911 about 8:30 p.m. Sunday and said there was a bomb in the building and that every police officer would die.</p>
      <p>Investigators traced the call to the man's home and to his phone. The La Crosse Tribune says officers executed a search warrant about 1:30 a.m. Monday, seized the phone from which the call was made and arrested the man.</p>
      <p>Officers searched City Hall, the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse Police Department and the La Crosse Sheriff's Department and did not find explosives.</p>
      <p>The man initially told police the phone wasn't his, but later admitted drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana before making the threatening call.</p>
