      <h1>ESPN Believes 9 Teams Have A Shot At The College Football Playoff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:04:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>With Baylor and Minnesota both suffering their first losses of the season, the college football playoff field has narrowed a bit. But while there are still three undefeated teams that are basically in if they win out, that fourth spot is still up for grabs.</p>
      <p>ESPNâ€™s analytics have calculated odds of all of the teams getting into the CFP and winning the title. Based on the results, there are only nine teams remaining that have somewhat of a shot of getting in.</p>
      <p>Ohio State, LSU, and Clemson all have overwhelming odds of making the CFP. But beyond that, things get very dicey with six other teams from four conferences.</p>
      <p>Here are the nine teams ESPN calculates have the best odds of reaching the College Football Playoff:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ohio State: 86% chance to make CFP, 35% chance to win the title</li>
        <li>LSU: 85% chance to make CFP, 16% chance to win the title</li>
        <li>Clemson: 84% chance to make CFP, 25% chance to win the title</li>
        <li>Alabama: 44% chance to make CFP, 12% chance to win the title</li>
        <li>Georgia: 39% chance to make CFP, 6% chance to win the title</li>
        <li>Oregon: 28% chance to make CFP, 3% chance to win the title</li>
        <li>Oklahoma: 11% chance to make CFP, 1% chance to win the title</li>
        <li>Penn State: 10% chance to make CFP, 1% chance to win the title</li>
        <li>Utah: 8% chance to make CFP, &lt;1% chance to win the title</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Minnesota was giving a sliver of a chance to get in, but is realistically out now that the Golden Gophers have one loss.</p>
      <p>Teams like Penn State, Georgia, Oregon, and Utah will in all likelihood need to win their conference title to get in.</p>
      <p>Only Alabama has a chance to get in by simply winning their remaining regular season games.</p>
      <p>Did ESPN miss any teams that could still get in?</p>
