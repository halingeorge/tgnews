      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:55:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://info.scoop.co.nz/Bayleys" target="_blank">Bayleys</a></address>
      <p>One of the largest multi-tenanted commercial blocks on the northern outskirts of Hamilton has been placed on the market for sale.</p>
      <p>The property at 593 Te Rapa Road consists of a 1,543 square metre dual-storey unit titled premises sitting on freehold industrial zoned land occupied by a range of retail and commercial entities - including three nationally-known brands.</p>
      <p>Combined, the eight tenancies within rectangular-shaped building at 593 Te Rapa Road generate an annual net rental of $308,000 plus GST. The tenancy schedule includes is headlined by Resene Paints occupying 727 square metres of space on a lease running through to 2025 with two further six-year rights of renewal, paying annual net rental of $151,500 plus GST.</p>
      <p>Fellow nationally-branded café lunch bar Robert Harris Café occupying a 189 square metres of space on a lease running through until 2024, with a further eight-year right of renewal, paying annual net rental of $50,000 plus GST.</p>
      <p>Travel agency Hello World also occupies 96.7 square metres of space on a lease running through until 2025, with two further two-year rights of renewal, paying annual net rental of $36,000 plus GST.</p>
      <p>Further toward the back of the building, mobile retailing firm Ace Marketing Extreme occupies 128 square metres of space on a lease running through until 2020, with one further six-year right of renewal, paying annual net rental of $26,600 plus GST.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, retailing support company Plumbing Plus BKL occupies three offices on a lease running through until 2022, with two further two-year rights of renewal, paying annual gross rental of $20,340 plus utilities.</p>
      <p>Also in the premises, financial management business Enprise Solutions occupies 50 square metres of space on a pending three-year lease paying $18,000 plus GST and utilities, while infrastructure engineering firm NZ Civil occupies two offices on a lease running through until 2021, paying annual gross rental of $12,000 plus utilities.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the tenancy list relocation services provider Hamilton Movers occupying an office on a lease running through until 2021, with two further two-year rights of renewal, paying annual gross rental of $8,000 plus GST.</p>
      <p>The site also has car parking for 46 staff and customer vehicles, and was extensively refurbished to its current A-grade standards in 2006.</p>
      <p>The land and buildings at 593 Te Rapa Road are now being marketed for sale at auction on December 5 through Bayleys Hamilton. Salespeople Alex ten Hove and Mike Swanson said there was considerable rental upside within the property – with some 120 square metres of office space currently vacant.</p>
      <p>“The split-risk tenancy make up of the building, combined with the vacant space, means the property could appeal to both investors or owner-occupier buyers looking for office premises in what is predominantly a light industrial and retail part of Hamilton,” Mr Swanson said.</p>
      <p>“Facing directly onto Te Rapa Road, lead tenant Resene ColourShop and its neighbour Robert Harris Café jointly sit at the base of the Italian style corner tower – and along with Hello World enjoy a prominent position overlooking a main arterial route which has some 30,000 vehicles passing their doors every week day,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Their position at the front of the property complements the neighbouring tenancies within the block which have office-based commercial-focuses to their operations and don’t need the high public profile.</p>
      <p>“Parking for all of the rear tenancies comes off an access right-of-way running along the side of the premises and leading to the rear of the building.”</p>
      <p>The Te Rapa location for sale is surrounded by such big-box retailing outlets as Bunnings, PB Tech’, Guthrie Bowron, Target Furniture, and the new Inland Revenue Department offices.</p>
