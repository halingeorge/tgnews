      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> are struggling to understand former Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle because of her thick accent.</p>
      <p>After watching the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-teary-as-ant-mcpartlin-makes-his-return/">first episode of the new series</a>, which aired on Sunday evening (17.11.19), a number of viewers admitted they couldn't make out what the Northern Irish singer was saying.</p>

      <p>Someone else tweeted: "100% gonna need subtitles for Nadine."</p>
      <aside>Her accent is still sooo strong.</aside>
      <p>"Can we get subtitles for Nadine Coyle? Even being from NI, I still have no idea what she's saying," said a fourth.</p>

      <p>When Nadine became the second celeb to enter the running by joining former footballer Ian Wright on the I'm A Celebrity yacht, she joked that she might be hard to understand.</p>
      <p>They both sipped cocktails in the sun as they waited for the other famous faces to arrive and Ian said: "I Love your accent."</p>
      <p>Nadine told him: "If you ever don't understand anything, say and I'll say it as many times as you want, only for you."</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the opening episode, Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway were voted to do the first bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>The American reality star and Good Morning Britain presenter were selected to compete in a trial called Bugged Off, but <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-divided-over-caitlyn-and-kate-doing-the-bushtucker-trial/">viewers at home were divided over the choice</a>.</p>
      <p>Some slammed it as 'predictable', while others thought Caitlyn and Kate made the perfect pairing.</p>

      <p>The series got underway with plenty of laughs, but figures show that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebritys-launch-episode-pulls-in-one-million-less-viewers-than-last-year-as-ant-mcpartlin-returns/">almost one million fewer people decided to tune in</a>.</p>
      <p>According to stats, 10 million people decided to watch last night - compared with 10.9 million in 2018, when Ant was temporarily replaced by This Morning's Holly Willoughby.</p>
      <p>That might come as no surprise given viewers' reactions on Twitter to the "disappointing" line-up, which some have said <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-viewers-call-out-worst-line-up-ever/">pales in comparison to last year's camp</a>.</p>
