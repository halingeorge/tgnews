        </ul>
        <p>Speaking to Nick Grimshaw on Radio 1 (November 14), Healy admitted that he is going to see <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/my-chemical-romance-reunion-tour-announcement-rumours-2019-2020-2563164">the band’s forthcoming reunion show in L.A</a>. and that he is a big fan of the emo icons.</p>
        <p>“I’m not too happy about him [Way] coming back for his emo lord crown once I’ve announced myself as quite overtly being that. He’s gonna come back and try and claim it isn’t he? Emo grandad more like Gerard, thank you, off you pop,” he joked when asked by a fan if the 1975 would collaborate with MCR.</p>

        <p>He continued: “No, I love My Chemical Romance. I don’t think we’d ever collab but I don’t see why not.”</p>
        <p>MCR announced their return at the end of last month with a reunion show at Los Angeles’ Shrine Expo Hall on Friday, December 20.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, earlier this month (November 13), fans of The 1975 were <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fans-of-the-1975-are-planting-trees-to-honour-the-bands-pledge-to-climate-change-2567773">called on to plant trees in the band’s honour</a> and in a commitment to fighting climate change.</p>
