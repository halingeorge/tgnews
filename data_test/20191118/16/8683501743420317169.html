      <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is in an interesting place right now, as we're in the interim period between Phases. Every single installment in Phase Three was a critical and box office success, including <i>Ant-Man and The Wasp</i>. The first release after <i>Infinity War</i> backtracked to reveal Scott's life, and introduced a slew of new characters in the process. One of them was the villainous Ghost, played by Hannah John-Kamen. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2457180/ant-man-and-the-wasps-evangeline-lilly-shares-glimpse-of-deleted-scene">And a deleted scene</a> from the sequel added two more Marvel heroes to her origin.</p>
      <p>Ghost was the primary antagonist for <i>Ant-Man and The Wasp</i>. That is, until the very final moments of the third act. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2454583/michelle-pfeiffer-really-helped-ant-man-and-the-wasps-ghost">Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne</a> ultimately ends up being empathetic toward the villain's struggles, and uses her Quantum Realm abilities to (temporarily) stabilize her. But it turns out that Janet and Hank Pym were originally part of the character's backstory. At least, according to a deleted scene from the Infinity Saga box set.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2458502/watch-two-deleted-scenes-from-ant-man-and-the-wasp-including-one-with-michelle-pfeiffer">A new deleted scene</a> has surfaced thanks to the massive Infinity Saga box set (via <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/11/17/ant-man-and-the-wasp-deleted-scene-ghost-creation/">Comic Book</a>) which includes all 23 installments in the MCU through Phase Three aka <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481663/the-mcu-infinity-saga-box-set-looks-awesome-and-costs-everything">The box set</a> will also include plenty of never-before-seen bonus features, including deleted scenes. The one in question sees revealed that Hank and Janet were present during Laurence Fishburne's Bill Foster was experimenting on her daughter in order to give her phasing abilities. This makes Janet and Ghost's connection all the more significant, as she was privy to the events that followed the villain's life of pain.</p>
      <p>Ultimately this sequence was cut from <i>Ant-Man and The Wasp</i>, likely to simplify the story and keep the runtime tight. But I have to wonder the emotional impact it might have had on Ghost's story, and her fate. After trying forcibly to take Janet's Quantum Realm energy, Hope's mother ended up volunteering to help the young enhanced woman. It was a touching moment of intimacy, and one of the few times in the MCU where a villain is given a second chance.</p>
      <p>I have to wonder what happened to Ghost after the events of <i>Ant-Man and The Wasp</i>. The <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464955/how-the-russo-brothers-contributed-to-ant-man-and-the-wasps-credits-scene">film's mid-credits scene</a> featured Scott Lang entering the Quantum Realm in an attempt to harvest it's energy for Ghost. But Thanos' snap happens, with Ant-Man trapped in the mysterious setting while Hope, Hank, and Janet were dusted. This fate would <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2455537/why-ant-man-and-the-wasps-director-loves-that-crazy-mid-credits-scene">presumably be disastrous</a> for Ava/Ghost, who was relying on the energy to stabilize her abilities and free her from excruciating pain.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>One possibility is that Ghost was snapped too, which might have actually been merciful considering the character's alternative. Namely, that she is one again in constant pain, and unable to find any relief on our world. Answers will eventually arrive with <i>Ant-Man 3</i>, although that movie hasn't been given an official release date yet.</p>
      <p>The Infinity Saga box set isn't the only place Marvel can find new deleted scenes from the massive shared universe. Disney+ launched last week, with bonus footage including unseen footage from <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.
