      <p>An RTÉ journalist has opened up about the racial abuse she has received both online and in real life.</p>
      <p>Zainab Boladale, 23, started working in RTÉ in 2017 as a presenter for news2day and currently works with Nationwide.</p>
      <p>Ms Boladale is a fluent Irish speaker and comes from Clare, having moved to Ennis when she was four.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, she took to Twitter to highlight some of the racism directed at her online.</p>
      <p>"For months and months, a YouTube channel constantly compiled videos of me from my account/social/TV etc," she wrote.</p>
      <p>"When I used to write articles they’d post it on racist forums - Talking about racism when you’re a POC [person of colour] is tiring because the experience feels overwhelming.</p>
      <p>"After months of reporting the channel - YouTube finally took it down (I’m guessing others featured on that channel complained too)."</p>

      <p>Attaching screeshots, the comments on the videos contained racist and insulting language.</p>
      <p>Speaking to RTÉ's News at One, Ms Boladale said she spoke up "out of frustration".</p>
      <p>"I think I was just felt really fed up," she said.</p>
      <p>"And there was just a lot out there in the media about the questions about racism, whether or not Ireland was racist."</p>
      <p>She said she felt "irritated that we were still having this conversation, because I felt like we're constantly having the conversation about what is racist and what isn't.</p>
      <p>"It's clear what is and what isn't."</p>
      <p>Ms Boladale also highlighted that she also experienced racism in real life while working on a story about Direct Provision.</p>
      <p>"I was out recently on a report and someone stopped me in a field," she said.</p>
      <p>"I was in the midlands and someone stopped me and was questioning whether or not...I think they had thought that I was someone from Direct Provision."</p>
      <p>Ms Boladale said the person asked where she was from. When she replied "Clare" the person laughed and asked again.</p>
      <p>"Then he asked a third time and I got that he wanted to know where I'm 'originally from'."</p>
      <p>When she said Nigeria, Ms Boladale said the person replied saying "You have very good English for a Nigerian girl.</p>
      <p>She said the man laughed "condescendingly" when she told him she was an RTÉ reporter.</p>

      <p>Ms Boladale said the incident "put a downer" on her day adding that it was tough "when you're trying to do your job and you have these things thrown at you."</p>
      <p>Jon Williams, Managing Director of RTÉ News and Current Affairs, said in a statement:</p>
      <p>"All of us in RTÉ are disgusted that anyone should have to put up with such vile behaviour.</p>
      <p>"Zainab's grace and dignity stands in sharp contrast to the cowardice of the bullies who've abused her.</p>
      <p>"Sadly harassment of journalists is nothing new. But we expect the social media companies to act quickly and decisively to protect victims.</p>
      <p>"All of her RTÉ family stand with Zainab and abhor any kind of racism."</p>
