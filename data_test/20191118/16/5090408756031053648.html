      <h4>Disable the Always-On Display</h4>
      <p>The display is one of the biggest drains on your battery, and while <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-keep-samsung-galaxy-s10-screen-on">the always-on display is pretty energy efficient</a>, you can get more mileage out of each charge by turning it off.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Start the Settings app.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Tap “Lock screen.”</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> Turn off “Always On Display” by swiping its button to the left.</p>

      <h4>Uninstall power-hungry apps</h4>
      <p>You can check which apps are using the most power, and choose to either use them less frequently, or uninstall them.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Start the Settings app.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Tap “Device care” and then tap “Battery” in the lower left corner.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> To the right of usage by app, choose “Today” or “1 week” to see how much battery usage each of your apps consumes over that time period.</p>

      <h4>Turn off features you don’t use</h4>
      <p>The Galaxy S10 comes with a slew of features that you rarely use and might not even be aware exist. Many of these run perpetually in the background, meaning you’re potentially wasting battery life on things you probably don’t use.</p>
      <p>Features like these are scattered all around the Settings app, but a great place to start is in the advanced features section.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Start the Settings app.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Tap “Advanced features.”</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> Explore the list of advanced features and turn off items you don’t recognize or don’t use. You can always turn features back on again later, and continue to experiment with settings that can save you valuable battery life.</p>
