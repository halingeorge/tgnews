      <p>Munster have confirmed that scrum-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/alby-mathewson/">Alby Mathewson</a> will leave the province following Saturday’s Heineken Champions Cup game against Racing 92.</p>
      <p>The Kiwi scrum-half originally joined the province on a three month short-term deal in August 2018, but ended up staying at Thomond Park for 15 months.</p>
      <p>Having quickly made his impact felt at the province, Mathewson ended up playing 21 times for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> last season, with the IRFU twice extending his contract. He has made a further six appearances this season.</p>
      <p>Munster are well-stocked at scrum-half with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/conor-murray/">Conor Murray</a> returning from he World Cup fit and available for selection. Head coach Johann Van Grann can call on <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/nick-mccarthy/">Nick McCarthy</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/craig-casey/">Craig Casey</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/neil-cronin/">Neil Cronin</a> for cover, along with Academy player Jack Stafford.</p>

      <p>With so many players available in the position, Munster have now confirmed that Mathewson’s contract will end following this weekend’s round two Champions Cup game. The player took to Twitter to thank the club and the Munster supporters as he prepares for his next move.</p>
      <p>“Just want to say thank you to the whole Munster Rugby organisation for having me,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“I’m lucky to have played for such a world class and historical club. Love my team-mates and will miss them a lot. Thanks Limerick for having me. To all the supporters you guys are unreal.”</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old will now look for a new club as a free agent. He has a long list of previous clubs, including Toulon, Bristol, the Blues, and the Hurricanes.</p>
