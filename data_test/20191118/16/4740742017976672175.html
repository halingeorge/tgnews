      <p>A prisoner awaiting trial for murder was found dead in his cell at HMP Bristol an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Shaun Dewey was discovered in his cell on April 13, 2018.</p>
      <p>An inquest at Avon Coroners Court heard that Mr Dewey had been in prison since September 2017 and was on remand for the murder of Andrew Owen,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/shaun-dewey-hmp-bristol-died-3476769">Mr Dewey had been charged with the murder</a> and grievous bodily harm of Mr Owen following an altercation at a property in Bewdley on September 17, 2017.</p>
      <p>Initially Mr Dewey had been remanded in custody at HMP Hewell in Redditch.</p>
      <p>However he was transferred to Bristol after he started to self-harm.</p>

      <p>Despite attempts to revive him, Mr Dewey, from Redditch, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard how Mr Dewey had sparked a code blue incident while at HMP Hewell after he was found in his cell with cuts on November 14 which required hospital treatment.</p>
      <p>Mr Dewey who said he felt under threat from associates of his victim, was moved to HMP Bristol on January 4.</p>
      <p>On arrival in Bristol an ACT - assessment, care in custody and teamwork- was put in place.</p>
      <p>An ACT is put in place, the inquest heard, when a prisoner is judged of being at risk of self harm or suicide.</p>
      <p>The ACT is used to identify and support those prisoners at risk of self harm or suicide and suggests how often they should be observed, and whether mental health intervention is required.</p>
      <p>An assessment the day after his arrival at Bristol, the inquest heard, judged that although Mr Dewey was anxious and suffering with depression he had no suicidal thoughts and was a low risk.</p>
      <p>Regular assessments of Mr Dewey were carried out although it was deemed at the time he did not need a mental health assessment and if his condition deteriorated he should see his GP.</p>
      <p>At a review on January 13, Mr Dewey told staff that he feared ‘reprisals were coming.’</p>

      <p>On January 20 during an assessment with senior prison officer John Penman, Mr Dewey appeared ‘tearful and anxious’ and told staff he was concerned about his family who were getting abuse.</p>
      <p>Mr Dewey continued to feel anxious and told prison staff he wanted to move off D wing onto the vulnerable persons unit (VPU).</p>
      <p>The inquest heard how he was not taking his medication properly as he was too fearful to come out of his cell to collect it.</p>
      <p>Dr Glover saw Mr Dewey on January 29 where he said he wanted to move off D wing.</p>
      <p>A referral to the mental health team was made where it was judged that Mr Dewey’s issues were ‘circumstancial’ rather than anything underlying and moves were made to move him to the VPU.</p>
      <p>Dr Glover told the inquest: “His mental health problems were within those manageable by a GP.”</p>
      <p>Mr Dewey was moved to the VPU on February 1 but he continued to suffer with anxiety and a request for a mental health assessment made.</p>
      <p>However this request was refused and a referral made to the anxiety management group.</p>
      <p>On March 19 it was reported by prison staff that Mr Dewey was anxious, not eating and self-segregating, refusing to come out of his cell apart from to collect his meals.</p>
      <p>He was put on the list for one to one sessions to talk about his anxiety but there was a waiting list.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard how Mr Dewey was keen to see his family but was worried about having visits in the main hall with other prisoners.</p>

      <p>Mr Dewey was told adjustments could be made to the arrangements and a visit was being booked.</p>
      <p>A report on the prison reporting system NOMIS on April 7 raised concerns Mr Dewey was not mixing with anyone on the wing and was suffering ‘terrible anxiety about his offence and being targeted.</p>
      <p>However there was no concerns that Mr Dewey was at risk of self harming.</p>
      <p>On April 11 the prison’s PACT team saw Mr Dewey and told him the process had started for him to see his family alone at the prison but that this would take time.</p>
      <p>Alice Risdale told the inquest: “He seemed more upbeat and in better spirits.”</p>
      <p>The inquest heard that on the morning of April 13 prison staff did their usual roll call.</p>
      <p>They reported that the previous night Mr Dewey had put up playing cards in the observation panel to his cell.</p>
      <p>When prison staff banged on the cell door, Mr Dewey knocked the cards off and was seen to go back to his bed.</p>
