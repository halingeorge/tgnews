      <h1>Architecture Firm Designs Smart Forest City Cancun That's Fully Self-Sufficient</h1>
      <h2>Stefano Boeri Architetti designed the Mexican futuristic city that will have nearly double the amount of trees compared to residents.</h2>

      <p>Imagine living surrounded by trees and plants, with everything you need either within walking or cycling distance. All your energy is derived from the sun or water, and to top all things off you still have access to world renowned lectures and cultural events. </p>
      <p>This is precisely what architecture firm, <a href="https://www.stefanoboeriarchitetti.net/en/project/smart-forest-city-cancun/">Stefano Boeri Architetti,</a> in Milan has proposed.</p>
      <p>Their innovative nature-focused city is called Smart Forest City Cancun — as its to be based in Mexico — and is a model for <a href="https://inhabitat.com/first-smart-forest-city-in-mexico-will-be-100-food-and-energy-self-sufficient/">sustainable urban planning</a>. </p>

      <h3>The details of Smart Forest City Cancun</h3>
      <p>The city was created for the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/first-smart-forest-city-in-mexico-will-be-100-food-and-energy-self-sufficient/">property developer</a>, <a href="http://www.grupokarims.com/">Grupo Karim</a>, as an alternative to plans for a shopping district in Cancun, Mexico. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.stefanoboeriarchitetti.net/en/project/smart-forest-city-cancun/">Stefano Boeri Architetti's plan</a> would reforest the <b>557-hectare</b> site and would be <b>100%</b> food and energy self-sufficient. </p>
      <p>Smart Forest City would be able to house <b>130,000 residents</b>, and have <b>260,000 trees</b>. In total there would be over <b>7.5 million plants</b> across the <b>400 hectares</b> allocated for plants. These have all been carefully selected by botanist and landscape architect, <a href="http://www.lauragatti.it/">Laura Gatti.</a> </p>

      <p>According to the firm's<a href="https://www.stefanoboeriarchitetti.net/en/project/smart-forest-city-cancun/"> press release</a>, the plan is to give back to nature through the zone's numerous public parks, private gardens, green roofs and facades. The plan is for the Smart Forest City to absorb <b>116,000 billion tonnes</b> of carbon dioxide, with <b>5,800 tonnes</b> of CO2 stocked every year. </p>

      <h3>How would the city function?</h3>
      <p>With the help of Germany-based <a href="https://transsolar.com/">Transsolar</a>, the Smart Forest City will be surrounded by a ring of solar panels and agricultural fields irrigated by an underwater maritime pipe. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Water is key to the entire project. It'll be gathered in a massive basin by the entrance to the city, where a desalination tower will also be located. Once properly desalinated, the water will be distributed through navigable canals across the entire area. Moreover, a number of water gardens will be created to help fight any potential floods.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In terms of mobility, the residents would park their vehicles at the edges of the city as the city would operate with a <a href="https://www.stefanoboeriarchitetti.net/en/project/smart-forest-city-cancun/">Mobility in Chain</a> system. Once their vehicles dropped off, residents would rely fully on internal electric and semi-automatic mobility. Walking and cycling won't be dissuaded either. </p>

        <figcaption>How life would look like in the city. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.stefanoboeriarchitetti.net/en/project/smart-forest-city-cancun/">Stefano Boeri Architetti</a></i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Furthermore, because the city would function so innovatively and environmentally-focused, it would become a center for advanced <a href="https://www.stefanoboeriarchitetti.net/en/project/smart-forest-city-cancun/">research</a> and able to host worldwide events and lectures from renowned universities and companies. </p>
      <p>If they win the project, Stefano Boeri Architetti's urban concept would hopefully become a sustainability and green infrastructure model for future urban planning.</p>
