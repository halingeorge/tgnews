      <h1>JAAC to observe fast on November 22</h1>

      <p>The Joint Advocates Associations Action Committee has called for a one-day fast on November 22 at the district court complexes urging the State government to withdraw the amendment made in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission rules with respect to selection of junior level judicial officers.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference here on Monday, JAAC chairman P. Nandakumar claimed that the amendment made would result in advocates from other States who did not have any exposure to the local language take up the examination and get posted in the lower courts in Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>The move would not only hinder the judicial process at the lower courts as the newly appointed Magistrates would not understand the proceedings conducted in Tamil but also affect the chances of Tamil advocates becoming judicial officers, he added.</p>
      <p>Hence, he said, the JAAC would be observing a fast.</p>
