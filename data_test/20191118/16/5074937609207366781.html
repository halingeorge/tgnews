      <h1>Amen Scientific Hospital marks ‘World Diabetes Day’ in Ashaiman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:31:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">Hafsa Obeng, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 18, GNA – As part of efforts to commemorate this year’s World Diabetes Day, Amen Scientific Herbal and Alternative Medical Hospital has organised an awareness campaign on diabetes at the Ashiaman main market.</p>
      <p>The campaign was to highlight and stress on the need for families to take keen interest in the condition and protect family members from getting affected.</p>
      <p>The global theme for this year’s celebration announced by the International Diabetes Federation is: ‘Family and Diabetes’.</p>
      <p>Sheikh Dr Amin Bonsu Chief Executive Officer, of Amen Scientific Herbal and Alternative Medical Hospital, said, “The focus of our campaign is to enlighten the market women on the causes and effects of diabetes, how to protect their families from acquiring it and to be able to detect early enough if family members show any sign of it, as well as treatment options available in other health institutions.”</p>
      <p>He said diabetes is a condition that is gradually rising across the globe, with about 428 million people globally affected per the 2017 World Health Organisation statistics.</p>
      <p>He said according to the Ghana Diabetes Association, there are also about 518,400 cases of diabetes in Ghana in 2017 alone and these figures have increased over the years at an alarming rate and if it continues for the next thirty years, about half of the population of the world would be diabetic.</p>
      <p>He said diabetes occurs when blood glucose or blood sugar is too high. The pancreas also produces a hormone called insulin which helps glucose from food get into the cells to be used as energy.</p>
      <p>Dr Bonsu said due changes in the lifestyle of Ghanaians, diabetes is increasingly becoming a major cause of disability and death among many Ghanaians both the young and old, with high numbers of diabetes related cases being reported at health facilities across the country.</p>
      <p>Based on this, he said, the time has come to raise awareness of the causes and impact of diabetes on individuals, families and the society as well as highlight the preventive measures and the support networks available for those affected.</p>
      <p>He said it is important for families to know the signs of diabetes in their children or other family members to enable them quickly get medical assistance when the need arises.</p>
      <p>“Some of the signs include frequent urination, feeling very thirsty and very hungry, even though you are eating, extreme fatigue, blurry vision, cuts/bruises that is slow to heal, weight loss—even though you are eating more, for type one diabetes and tingling, pain, or numbness in the hands or feet for type two diabetes.”</p>
      <p>Dr Bonsu said generally, unhealthy life patterns among Ghanaians including lack of exercise, high sugar intake, unhealthy eating habits among others poses a greater risk.</p>
      <p>“Many people who have diabetes are unaware of their condition. Diabetes, if not treated can have diverse effects on the individual: it affects the nerves and the blood vessels, the eye, causes heart diseases, kidney problems, stroke, indirectly causes infertility and impotency among others.”</p>
      <p>He urged families to take keen interest in this condition and report early warning signs to health facilities whiles encouraging prevention among family members.</p>
      <p>He advised families to carefully consider their eating habits, ensure they eat more of whole grains, vegetables, some fruits that are suitable for them, avoid eating too much and late at night, avoid alcohol and smoking, drink a lot of water and exercise regularly.</p>
      <p>As part of the campaign the market women were also taken through free medical screening and provided with free medication.</p>
