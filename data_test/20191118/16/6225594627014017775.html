      </figure>
      <p>All you have to do next is click on the profile of the influencer you are interested in. On their profile, you will see basic information about the influencer, such as:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Portfolio type</b>
        </li>
        <li>

          <b>Gender</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Location</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Introduction</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Featured branded content partners</b>
        </li>
      </ol>

      </figure>
      <p>You will also find two types of insights and statistics showing a creator’s activity:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Creator Insights</b> – Branded content, followers, engagement rate, posts, videos, views per video</li>
        <li><b>Audience Insights</b> – Gender, age, top countries, top languages, top cities, top regions, live events, partners</li>
      </ol>

      </figure>
      <p>If you are interested in several, you can also save their profiles and add them to the Creator List, contact them, or continue searching for similar creators who are similar.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/wersm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wersm-how-to-use-facebook-brand-collabs-manager-as-an-advertiser-or-brand-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C344&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You can also create multiple lists with different names to organize them. For example, you might want to create a list of creators you are already working with, or who you have previously collaborated with in the past. Similarly, you can place those who you have already contacted, and those you’d like to contact in different lists.</p>
      <p>To contact a creator, use the “Contact Creator” button, fill in your e-mail, other recipients, and a customized message. Your message will be sent directly via email, and replies will go to the email address you’ve entered already.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>You can also, however, contact a creator through “Project Briefs,” filling in all the details and profiles that meet your requirements. A brief will be sent to them, and they can contact you if they are interested.</p>
      <p>Again, you select your requirements, such as portfolio, age, gender, and topics,  like in the previous steps. After filling in all the items, publish the brief, and then your offer will be sent to the filtered creators.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>During the collaboration that should ensue, the creator will have to designate a partnership with your business or brand whenever making a relevant post.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/wersm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wersm-how-to-use-facebook-brand-collabs-manager-as-an-advertiser-or-brand-10.jpg?resize=1024%2C257&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The same applies to you when working with a creator. It’s also pretty cool that you can also <a href="https://newsfeed.org/how-to-create-branded-content-ads-on-instagram/">create Branded Content Ads on Instagram</a>, or create Facebook’s Lookalike Audiences based on this branded content. You can also use the Boost Post button to promote posts and reach a wider audience.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Facebook’s Brand Collabs Manager allows you to monitor statistics on how your collaboration with a creator is working, and to measure the performance of two things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Posts and stories made by a creator which labeled you as a sponsor, or</li>
        <li>Posts created by you in which you tagged your partner.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you’re working with multiple creators, the tools let you measure and compare results, see which collaboration was most effective for you, and focus on other strategies accordingly.</p>
      <p>Working with appropriate creators can have significant benefits for your business, and can be a good way to make more sales. But don’t neglect to choose the best for you; be sure to carefully study their stats on <a href="https://wersm.com/category/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://wersm.com/category/other/instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
