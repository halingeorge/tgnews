      <p>Deputy President William Ruto’s daughter, Abby Cherop, is among candidates who managed over 400 marks in this year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations.</p>
      <p>Abby, who sat for her exams at Greenvale School based in Uasin Gishu county, scored 406 marks out of the possible 500.</p>
      <p>Her mother, Prisca Chemutai Bett, couldn’t hide her joy as she congratulated her daughter for being among top achievers in her school and nationally.</p>
      <p>She noted that the DP is yet to send his congratulatory message but she knows he is impressed.</p>
      <p>“I know he has received the news. He is yet to send a congratulatory message but when he gets time I know he will. He has been very supportive and we appreciate his effort,” Chemutai said.</p>
      <p>In February 2017, DP Ruto dismissed claims of neglecting Abby after Chemutai sued him for child support.</p>

      <p>The DP admitted that he was the father of Abby adding that he has been paying Sh40,000 monthly for the girl’s upkeep.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets on his official Twitter handle, the DP revealed that he had gone further and secured the mother of his daughter a job that pays her Ksh90,000 a month.</p>
      <p>“The other father/s should be men enough and look after their kids. Trying blackmail for me to cater for other men’s children won’t work,” he wrote.</p>
