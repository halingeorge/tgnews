      <h1>Liverpool suffer injury setback with duo doubtful for Crystal Palace clash</h1>
      <h2>Latest Liverpool injury news ahead Saturday's game at Selhurst Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:11:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Connor O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool will be left sweating on the fitness of Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson for their game against Crystal Palace this weekend.</p>
      <p>According to the Liverpool Echo, Salah is rated as a doubt by Liverpoolâ€™s medical staff, with the same also applying to Robertson.</p>
      <p>Salah has been troubled by a persistent ankle injury since limping off during the 2-1 win over Leicester in October after a poor challenge from Hamza Choudhury.</p>
      <p>The forward flew out to Egypt for a scan with the Pharaohs' medical department before being placed in a protective boot ahead of a return to Merseyside.</p>
      <p>Robertson suffered a swollen ankle in the 3-1 win over City but was determined report for international duty.</p>
      <p>The former Hull man has been struggling with the issue for a number of weeks, with his training programme carefully managed behind the scenes at Melwood, and like Salah, will continue to be assessed ahead of the game at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>However, Joe Gomez is winning his battle to be fit for the game. Gomez withdrew from the England squad over the weekend ahead of their win over Kosovo on Sunday after suffering a knee injury in training.</p>
