      <h1>Green Agenda Nazi Roots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:47:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://maritimebulletin.net/author/ls9iw/" target="_blank">Mikhail Voytenko</a></address>
      <p>Maersk CEO whatever-his-name left Maersk and went to MSC – sensation in industry media and elite. Shipping will never be the same. Tectonic plates moved. Well, shipping in general, and Maersk/MSC in particular, will hardly notice that bombshell, nothing will change except elites power games and probably, MSC shift to more insane than it already is, “green sustainable” agenda, if Maersk recent actions, statements, declarations and intentions in this respect are of any judgment.<br/>Listen to a lecture, given by a respected British analyst, adviser and author, Rupert Darwall, one lecture among many others, given by prominent professionals in each field of human activities, from science to finance to environmentalism. It’s one more warning, one more in-deep and professional analysis of some of the aspects of the green-leftist-nazi agenda. One such lecture bears much more weight and meaning, than all comrades major CEOs shifts and leaps, taken together.<br/>P.S. For those who still didn’t get it – all shipping major CEOs and companies are entangled in Climate Industrial Complex, are part of the Complex, together with IMO and other international organizations, hence their ruinous policy.</p>
