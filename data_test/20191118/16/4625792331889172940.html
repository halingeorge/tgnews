      <h1>Conservative group cuts ties with Michelle Malkin over support for Holocaust denier</h1>

      <p>A conservative organization has cut ties with right-leaning pundit Michelle Malkin over her support for an alt-right personality who has denied the Holocaust took place.</p>
      <p>Malkin's severance from Young America's Foundation, which has booked her for over 15 years, came as a result of her repeated support for Nick Fuentes.</p>
      <p>“Michelle Malkin is no longer part of YAF’s campus lecture program,” a YAF spokesman told <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/conservative-group-yaf-fires-michelle-malkin-over-support-for-holocaust-denier?ref=scroll">the Daily Beast</a> Sunday.</p>
      <p>Fuentes and his followers, who call themselves "groypers," a nod to the Pepe the Frog meme, have gained notoriety in recent months for videos which traffic in anti-Semitism and racism and for interrupting events hosted by more mainstream conservative groups, such as <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/turning-point-usa-denounced-racism-and-conservative-snowflakes-have-a-problem-with-that">Turning Point USA</a>.</p>
      <p>Conservative pundits <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-alt-right-has-no-future-in-conservatism">Donald Trump Jr.</a>, Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Ben Shapiro have attacked Fuentes and those who support him, noting his participation in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.</p>
      <p>Despite the backlash from many mainstream conservatives, Malkin, who most recently spoke on behalf of YAF last week, has heaped praise upon Fuentes, recently dubbing him "one of the New Right leaders."</p>

      <p>"YAF gives a platform to a broad range of speakers with a range of views within the mainstream of conservative thought," YAF said in a statement explaining the decision. "Immigration is a vital issue that deserves robust debate. But there is no room in mainstream conservatism or at YAF for [H]olocaust deniers, white nationalists, street brawlers, or racists."</p>
      <p>Malkin later took a shot at the group calling them "The Keepers of the Gate" and "not 'mainstream.'" She added, "My defense of unjustly prosecuted Proud Boys, patriotic young nationalists/groypers &amp; demographic truth-tellers must not be tolerated. SPLC is cheering."</p>
