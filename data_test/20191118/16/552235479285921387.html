      <h2>Lothian buses raised the money for Macmillan Cancer Support after two years of fundraising events</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:01:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author">John-Paul Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-paul-clark/</a></address>
      <p>Customers and staff from Lothian buses have raised over £35,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.</p>
      <p>The charity is Lothian’s first official ‘Charity of Choice Partnership,’ chosen exclusively by staff in a ballot.</p>
      <p>Across two years, Lothian has hosted various events to raise awareness and funds for Macmillan Cancer Support such as bake sales and coffee mornings.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The charity were also the main beneficiaries of Lothian’s doors open days, and charity golf days during the partnership. The company also wrapped a bus in the Macmillan tartan which was given the nickname, Hamish.</p>
      <p>The charity was also a welcome visitor to the company’s garages over the last two years, providing support and resources for Lothian employees who have been affected by cancer.</p>
      <p>Laura Foreman, senior fundraising manager, Macmillan Cancer Support: “We cannot thank Lothian and their customers enough for their support over the past two years. They have worked tirelessly to raise an incredible amount of money and awareness of cancer prevalence and our services in Edinburgh and the Lothians. £35,000 could fund a Macmillan Nurse for seven and a half months and support many people in our local area. Thank you Lothian.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Richard Hall, managing director for Lothian said: “Macmillan Cancer Support have been a great Charity Partner to work with over the last two years. Lothian have felt privileged to be able to work with their fantastic team to help raise funds for and create awareness of the vital work that they do to support people affected by cancer across Edinburgh and the Lothians.</p>
      <p>“We are absolutely delighted to have raised over £35,000 through various initiatives which is testament to our staff and customers who have shown such incredible support for the charity throughout our partnership.”</p>
