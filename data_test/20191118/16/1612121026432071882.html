      <p>Samsung’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343786-samsung-galaxy-fold-september-release/">Galaxy Fold has only been available</a> for a couple of months at this point, but that’s not going to hold up the company’s other plans to release a follow-up device. In fact, that successor might come sooner rather than later, since Samsung’s own website has already listed some references to a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/339284-the-first-batch-of-samsungs-2000-galaxy-fold-has-already-sold-out/">Galaxy Fold 2</a> in support pages.</p>
      <p>The references come from Samsung Africa’s website and mention the SM-F700F, which is reportedly codenamed Bloom internally. The original model number for the Galaxy Fold was SM-F900F, so we know this is going to fall in that <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/334631-samsungs-foldable-galaxy-f-smartphone-could-launch-in-march-2019-with-a-1770-price-tag/">same category</a> of folding devices, even if it isn’t necessarily called the Galaxy Fold 2.</p>
      <p>This device is also rumored to launch not long after the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340519-first-galaxy-s11-rumors-start-up-hinting-at-a-major-change-to-samsungs-cameras/">Galaxy S11</a>, assuming we don’t have as many delays as the original Galaxy Fold. That timeline makes sense, since it would’ve released about a year after the original Galaxy Fold if its launch date hadn’t been pushed back a few months. It should make for an interesting start to the year for Samsung.</p>
      <p>Aside from this model number reference, though, we don’t know anything else about the phone. It could be a continuation of what the Galaxy Fold started, or it could be something more in line with the brand new Motorola RAZR with a clamshell folding design instead. Samsung likes to throw a lot of things at the wall to see what sticks, so that wouldn’t surprise me.</p>
