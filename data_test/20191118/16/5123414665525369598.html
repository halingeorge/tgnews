      <p>For those who've been in the house music game for some time, the label Subliminal Records needs no introduction. Helmed by Erick Morillo, the label was responsible for some of the biggest hits in the genre in the '00s. But, a label is only as great as the artists that release on it, and one of its main artists, Harry "Choo Choo" Romero, being a key example. Together, they and the rest of the crew became an unstoppable force in the club world. Fast-forward to today, and Harry is still pushing the boundaries of both himself and of house music. In our chat, we discuss his upbringing in the New Jersey suburbs, growing up during the golden era of house music, and how you must continue to innovate and redefine yourself in order to grow.   </p>
