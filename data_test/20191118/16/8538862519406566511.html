      <p>Can you feel that? Those tremors in the ground? That's the ominous approach of frugal shoppers stampeding to stores for Black Friday. It's coming, everyone, and nothing can stop it. We may as well just ride the storm. Of course, playing its part in the swirling vortex of bargains and elbows in the ribs will be Sony, as it aims to push PlayStation hard this holiday season.</p>
      <p>Over on the <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/11/18/playstation-2019-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the platform holder's Black Friday and Cyber Monday plans have been outlined, and we're already looking at some excellent deals for North America.
