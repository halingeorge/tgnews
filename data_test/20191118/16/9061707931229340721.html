      <h1>'Small margins' - Derby County goalkeeper identifies where Rams need to improve</h1>
      <h2>Latest Derby County news | The Rams have picked up 21 points from their opening 16 Sky Bet Championship matches and are in 16th place in the league table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Derby County goalkeeper Kelle Roos is confident that the Rams can climb the Sky Bet Championship table in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>are currently in 16th place as we approach the end of the November international break, and resume their league campaign against <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/focus-prestons-mindset-going-derby-3549896">Preston North End</a> at Pride Park Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-phillip-cocu-feyenoord-3549224">Phillip Cocu</a>’s side have amassed 21 points from their opening 16 league fixtures, but the contrast between their home and away form is starling.</p>
      <p>At Pride Park, Derby have won four of their eight matches and picked up 15 points from a possible 24.</p>
      <p>However, on the road Derby have struggled. The opening day win away at Huddersfield Town remains Derby’s only victory on their travels in the league – they have accumulated just six points and have lost four matches.</p>
      <p>Roos says that improving on Derby’s away form is key to their ambitions of climbing up the Championship table as the season progresses.</p>
      <p>“It all starts on the training ground,” Roos told <a href="https://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/2019/11/roos-confident-rams-making-steps-in-right-direction-ahead-of-return-to-action">the club’s website</a> .</p>
      <p>“You must work hard every day and then that becomes the mindset.</p>

      <p>“Relationships are built on the training ground so you must work within the unit you play in, press as a team, defend as a team and keep battling. If you do that then it becomes easier on a matchday.</p>
      <p>“At home we have a little run going, but away from home it’s not going how we want it to and I feel like it’s down to small margins.</p>
      <p>“We are not far away from getting a few wins on the road but it’s now about doing the things that can help us pick up results.</p>
      <p>“I think if we can do that then we will climb up the table quickly.”</p>
