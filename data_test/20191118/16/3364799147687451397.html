      <hr/>
      <p>WeWork's bonds have fallen to yet another fresh low as investors grow increasingly worried that the company won't be able to repay its debt. </p>
      <p>The company's $669 million in notes due in 2025 fell to 71 cents each on Monday, sliding more than three cents to the new low, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/wework-bonds-fall-to-new-lows-after-latest-string-of-bad-news">Bloomberg reported, citing Trace data</a>. The yield on the bonds is now more than 16%. </p>
      <p>A string of bad news is eroding investor confidence in the company, already low after <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weworks-nightmare-ipo?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">a failed initial public offering attempt in September</a> cut WeWork's valuation to $8 billion from $47 billion. </p>
      <p>On Monday, WeWork Chairman Marcelo Claure said that layoffs will <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-chairman-tells-employees-layoffs-will-begin-this-week-2019-11?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">begin "in earnest" this week</a>. It's expected that the company could <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-planning-layoffs-restructure-new-york-times-2019-11?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">lay off around 4,000 people</a>, roughly a third of the its total employees. </p>
      <p>The announcement from Claure came after reports Friday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing whether<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-reportedly-draws-scrutiny-from-sec-2019-11?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest"> the company violated any financial rules in the months leading up to its IPO flop</a>. A preliminary inquiry is looking at WeWork's business and its disclosures to stakeholders, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/wework-is-said-to-face-sec-inquiry-into-possible-rule-violations">Bloomberg reported.</a> </p>
      <p>And Thursday, a company earnings presentation showed that WeWork <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weworks-third-quarter-earnings-show-high-growth-strategy-2019-11?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">lost $1.3 billion in the third quarter,</a> versus $500 million in the same quarter a year ago.</p>
