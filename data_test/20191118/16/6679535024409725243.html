      <p>A group of residents living along Crawford Road on Monday petitioned the District Collector requesting alternative residential arrangements following an eviction notice which was sent to them a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>About 200 residents gathered at the District Collectorate on Monday and claimed despite several requests, no alternative arrangements have been made by the district administration. “We have been residing in the locality for nearly 40 years. If we are asked to vacate, they should also tell us where to go. We cannot take our children, things and go stay on the streets, can we?” asked K. Akilandeshwari, a resident.</p>
      <p>The date fixed for the demolition of the buildings is November 19. The residents threatened to stage a protest if their houses were demolished. “Unlike in TVS Tollgate where all the recently evicted buildings were commercial, the entire Crawford Main Road is lined by nearly 200 residences. Where will we all go?” asked a resident.</p>
      <p>The residents claim that if they are given alternative housing, they will not come in the way of the district administration’s plans. “All we want is a roof over our heads. If they give us some place, we will gladly vacate, we do not want to come in the way of developmental projects. But, they are not ready to listen,” Ms. Akilandeshwari said.</p>
