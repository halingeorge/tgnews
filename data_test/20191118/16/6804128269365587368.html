      <h2>Manchester United chief Ed Woodward has promised big-money signings but warned fans January additions are unlikely</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:56:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United chief Ed Woodward has issued a message to the club's top-four rivals, vowing that the club will continue to make big-money signings to challenge the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/manchester-united">United</a> have struggled to find consistency this season, just like Arsenal and Spurs, which has allowed Chelsea to open up a significant gap, while Leicester City currently look to be the other favourites to land Champions League football.</p>
      <p>As a result, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United side face a second season in a row outside of Europe's elite competition but, despite the financial implications of missing out, United will continue to spend.</p>
      <p>Speaking to shareholders on Monday, Woodward insisted United will move look to improve their fortunes by blending 'world class acquisitions' with academy graduates.</p>
      <p>“We know this will not be achieved overnight. However we have made investments across the club that we believe have set us on the right path.</p>
      <p>“We have significantly invested in our recruitment infrastructure… demonstrated by the signing of Maguire, (Daniel) James and Wan-Bissaka, who have all settled in well.</p>
      <p>“We will continue with our strategy to promote the best of the players graduating from our academy together with material investment in the coming summers to strengthen our young squad further and challenge for trophies.”</p>
      <p>He added: "We have a clear vision in terms of football philosophy and recruitment.</p>
      <p>"The significant investments that we have made in recent years in areas such as transfers, recruitment infrastructure, analytics and our Academy are already beginning to bear fruit.</p>
      <p>"We are very proud to be shortly approaching a milestone 4,000th game featuring an Academy player, and we are particularly optimistic regarding the considerable young talent currently coming through.</p>
      <p>"Our ultimate goal is to win trophies by playing exciting football with a team that fuses graduates from our Academy with world-class acquisitions.”</p>
      <p>However, it is widely reported that United will not splash the cash in January unless one of their targets become available for the right price, with Solskjaer's side already linked with the likes of James Maddison, Erling Braut Haaland and Jadon Sancho.</p>
