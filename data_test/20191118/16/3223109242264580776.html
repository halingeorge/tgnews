      <h1>‘Street Fighter V: Champion Edition’ Finishes the Game Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:51:06+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p><i>Street Fighter IV</i> famously revived the franchise, and 2D fighting games in general, on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. With the genre already secure, <i>Street Fighter V</i> had a bit of rockier experience this generation. The fighting fundamentals were as solid as they had ever been. But between initial online woes, limited content, and confusing monetization strategies, the game was an early victim of the “games as a service plague.” It took two years for us to finally get the game we were promised in <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/street-fighter-v-arcade-edition-is-the-game-we-should-have-gotten-2-years-ago-1728482/"><i>Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition.</i></a></p>
      <p>However, even after that first revision, Capcom kept plugging away at its prize fighter, adding a bunch of new characters and costumes and stages. If you already have the game, you can buy that content for yourself piecemeal (or grind out fight money if that’s still a thing?) But next year you can just get everything bundled together in <i>Street Fighter V: Champion Edition</i>.</p>

      <p>This complete collection offers you just about everything you can get from <i>Street Fighter V</i>. 40 characters with new V skills, 34 stages, and over 200 costumes. Only thing missing are weird branded deals.</p>
      <p>One of those characters is brand new for this version. While it had issues, <i>Street Fighter V’s</i> wacky story mode finally brought the convoluted <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/street-fighter-vs-story-mode-turns-street-fighter-into-fast-and-furious-1660676/"><i>Fast and Furious</i>-style continuity</a> full circle with its links back to <i>Street Fighter III</i>. And now Gill, the nude red-and-blue god man final boss of that game, is finally playable in <i>Champion Edition</i>.</p>
