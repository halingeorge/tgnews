      <h2>Man United have had an indifferent start to the season and transfers in the January window looked likely - but Ed Woodward has suggested that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer won't get any additions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:11:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Ed Woodward has suggested that Manchester United won't dip into the transfer market in January.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have endured a mixed opening to the season, which saw them just two points above the drop zone following their worst start in 30 years, before improving in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>They have won five of their last sixth matches in all competitions, including a sparkling 3-1 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> before the international break.</p>
      <p>United are currently seventh in the Premier League, 18 points adrift of table toppers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and nine points shy of the top four.</p>

      <p>Rumours have swirled about plenty of transfers coming into Old Trafford when the window opens in under two months, with the likes of Jadon Sancho, Erling Haaland, Mario Mandzukic and Declan Rice among those mentioned - but that might not be the case.</p>
      <p>Executive vice-chairman Woodward was keen to promote United's academy strength and the young players Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has at his disposal, when speaking to investors on Monday.</p>
      <p>And while he talked about "material investment" to strengthen the squad, he quickly completed the phrase with "in the coming summers".</p>

      <p>"Over the last few years, we have significantly invested in our recruitment infrastructure to augment our already strong and experienced recruitment team, all of whom who are all working to a clear philosophy," Woodward said, as per <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-woodward-call-live-17273763">Manchester Evening News.</a></p>
      <p>"This is demonstrated by the signing of Harry Maguire, Dan James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who have all settled in well.</p>
      <p>"We will continue with our strategy to promote the best of the players graduating from our Academy together with material investment in the coming summers to strengthen our young squad further and challenge for trophies."</p>
      <p>He added: "We have a clear vision in terms of football philosophy and recruitment.</p>
      <p>"The significant investments that we have made in recent years in areas such as transfers, recruitment infrastructure, analytics and our Academy are already beginning to bear fruit.</p>
      <p>"We are very proud to be shortly approaching a milestone 4,000th game featuring an Academy player, and we are particularly optimistic regarding the considerable young talent currently coming through.</p>
      <p>"Our ultimate goal is to win trophies by playing exciting football with a team that fuses graduates from our Academy with world-class acquisitions.‚Äù</p>
