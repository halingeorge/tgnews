      <p>Two men harassed a Jewish man in a kebab shop while he waited for his takeaway - but they picked the wrong person to insult.</p>
      <p>Marlon Solomon, 40, was targeted by two yobs with ‘unfriendly banter’ that quickly turned heated, with the men shouting “are you a f*****g Jew?”</p>
      <p>Mr Solomon - who performs a one-man show about anti-semitism - responded to this with, ‘I am a f*****g Jew’, which sparked a torrent of anti-semitic abuse from the two men.</p>
      <p>He said the men began saying Jewish people should be "wiped out" and denied the Holocaust took place, reports <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/anti-semitic-abuse-northern-quarter-17273117">Manchester Evening News</a> .</p>
      <p>Marlon began to film at Al-Faisal, in the Northern Quarter what was being said on his mobile phone and captured the aftermath of the incident.</p>

      <p>In the clip one man can be heard saying: "You know what it's a load of b*******? It is a lie, the Holocaust."</p>
      <p>"The Jews would be wiped off the face of the earth," a man is heard saying.</p>
      <p>Marlon is heard responding: "There is more decent people in this country that know you are full of s***.</p>
      <p>"This is the best country to live in as a Jew. You are going to try and change that, but you won't because this country is better than that."</p>
      <p>Marlon claims the pair gave a fascist salute as they left the takeaway.</p>

      <p>Greater Manchester Police confirmed they are investigating the incident, which took place at around 10.30pm on Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>Marlon, who performs a one-man show about anti-Semitism, said: "They both went on saying 'Jews are the worst, Jews are the worst of the lot you rule the world'.</p>
      <p>"They were saying they wished 'Jews had been all wiped out'.</p>
      <p>"The interesting bit was they were talking all about Palestine. One of them was ex-Army.</p>
      <p>"They were hypocritical and so racist going on about his grandfather serving in Palestine.</p>
      <p>"My mum pointed out her dad also served in Palestine for the British Army alongside those guys."</p>
      <p>Marlon added: "We have been in Manchester for 120 years, our family.</p>

      <p>"I haven't seen anything like this before. This is the current political climate at the moment, but part of me thinks these people have always been there.</p>
      <p>"My family had to fight in the former Jewish quarter where Strangeways is.</p>
      <p>"It is a really dark time at the moment with people like this."</p>
      <p>A GMP spokeswoman said: "Police were called to Thomas Street, Manchester. It was reported to us as a hate incident.</p>
      <p>"Enquiries are ongoing. There have been no arrests."</p>
