      <p>John appeared on the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> spin-off show alongside <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a>'s Alison Hammond.</p>
      <p>And, while John arrived on the show high kicking and screaming his "fabulous!" catchphrase, there was only one thing on viewers' minds.</p>
