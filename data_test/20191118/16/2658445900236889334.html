      <p>An 84 year old step mother of Ponle Eebo, a popular politician in Osun State, Madam Janet Alatede Ebo, has been stabbed to death by unknown assailants.</p>
      <p>The deceased was said to have been attacked on Sunday around 8pm in her residence at Afunsho Compound, Oke Are, Irée of Iree in Boripe Local Government of Osun State.</p>
      <p>An eye witness, who is a tenant of the deceased and a student of Osun State Polytechnic, Iree, said that he left the old woman in the house alive around 7:30pm to recharge his phone only to come back and meet her lying dead in a pool of blood.</p>
      <p>According to the eye witness, who preferred anonymity, said: “The old woman lived here with us (tenants) who are students of the Osun State Polytechnic, Iree. Most of my colleagues were not around last night as I was the only one with her in the house.</p>

      <p>“At about 7:30pm, I told her I wanted to charge my phone somewhere as there was no electricity and I asked her (the old woman) not to close the door that I will be back soon. On returning I saw the doors of the house locked.</p>
      <p>“I was confused but had to go in through the back door to my own apartment which is upstairs to gain access to the building. On getting upstairs, I wondered why mama did not leave the door open as I requested. I got down to check Mama in her room and luckily, electricity had been restored. On getting to Mama’s room, I discovered she had been stabbed to death.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Police in Osun State said the investigation into the killing has started.</p>
      <p>The Public Relations Officer for Poloce in the state, Folasade Odoro, disclosed that the state Commissioner of Police, Mrs. Abiodun Ige, has visited the scene and directed detectives to commence immediate investigation.</p>
