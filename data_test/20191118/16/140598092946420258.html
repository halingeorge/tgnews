      <h1>Samoa's schools closed and vaccinations made mandatory as measles outbreak escalates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:11:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/sarah-newey/" target="_blank">Sarah Newey</a></address>
      <p>Samoa is scrambling to contain a deadly measles outbreak which has so far killed six people and infected more than 700. </p>
      <p>The Pacific-island nation, home to a population of roughly 200,000 people, declared an emergency over the weekend as the childhood disease has swept across the the country.</p>
      <p>All schools are now closed and children have been barred from attending public gatherings in an attempt to halt the epidemic, while the National University of Samoa told students that exams scheduled for this week have been postponed indefinitely. </p>
      <p>The government has also announced plans to launch a compulsory measles vaccination programme, as low coverage rates have exacerbated the outbreak. </p>
      <p>According to data from<a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/en/"> Unicef and the World Health Organization</a> (WHO), just 40 per cent of children in Samoa received the first dose of the measles vaccine in 2018 - and only 28 per cent gained the second dose. </p>
      <p>The drop off in coverage is in part because Samoa's vaccination programme was briefly suspended last year after two babies died shortly after receiving the jab. Investigations into the deaths later found that the problem was not due to the vaccine itself, but because nurses incorrectly administered it.</p>
      <p>But the impact was dramatic - in 2017 roughly 80 per cent of infants were vaccinated against measles, while the country recorded a decade high in 2013 when some 99 per cent of children had at least one measles jab. </p>
      <p>According to Reuters Samoa's director general of health, Leausa Take Naseri, expects the epidemic to get worse before it improves because of poor immunisation rates. The WHO recommends that 95 per cent of people need to have had a measles jab to prevent outbreaks of the disease. </p>
      <p>“This latest outbreak in Samoa shows us how important it for vaccination programmes to reach children with lifesaving vaccines all over the world,” Robin Nandy, Unicef's chief of immunisation, told <i>The Telegraph. </i></p>
      <p>“We are alarmed that measles cases globally have increased dramatically in 2019 due to a combination of conflict, insecurity, a breakdown or interruption in services and mistrust of vaccinations. </p>
      <p>“Measles anywhere is a threat to children everywhere, which is why we must make the most of the safe and effective measles vaccines we have at our disposal,” Dr Nandy added.</p>
      <p>The outbreak in Samoa comes amid a global resurgence of measles.</p>
      <p>In the first six months of this year, more than 364,000 cases were reported worldwide - <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/measles-cases-europe-already-surpassed-2018-total-amid-global/">compared to just 129,000 in 2018</a>. And in Europe four countries, including the UK, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/four-european-countries-officially-lose-measles-free-status/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/four-european-countries-officially-lose-measles-free-status/">have lost their measles-free status</a>. </p>
      <p>But it is the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country also battling Ebola, that has seen the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/measles-kills-3600-children-drc-third-emergency-vaccine-drive/">largest measles outbreak</a>. More than 3,600 children have so far died from the disease and roughly 184,000 have been infected. </p>
      <p>Experts have attributed the global resurgence to low vaccination coverage rates, which have been caused by a combination of vaccine hesitancy and poor access to basic health care.</p>
      <p>“This follows successive yearly increases since 2016, indicating a concerning and continuing upsurge in the overall measles burden worldwide,” the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/measles-cases-europe-already-surpassed-2018-total-amid-global/">WHO said in a statement</a>. “Outbreaks [are] straining health care systems, and leading to serious illness, disability, and deaths in many parts of the world.”</p>
      <p>In the Western Pacific alone, there has been a 230 per cent increase in measles infections so far this year - with Fiji and Tonga also recording outbreaks. </p>
      <p>It is thought that the disease entered Samoa via a traveler from New Zealand,  which is in the grips of the most serious outbreak in two decades. More than 2,000 people have so far been infected. </p>
      <p>Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's Prime Minister, has said that her country is sending around 3,000 vaccines to Samoa to help them combat the outbreak, as well 12 nurses and medical supplies. </p>
