      <h1>Boots Meal Deal Price Drops to Celebrate Its 20th Anniversary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:30:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>This week, you can pick up a Meal Deal from Boots for just £1.99 to celebrate twenty years of the offer.</p>
      <p>Established in 1999, it's now been two decades since Boots' Meal Deal rolled out in stores and if that makes you feel old, you probably are. The birthday deal will see the price drop to £1.99 but you need to spend £5 in store to take advantage of the offer.</p>
      <p>Usually priced at £3.39 - unless you're in London where everything is more expensive - it's not too bad of an offer if you were going to grab yourself one anyway. The promotion is live now and runs up until Monday, November 25.</p>
      <p>The Meal Deal selection has become pretty extensive over the years, with increasingly healthy options being added to the usual sandwich and crisps combo. The store even has a <a href="https://www.boots.com/wellness-advice/nutrition/healthy-meal-deals">guide</a> on how to make your lunch more healthy, suggesting sushi or a katsu chicken rice bowl for your mains, and egg and spinach, or apple and cheddar for your snack.
