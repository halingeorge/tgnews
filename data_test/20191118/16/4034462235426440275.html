      <h1>2020 Mitsubishi Mirage Arrives With Fresh Styling And Value</h1>
      <h2>Will this facelift be enough to keep sales momentum?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:10:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mitsubishi/mirage-g4">Mitsubishi Mirage G4 sedan</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mitsubishi/mirage">Mirage hatchback</a> are proving to be hot sellers throughout the world, including the US. Last year, a total of 24,316 examples were sold (sedan and hatchback) in America. Both are only basic transportation, but they also have very affordable starting prices: $14,795 for the sedan and $13,795 for the hatch. Today, Mitsubishi has revealed the facelifted 2020 Mirage G4 and Mirage at the 2019 Thailand International Motor Expo.</p>
      <p>The facelift applies the Japanese automaker's new and more dynamic front-end styling along with a number of interior upgrades. Mitsubishi calls the front end look Dynamic Shield styling, which features new multi-bulb LED headlights connected visually with the grille. Fog lamps are located at the bumper corners. Not everyone may be a fan of the styling, but it's certainly bold, perhaps too much for a subcompact car like this.</p>

      <p>The rear end also receives a bit of restyling, specifically with a wider and more stable look, incorporating a more squared-off approach for the bumper corners and L-signature horizontal LED taillights. The exterior updates are completed with new 15-inch alloy wheels with two-tone diamond-cut styling and two new exterior color choices, White Diamond and Sand Yellow.</p>
      <p>The interior has also been upgraded with redesigned front armrests and improved build materials. The power window switch panel, for example, has a carbon pattern. Higher trim levels come with a sporty-look fabric/synthetic leather combination. The seat sides also receive piping and stitching. Perhaps most importantly is the addition of the automaker's new Smartphone Display Audio system. This is a seven-inch touchscreen that offers full smartphone connectivity including Bluetooth and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Connectivity.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, the 2019 Mirage twins are powered by just one engine option: a 1.2-liter inline-three engine with 78 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque. Power is directed to the front wheels through a five-speed manual or a CVT. Mitsubishi has not implied this setup will change.</p>
      <p>Official pricing has not been announced but sales are likely to begin early next year.</p>
