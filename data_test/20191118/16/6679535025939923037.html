      <p>Three transgender women attempted to commit self-immolation at the District Collectorate campus on Monday demanding jobs, they claimed.</p>
      <p>Vinitha, Ajitha and Nithya, all residents of Ariyamangalam wrote to the District Collector requesting job opportunities as they had necessary educational qualifications. However, for over a year there had been no response, they say.</p>
      <p>Vinitha says that the three of them attended a hotel management course after receiving bachelors degrees. But they were not able to get jobs and were being discriminated against as they were transgenders.</p>
      <p>“We felt ashamed and insulted. Following this incident, we wrote to the Collector and the district social welfare officer. However, there has been no response," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms.Vinitha also alleged that they were being harassed by cops. “If given employment opportunities, we will not have to beg on the streets”, said Vinitha. “We also want to lead respectable lives. We request the district administration to help us live peacefully,” she said.</p>
