      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/sommer-ray/">Sommer Ray</a> looks smoking hot in a pair of tight jeans for her latest Instagram photos, which were posted to her account on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Sommer shared a five-slide update, which featured her sporting the form-fitting denim with a skintight gray tank top and a red jacket. The outfit showcased the model’s long, lean legs, tiny waist, curvy hips, and gave fans a peek at her cleavage.</p>
      <p>The social media stunner accessorized her look with a pair of calf-high snakeskin boots and a black belt. She also had a black leather handbag slung over her shoulder, gold hoop earrings, and rocked multiple rings on her fingers.</p>
      <p>Sommer’s long, blond hair was worn in a deep side part and styled in wild waves that fell down her back and cascaded over her shoulder. She also opted for a full face of makeup in the photos, which she reveals were taken during “golden hour.”</p>
      <p>The model wore defined eyebrows, long lashes, and a bold pink eye shadow. She had a bronzed glow on her face and added pink blush to bring out her check bones. She complete the application with some pink gloss on her full lips.</p>
      <p>Sommer appears to be standing on the balcony of a tall building as a gorgeous landscape and setting sun can be seen behind her.</p>
      <p>Of course, Sommer’s more than 23 million followers fell in love with the snaps, which earned the model over 835,000 likes and more than 3,500 comments.</p>

      <p>“I do love the view, but I mostly love to look at you,” one of Sommer’s Instagram followers wrote in the comments section of the post.</p>
      <p>“So glad you never got breast implants. Lol you’re perfect,” another social media user stated.</p>
      <p>“Best part of my day. Getting a notification from Sommer,” a third comment read.</p>
      <p>Loading...</p>
      <p>“Golden hour is whenever the notifications come through that Sommer Ray posted!” a fourth person gushed over the model.</p>
      <p>Although the blond bombshell is mostly covered up in her most recently photos, fans know that she has no qualms about showing some major skin.</p>
      <p>As previously reported by <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5746885/sommer-ray-triple-bikini/">The Inquisitr</a></i>, Sommer recently rocked Instagram with photos of herself sporting a tiny black-and-white spotted thong bikini.</p>
      <p>In the snaps the model showcases her curvy booty as she leaves little to the imagination by wrapping a see-through netted skirt around her waist.</p>
      <p>That update also proved to be wildly popular for Sommer as it has raked in over 1.4 million likes and more than 8,200 comments to date.</p>
