                            <p>The Brazilian star had great years in Barcelona and formed a fierce alliance with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. Later, Neymar wanted to have a separate legacy, as the might of Messi and Suarez overshadowed his talent.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the 27-year-old star opted out his way from Barcelona. Although, Neymar has not levelled up his bar instead his career has taken a slight hit, his injuries have certainly prevented him to reach his previous levels. Thus, the Brazilian reportedly thinks he has better prospects at Barcelona.</p>
