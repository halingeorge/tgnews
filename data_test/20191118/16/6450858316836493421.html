      <h3>What's the best antivirus for Windows?</h3>
      <p>We've gathered everything you need to know about buying virus protection for a Windows PC or laptop, including a list of the best security software available, in this handy guide to the best antivirus for 2019. Many of these products also run on Android, offering extra protection for your phone, too. </p>
      <p>Antivirus software is crucial if you want to protect your computer, as well as the files and data you store on it. Unless you have security software installed, your computer is vulnerable to viruses, malware and ransomware, each of which are becoming smarter and more damaging as technology evolves.</p>
      <p>Our current pick of the best antivirus for PC is <a href="https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/solutions/total-security.html">Bitdefender</a>, and we explain why below. Also topping our chart with five star reviews are <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7928211-13090595?sid=06-3676938-11-0000000">Norton</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3676938-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Fsecurity%2Fbest-antivirus-3676938%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eset.com%2Fuk%2Fhome%2Ffor-windows%2F">ESET</a>. All products have been extensively tested, so you know exactly which security software you can trust.</p>
      <h3>Should I buy antivirus software now or wait for Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year, and in 2019 takes place on <b>29 November</b>. We're already seeing some great consumer tech deals and expect them to continue right into January, with <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday deals</a> followed by <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/gadget/best-cyber-monday-deals-3667890/">Cyber Monday deals</a>, Christmas deals, Boxing day deals and then we've got the January sales.</p>
      <p>That's both good and bad, of course, because how do you know that a product won't drop in price the very next week? The truth is you can never be entirely sure, but we're now close enough to the main event that many retailers have already begun their Black Friday sales. Of the big UK retailers, Currys has started its <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3676938-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsearch-keywords%2Fxx_xx_xx_xx_xx%2F-why_wait-%2Fxx-criteria.html">Why Wait? sale</a>, guaranteeing that products won't drop any further in price for Black Friday, while <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Friday-Deals/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;node=161428031&amp;ascsubtag=06-3676938-11-0000000">Amazon</a> has a range of Black Friday Countdown deals, with its main event starting on 22 November. </p>
      <p>They aren't the only ones, and we've been busy hunting down the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/internet/antivirus-deals-3667690/">best antivirus deals</a> so that you don't have to. While prices may go down further for Black Friday, some discounts will also end sooner, so unless you're sure that a product will be discounted it's always best to take a deal at face value: if you think the product is worth that amount of money, go for it. Sometimes it doesn't pay to hold out for something that will never happen.</p>
      <p>Below we've provided some buying advice on what to look for in antivirus: even if the products we round up here are not discounted, you may find similar products at much lower prices - and if our #2 or #3 ranked product is discounted, that be enough for you to consider it over the #1 software.</p>

            <p>With a raft of features, it offers great value for money, and we're pleased to see that those features are all included in the price rather than available as free trials after which you'll need to cough up more cash.</p>
            <p>The Syninspecter tool, for example, shows you a complete yet manageable rundown of your entire system's security status. There's also a social media scanner, anti-theft tools, a Home Network Protection tool, banking and payment protection and lots more.</p>

                  <p>It's priced at £69.96/$99.95 for 10 devices, but you'll find it heavily discounted most of the time with prices starting <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8807234-11167155?sid=06-3676938-11-3668830">at £20.98/$29.98 for a year here</a>. </p>
                  <p>An identity protection feature searches the web for leaked details, while a parental control module helps you keep an eye on your children's use of mobile devices. There's a game booster to block popups and optimise CPU performance, as well as a PC tune up facility that will be useful to non-gamers.</p>
                  <p>The interface is a bit on the technical side, with lots of scan types, options and settings, and there's no dedicated anti-ransomware module which is a shame.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, it scored below industry average for protection in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3676938-11-3668830&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Fsecurity%2Fbest-antivirus-3676938%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.av-test.org%2Fen%2Fantivirus%2Fhome-windows%2F">AV-Test's latest test</a>, but did fare better for performance and usability.</p>

                        <p>You will, however, get a firewall, several scan types and a very welcome ransomware shield, as well as a file shredder and web protection tools.

                          <h3>Your buying guide to the best antivirus software</h3>
                          <p>Internet security software, or Antivirus software, detects, and then prevents, disarms or removes malicious programmes or malware, often referred to as viruses. Antivirus doesn't offer a perfect solution to the problem of malware, but it's a critical first step to securing your machine. It's also important to keep that software updated.</p>
                          <p>But internet security software is no longer just about countering viruses. Although they still exist, viruses are arguably a minor part of the malware now prevalent on the web.</p>
                          <p>More important now is security of personal data and protection from ransomware. Security exploits aren't about show-off hackers massaging their egos, anymore, but about monetising their malware.</p>
                          <p>The modern day criminal doesn't have to be a hard-line hacker, either. They can buy all the software they need, and millions of addresses, on the dark web or even on eBay, if they know where to look.</p>
                          <h4>Zero day attacks</h4>
                          <p>Malware is evolving faster than ever, but fortunately the latest generation of antivirus is better equipped than ever to handle new threats.</p>
                          <p>Although the primary concern is to block malware so it doesn't install on your PC in the first place, there isn't an internet security suite made which is 100% effective.</p>
                          <p>That said, worthwhile internet security and antivirus software should also detect so-called 'zero day' attacks, where the malware is so new it hasn't yet been analysed or had 'signatures' build into internet security protection routines.</p>
                          <p>The speed with which these analyses are made is an important factor in the level of protection an internet security suite can provide. Some companies now claim a turnaround of well under an hour, using information gained from their own customers about similar attacks.</p>
                          <p>The cloud element in security applications is growing more and more important in speeding up this process. Some products are now using behaviour analysis and even artificial intelligence to make things quicker and more reliable.</p>
                          <p>Newly-installed software can be monitored, looking for suspicious activity and can be prevented from potentially damaging actions, such as changing registry entries or installing any browser add-ons. Ransomware can also be identified by unexpected attempts to encrypt your files.</p>
                          <p>Plus, with our <a href="http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/security/best-computer-security-tips-3679097/">extra tips on securing your computer</a>, your stuff should remain safe.</p>
                          <h4>How we test antivirus software</h4>
                          <p>Every program on this list is worth your investment. The differences between the top few are relatively minor. The critical thing is to install one of them.</p>
                          <p>We test them by teaming up with the UK's <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3676938-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Fsecurity%2Fbest-antivirus-3676938%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fselabs.uk%2F">SELabs</a>, as well as Germany's <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3676938-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Fsecurity%2Fbest-antivirus-3676938%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.av-test.org%2Fen%2F">AV-Test.org</a>, both highly respected independent security-software testing labs. Each rigorously tests antivirus products from a number of leading security companies.</p>
                          <p>The multifaceted testing procedure looks not only at how well an antivirus product can detect malware using traditional, largely signature-based methods (that is, employing a database of known malware types), but also how well it can block brand-new, unknown malware caught fresh from the wild. These companies also examine how well security products clean up after an infection if a piece of malware does get through.</p>
                          <p>Our tests focus on paid-for antivirus products, but there are some <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/software/best-free-antivirus-3649231/">free options available</a>. Paid-for antivirus usually offers better technical support and more comprehensive protection features than free programmes, but free is free and some free packages can still give paid packages a run for their money. Internet security suites go further still, offering <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/security/best-firewall-2018-3677140/">firewalls</a>, parental controls, identity theft protection and more.</p>
