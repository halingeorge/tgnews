      <h1>Jio may buy RCom assets ‘at discount’ as Airtel backs out</h1>
      <h2>Valuation will differ from that of the 2017 deal, as bids this time are under IBC, says Jio executive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:57:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Piyush-Pandey-367/" target="_blank">Piyush Pandey</a></address>
      <p>Reliance Jio is likely to buy out bankrupt telco Reliance Communications (RCom), under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, with Bharti Airtel withdrawing its bids.</p>
      <p>This time, Mukesh Ambani’s offer to buy RCom will be at a steep discount compared to the ₹25,000-crore deal between the Ambani brothers announced in December 2017, sources in the know of the development told <i>The Hindu<b>.</b></i></p>
      <p>A senior Reliance Jio exeutive said, “Earlier, the deal was for buying certain assets of RCom like spectrum, towers, fiber assets and allied infrastructure. But this time, the bids are for RCom under the IBC process, so the valuations will change.”</p>
      <p>On request by Reliance Jio, RCom’s Committee of Creditors (CoC) has extended the deadline and has now decided to open the bid on November 25.</p>
      <p>A consortium of Bharti Airtel, its towers arm Bharti Infratel, and private equity firm Varde Partners, which had submitted bid to buy spectrum and tower assets, has sought to withdraw it.</p>
      <p>“We hereby formally withdraw our resolution plans while reserving all rights, including the right to submit our resolution plan afresh within the new deadline communicated now,” said Harjeet Kohli, authorised signatory for Bharti Airtel, in a letter to resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty.</p>
      <p>Investment advisor S.P. Tulsian said, “Mukesh Ambani will be the biggest beneficiary as he will pick up RCom assets at steep discount compared to what he promised to pay his brother Anil, two years ago. Bharti Airtel’s cash flow won’t permit it to bid given that it has huge liability due to Supreme Court’s order.”</p>
      <p>Bharti Airtel shares rose 4% to close at ₹401.95 in a weak Mumbai market on Monday, after the company withdrew its bids, while RCom shares fell 3.4% to 57 paisa on Monday after its chairman Anil Ambani resigned on Friday. A Bharti Airtel spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
      <p>“Bharti Airtel’s balance sheet is already stretched and they may not want another hole on their balance sheet by acquiring RCom. Reliance Jio is the only profitable telco left and may end up buying RCom,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive V-P, IIFL Securities<b><i>.</i></b></p>
