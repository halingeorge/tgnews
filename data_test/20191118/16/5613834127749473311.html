      <h1>[Chicago] ‘Gags the Clown’ Screening at Days of the Dead This Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:57:12+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>Before arriving on Blu-ray and DVD next month, Bloody Disgusting and Doppelganger Releasing’s <b><i>Gags the Clown</i></b> will be screening this Friday as part of <a href="https://www.daysofthedead.com/chicago/">this weekend’s <b>Days of the Dead</b></a> horror convention, which now takes place at the Crowne Plaza Chicago Ohare Hotel &amp; Conf Ctr in Rosemont, IL. <i>Gags</i> will be showing at 9PM as part of the <b>Reels of the Dead Film Festival</b> from Nov. 22-24th (full schedule below), including as part of the horror convention.</p>
      <p>The horror-comedy takes place eight days since the clown first showed up in Green Bay, WI. Now, over the course of one night, four different groups of people cross paths with the clown everyone calls “Gags” and his true intentions are finally revealed.</p>
      <p>Our very own Patrick Bromley <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3507422/cinepocalypse-review-found-footage-gags-carried-dark-humor/">reviewed the film</a> out of last year’s World Premiere at the Cinepocalypse Film Festival, celebrating “the streak of incredibly dark humor that runs through it,” while also promising quite the payoff.</p>
      <p>The feature film debut for director <b>Adam Krause</b> was inspired by the viral media frenzy and worldwide phenomenon of ‘clown roaming’ sparked by his sixteen-minute short film “Gags” in 2016.</p>
