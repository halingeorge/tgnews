      <p>Former Blues midfielder John Obi Mikel was speaking to <i>beIN SPORTS</i> in Turkey when he maintained that the Belgian superstar was one of the laziest teammates he has ever trained alongside.</p>
      <p>"Hazard has amazing natural talent, maybe not as much as Messi but he can do what he wants when the ball is at his feet," Mikel said, as reported by <i>Fox Sport Asia. </i></p>

      <p>"He didn't like to train hard. While we were working, he was waiting for us to finish training just standing there.</p>
      <p>"But on Sundays he was always the Man of the Match, it was unbelievable."</p>
      <p>Mike spent five years alongside the Belgium international at Stamford Bridge between 2012 and 2017, before leaving the club to join Tianjin TEDA in China.</p>
