      <p>Set in an alternate history where “superheroes” are treated as outlaws, <b>Watchmen</b> embraces the nostalgia of the original groundbreaking graphic novel while attempting to break new ground of its own. Originally published as a 12-issue miniseries beginning in 1986, <b>Watchmen </b>quickly become one of sequential art’s most acclaimed stories. The original story centers on a murder-mystery before unfolding into a planet-altering conspiracy that ultimately asks where the fine line is drawn between heroes and villains.</p>
      <p>Lindelof serves as creator, writer, showrunner, and executive producer on the <b>Watchmen </b>series, with Tom Spezialy, Stephen Williams, and Joseph Iberti also executive producing. In addition to directing the pilot, Nicole Kassell will executive produce. The series comes from Lindelof’s White Rabbit in association with Warner Bros. Television and is based on the DC Comics characters.</p>
      <p>The next episode of <b>Watchmen </b>airs November 24. How do you think Angela will find her way out of this nightmare? Let us know your guess in the comments section below.</p>
