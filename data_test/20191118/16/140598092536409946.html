      <h1>What time is the ITV general election debate tomorrow and who's taking part?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/hannah-daly/" target="_blank">Hannah Daly</a></address>
      <p>With the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/general-election-2019-uk-date/">December general election</a> fast approaching, candidates have started promoting their campaigns, plans and pledges to constituencies across the country. And tomorrow, the first party leaders' debate will take place on ITV.</p>
      <p>From head-to-head battles to multi-party events, here is everything you need to know about the general election TV coverage. </p>
      <h3>When are the general election debates and what TV channel are they on?</h3>
      <p>The first debate on Nov 19 will take place on ITV, while Sky News is proposing Nov 28 for their debate.</p>
      <p>The BBC confirmed that they will also be holding two debates of their own on Nov 29 and Dec 6, in addition to a series of Question Time specials. </p>
      <h3>What time do the general election TV debates start?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Johnson v Corbyn: The ITV Debate, Tuesday Nov 19 - 8pm (ITV).</li>
        <li>Sky News general election debate, Thursday Nov 28, TBC (Sky News).</li>
        <li>The BBC Election Debate, Friday Nov 29, TBC (BBC).</li>
        <li>The BBC Prime Ministerial Debate, Friday Nov 6, TBC (BBC).</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Who will take part in the ITV general election debate?</h3>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will go head-to-head in the first televised debate tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/01/boris-johnson-will-take-jeremy-corbyn-first-head-to-head-election/">Johnson v Corbyn</a> debate, hosted by news presenter Julie Etchingham, will mark the first time since 2015 that both the Labour and Conservative party leaders have taken part in a TV debate. </p>
      <p>Following the announcement from ITV, Mr Corbyn said on Twitter: "This is a once in a generation election. So it's welcome that Boris Johnson has accepted our challenge of a head-to-head TV debate.</p>
      <p>"The choice could not be clearer: Boris Johnson's Conservatives protecting the privileged few or a Labour government on the side of the many."</p>
      <h3>Who will take part in the Sky News general election debate?</h3>
      <p>Sky News has invited the Liberal Democrats, Conservative and Labour party leaders to attend their live TV debate proposed for Nov 28. </p>
      <p>So far only Liberal Democrat head Jo Swinson has accepted the broadcaster's invitation, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/04/jo-swinson-threatens-legal-action-itvs-refusal-grant-place-leaders/">after challenging her exclusion from the ITV debate</a>.</p>
      <p>Sky News originally proposed a live TV debate between the leaders of the current government and the opposition, but now believes "it is sensible to suggest an alternative approach that will allow the public to properly scrutinise a wider range of views". </p>
      <h3>Who will take part in the BBC debates?</h3>
      <p>The BBC has unveiled plans to hold <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/08/bbc-unveils-plans-hold-10-election-debates-three-weeks/">10 special election programmes in the space of three weeks</a>, including a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the major political parties on Nov 29, live from Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn will then take part in the BBC Prime Ministerial Debate in Southampton on Dec 6. BBC Radio 4's Today presenter Nick Robinson will be chairing this head-to-head debate, as well as the seven-way podium event.</p>
      <p>Prior to these two events,  the first episode of a series of Question Time specials will be shown on BBC One. The election special, set to take place on Friday Nov 22, in Cardiff, will see leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, SNP and Liberal Democrat parties each answer questions from the audience for 30 minutes. </p>
      <p>Nigel Farage, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/07/brexiteers-will-never-forgive-tories-brexit-party-failure-unite/">leader of the Brexit Party</a>, and one of the Green Party's co-leaders, either Sian Berry or Jonathan Bartley, will also be able to take questions in two further Question Time specials. </p>
      <p>Emma Barnett will host the final special edition of Question Time on Monday Dec 9, where an audience of under-30s will question senior figures from each of the main parties. </p>
      <h3>Will any more general election TV debates be announced?</h3>
      <p>So far, only ITV, Sky News and the BBC have announced their plans to hold general election TV debates.  </p>
      <p>In addition to the main coverage, BBC Wales will be holding two live debates on Tuesday Nov 26 and Tuesday Dec 3.</p>
      <p>BBC Scotland is set to broadcast its Scotland Leaders debate live from Glasgow on Tuesday Dec 10 and on the same night at 10.45pm, Northern Ireland party leaders will be debating in front of a studio audience. </p>
      <p>ITV has also said they will announce details of further election coverage, including a multi-party debate, in due course. </p>
