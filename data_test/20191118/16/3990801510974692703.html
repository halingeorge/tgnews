      <h1>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield are fantastic — but here’s how they could be better</h1>
      <h2>I love you, but I could love you more</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:18:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author">Callum Booth</a></address>
      <p>On Friday evening, I finally started playing the long awaited <i>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield</i>. These is the first ‘proper’ <i>Pokémon </i>game for the Nintendo Switch (<a href="https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2018/08/24/pokemon-game-pikachu-eevee-lets-go/">the <i>Let’s Go… </i>games don’t count</a>) and, after putting some hours in, I can say one thing: it’s great.</p>
      <p><i>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield </i>feels bigger, more interactive, and exciting than previous titles and — nostalgia aside — I think it can quite easily claim to be the best ever <i>Pokémon </i>game.</p>
      <p>But, if I’m being completely honest, I’m slightly disappointed. The <i>Pokémon </i>series can be so much more.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Before we go on, some disclaimers. Firstly, <i>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield </i>are a fantastic pair of games. Just because I think they can be improved doesn’t mean I’m not having a great time playing them. Secondly, I also get that the series is aimed at the children’s market, so therefore has to adhere to certain requirements, such as complexity and ease-of-use. This isn’t something I’m going to be considering in the below.</p>
      <p>So, with that in mind, here are some surefire ways to improve the <i>Pokémon </i>series<i>.</i></p>

      <h3>Take inspiration from ‘Breath of the Wild’</h3>
      <p>This, in my mind, is the single biggest thing <i>Pokémon </i>should do. While playing <i>Sword &amp; Shield, </i>all I could think about would be how fantastic the game would be if it tried to follow in the footsteps of the latest <i>Zelda</i> game.</p>
      <p>In my mind, it’s about two main things: openness and depth.</p>
      <p>Imagine a <i>Pokémon </i>set in a sandbox-style world. Where the whole map is open to explore at your will. Where you can discover hidden areas and truly dive into a magical world. God, it’d be great.</p>
      <p>Then if Nintendo could bring the depth of <i>Breath of the Wild </i>to <i>Pokémon. </i>Think of being able to use pokémon‘s abilities like you can use magnets or bombs in <i>Breath of the Wild. </i>Mmm.</p>

        <figcaption>The idea of doing this sort of thing in a Pokémon game is making me salivate</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Of course, the company has made strides in this direction (the “wild area” is a large open space you can wander around and catch pokémon, and the introduction of a cooking system broadens its scope), but it feels there’s so much more ground to cover.</p>
      <h3>Reduce the number of pokémon</h3>
      <p>This is probably nostalgia talking, but while I’ve been playing <i>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield</i>, it seems that many of creatures are just mixed-up or rebranded versions of classic creatures. For example, instead of having a pigeon-influenced flying creature, you have a rook-based one instead. It’s fine, but it doesn’t feel <i>unique.</i></p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Love you so much cool squirtle.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now, if the <i>Pokémon </i>series shifted into a more open world, it’d make sense to narrow the amount of the creatures, so each of them have a more prominent role to fulfil. So strip the number of the creatures back. You don’t have to only use the original pokémon, but a mix of these and later generation fan favorites would make the game so much more impactful.</p>
      <p>And yeah, this would probably take something away from the “catch ’em all,” collection element of the game, but I’m willing to give that up for more overall versatility.</p>
      <h3>Adopt more of a story</h3>
      <p>So far, <i>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield </i>has the same basic plot as every game in the series: earn badges by defeating gym owners, and battle against your rival, with the goal of eventually becoming the champion.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a bad thing, but I feel there’s more you can do with the <i>Pokémon </i>world. There are big questions about the nature of the pokémon/human relationship, how evil fits in this universe, mortality, and so much more.</p>
      <p>Hell, even if you don’t want to make the game <i>Witcher 3-</i>dark (which Nintendo definitely wouldn’t do, but we can dream), I feel there’s potential to do something, well, different. And deeper. And more meaningful.</p>
      <h3>Make the battle set-up more intricate</h3>
      <p>The current turn-based battle set-up feels strange. I can understand why technical limitations of the Game Boy led to this fighting methodology in the original games, but today? You can do so much more.</p>

      <p>Whether it’s getting multiple pokémon involved, going completely live-action, or finding a totally different of conducting battles, I feel there’s a huge opportunity here. The very core of <i>Pokémon </i>games has remained virtually the same in over 20 years, and I’d like to see Nintendo take a gamble with combat.</p>
      <h3>Don’t get it mixed up though, ‘Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield’ is still very good</h3>
      <p>Like I said, it’s an incredibly fun game that I’ve already sunk a fair few hours into — and one I expect to keep playing. But it feels very much like a solid update from previous versions, not a generative upgrade.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a bad thing per se, because if you’ve liked previous <i>Pokémon </i>games, you’re bound to like this. But I <i>know</i> this franchise could be so much more. Seeing what Nintendo did with the <i>Zelda</i> series on the Switch has made me hungry to see what they could do with their other franchises.</p>
      <p>Maybe this is greedy, but can you seriously say you wouldn’t like to play a game like the above? Me too. Well, until then, I’ll keep on having a great time playing <i>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield.</i></p>
