      <h3>Are you interested in playing with a Fender Swinger?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Fender Japan is often the source of unusual and unexpected models from the company – and this comeback for the short-lived 50 year-old Swinger model from 1969 is a case in point. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swinger went by other names in its brief past life, including the Fender Musiclander and Fender Arrow, and was a misfire in the company's CBS era, not helped by its recycled beginnings.</p>
      <p>CBS had the idea of combining unused guitar bodies from the <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/bass/cool-and-classic-basses-fender-bass-v-554180">Fender Bass V</a> model with parts from the Fender Musicmaster and the Maverick aka Fender Custom.</p>
      <p>The short-scale model was aimed at the 'student guitar' market but was barely pushed by the company and sunk into the mists of cult appeal… until now!</p>

      <p>It's new and improved too with two single coil <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/best-electric-guitar-pickups">pickups</a> instead of the original one with master volume and tone controls now, along with a three-way switch. </p>
      <p>The hardtail bridge remains a three-saddle configuration as before, along with a 22-fret shortscale neck.</p>
      <p>Five colours will be available: Black, Burgundy Mist Metallic, Dakota Red, Olympic White and Sonic Blue. But the bad news for Swinger fans is it'll only be available in Japan at YEN 103500 around $1000. </p>
