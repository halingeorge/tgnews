      <p>One in four of us will suffer back pain, but for those who suffer from persistent pain, a new service in Torquay aims to help by providing a fast and accurate diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Mount Stuart Hospital has a network of highly-qualified consultants and physiotherapists allowing patients to easily access the treatment and support they need.</p>
      <p>Patients can move up and down a treatment chain at the private hospital, which includes physiotherapy, diagnostics, pain management and surgery, if appropriate.</p>
      <p>"At Mount Stuart Hospital you will be kept informed about every stage of your treatment journey," said Jeanette Mercer, hospital director.</p>
