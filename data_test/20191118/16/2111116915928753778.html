      <p>Some <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday deals</a> are worth waiting until the 'official' deals date of November 29 for, others are worth jumping on as soon as possible. Oppo has just unveiled a sale that definitely belongs in the latter category, slashing the prices of some of the best phones released in 2019 to levels that are unlikely to be beaten on Black Friday itself.</p>
      <p>Oppo is one of the big phone stories of 2019. Although it technically started selling phones in the west before 2019, it was during this year that it released the Oppo Reno series of smartphones, impressive mid-range devices characterised by the iconic pop-up 'shark fin' that houses the front-facing camera.</p>
      <p>With the following deals we've linked to Amazon, where Oppo is running the Black Friday deal, but if you prefer the discounts are also available over at Carphone Warehouse.</p>

      <p>Of particular note there's the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-review">Oppo Reno 10x Zoom</a>, which currently sits in our list of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-phone">best smartphones</a> you can buy right now, with its impressive specs complemented by some of the best camera capabilities you can find in a phone at the moment.</p>
      <p>Then there's the Oppo Reno Z, an affordable phone that takes some of the principles from the other Reno devices but packs them into a more budget package, and like the 10x Zoom, it's heavily discounted.</p>

      <p>As well as those two impressive smartphones, Oppo has also cut the price on the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/oppo-reno-review">Oppo Reno</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/oppo-r17-pro">RX17 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/oppo-rx17-neo">RX17 Neo</a>, some more mid-range devices that are still great, but maybe not quite as good as the Reno 10x Zoom and Reno Z.</p>
      <p>The latter two of those three smartphones try to find the perfect blend of 'stock Android phone' and a pinch of Oppo's DNA, and the first is very similar to the Reno 10x Zoom, just with specs that are a small downgrade.</p>
