      <p>Statistics show that on the global scale, one person dies on the road every 23 seconds and millions more are non-fatally injured.</p>
      <p>Approximately 1.3 million people die each year on the world’s roads, and between 20 and 50 million sustain non-fatal injuries, according to the World Health Organization’s <a href="https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2018/en/">2018 Global Status Report on Road Safety</a>.</p>
      <p>There seem to be less progress in reducing the number of deaths from road traffic incidents in any low-income country between 2013 and 2016.</p>
      <p>Road traffic deaths are now the eighth-leading cause of death for all age groups – killing more people than tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS – and the leading cause of death for children and young adults between the ages of 5 and 29.</p>
      <p>In this piece, Face2Face Africa takes a look at five African countries where traffic-related deaths are high and the causes.</p>
