      <h2>Grey among the six entries for this Saturday's Grade One Chase on Merseyside and trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies believes he can land third win in the race</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:40:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/chris-wright/" target="_blank">Chris Wright</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Twiston-Davies believes Bristol De Mai "should win" a third straight Betfair Chase at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/haydock-racecourse">Haydock Park</a> this Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Naunton handler reported the Simon Munir and Isaac Souede-owned eight-year-old to be on course for his hat-trick bid in the Grade One feature on Merseyside where he will face a maximum of just five rivals.</p>
      <p>The grey worked at Twiston-Davies' Grange Hill Farm stables earlier today and will bid for a third straight victory in the Betfair Chase on his seasonal reappearance this weekend - and try to move to within one victory behind Kauto Star's record of four triumphs in the Haydock feature.</p>
      <p>Having won a second Betfair last year under regular rider Daryl Jacob, Bristol De Mai went on to finish third to Al Boum Photo in the Magners Cheltenham Gold at the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheltenham-festival">Cheltenham Festival</a> in March.</p>
      <p>Although he disappointed the following month when only fourth behind Kemboy in a Grade One Betway Bowl at the Randox Health <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/grand-national">Grand National</a> meeting at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree-racecourse">Aintree Racecourse</a> on his final start last term, he is said to be ready to make his return.</p>

      <p>Speaking at a media event at his Grange Hill Farm yard in Gloucestershire, Twiston-Davies said: "Bristol De Mai is as well as he has always been. There have been no issues or setbacks ahead of the Betfair Chase.</p>
      <p>"I think he proved at Cheltenham that he is the third best horse in England and Ireland. The two Irish horses that finished in front of him are not coming over on Saturday, so he should win it.</p>
      <p>"I don't think it is especially anything to do with Haydock that he has won the Betfair Chase twice before. His run at Cheltenham shows he is a good horse wherever he runs. It was good ground when he won last year and I don't think ground conditions are a problem for him.</p>
      <p>"There is obviously more pressure when you think you have the best horse in the race, rather than being the underdog."Everything has gone well with his preparation, and he seems to be as forward as ever for his seasonal return.</p>
      <p>"They have all got him to beat. It was a good run in the Gold Cup, and it looked like he was going to win at the bottom of the hill.</p>
      <p>"We just don't know (this weekend), because there (are) talking horses in there, so we can't say if it is better or stronger than before."</p>

      <p>Bristol De Mai is a best-priced 11-8 favourite with Sportingbet to win again.</p>
      <p>His chief rival is Lostinstranslation - who is 15-8 with the sponsors, Paddy Power and bet365 - and will bid to give trainer Colin Tizzard a fourth victory in the race.</p>
      <p>He made winning return at Carlisle but is coming out of novice company. And Twiston-Davies feels that he still has plenty to prove.</p>
      <p>The dual Grand National-winning trainer added: "Talk is easy, but he has got to prove it.</p>
      <p>"That was two and a half miles around Carlisle, and we have the horse (Count Meribel) that was second to him, beaten two and a quarter lengths.</p>
      <p>"We hope that Bristol would be better than him."</p>
      <p>If all goes well for Bristol De Mai Twiston-Davies could try to make it third time lucky in the Ladbrokes King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day with his stable star.</p>
      <p>He said: "Assuming it all goes well, it will be exactly the same as last season.</p>
      <p>"If he wins this nicely, you have got to think about the King George and the £1million (bonus). Without the £1million, you probably wouldn't go."</p>
      <p>Bristol De Mai will be joined at Haydock by stablemate Ballyoptic, who won the Grade Two Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby on his seasonal return last month.</p>
      <p>He was among the six entries, which also included two-mile champion Altior, who could still line-up at Haydock - although he is more likely to head to Ascot for the Christy 1965 Chase on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Twiston-Davies said of Ballyoptic: "There are very few races he can go for. He will cope with the soft ground, so why not go for the place money?</p>
      <p>"Anything could happen, and something could fall over, but you wouldn't think he could beat Bristol De Mai.</p>
      <p>"Ballyoptic will probably go there and then go for the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham - which always cuts up a bit. "</p>
      <p>Paul Nicholls' Ryanair Chase winner Frodon and another from the Tizzard stable - last year's Welsh Grand National hero Elegant Escape - complete the six entries for the Betfair Chase.</p>

      <p>Clerk of course Kirkland Tellwright expects ground conditions to be “no slower than soft” for Saturday's Betfair Chase at Haydock.</p>
      <p>The going at Haydock is currently good to soft, soft in places on the hurdle course and soft on the chase course.</p>
      <p>There was one millimetre of rain on Sunday and the forecast is to be dry for today and tomorrow, with showers expected from Wednesday to Friday, while Saturday is predicted to be dry.</p>
      <p>Tellwright said: “The chase course will be no slower than soft, and it might have good to soft in places. The hurdles course looks like it will have good to soft in it.</p>
      <p>“I think we will probably get about six millimetres of rain between now and racing - the forecast is much more cheerful than was the case on Friday.</p>
      <p>“The ground is soft at the moment, and the forecast is looking fairly settled for the next couple of days.</p>
      <p>“From Thursday onwards, there is a chance of a few showers and rain - but at the moment things are looking good, and there is a chance we could have some good to soft ground tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“It looks exciting, and I’m very much looking forward to it.”</p>
      <p>Bristol De Mai beat Cheltenham Gold Cup hero Native River, his stablemate Thistlecrack, the subsequent King George winner Clan Des Obeaux and a former King George winner in Might Bite in the race 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>After the race there was criticism of the fences by some.</p>
      <p>Nicky Henderson said following Might Bite’s defeat: “They have built us some big fences here today, and he nudged one early on - it’s not the first one of mine that has been caught out today (River Wylde fell earlier on the card)."</p>

      <p>But the fences at the Merseyside venue have since been switched back to a previous design.</p>
      <p>Tellwright added: “We used to deal with leaf birch until a few years ago, then we went black birch and now we have gone back to leaf again - because last year it was argued the fences were too stiff.</p>
      <p>“If you had the fences too small or soft the jockeys would fire the horses round and you wouldn’t get a rhythmical event appropriate for a Grade One. No one wants to cause a risk of injury, but there should be a premium for jumping well.</p>
      <p>“Pretty much by the end of the season, we changed our mind to go back to leaf birch because we had to place an order with the supplier. For all that were pretty vigorously against the fences, some quarters defended them, so there was no single view.”</p>
      <p>The Betfair Chase, due off at 3pm, is the feature of a superb seven-race card as the track’s National Hunt season starts with a bang.</p>
      <p>As well the main race, the card features the Grade Three Betfair Best Odds On ITV Races Stayers’ Handicap Hurdle.</p>
      <p>There were 22 entries with Twiston-Davies' Echiquieramong them</p>
      <p>The five-year-old, like Bristol De Mai, is owned by Munir and Souede and won on his British debut at Hexham in October before coming home fifth to weekend Cheltenham winner Thyme Hill in the Grade Two Persian War Novices' Hurdle later the same month.</p>
      <p>Twiston-Davies said: "At Haydock on Saturday, we also probably have Echiquier in the Betfair Best Odds On ITV Races Stayers' Handicap Hurdle.</p>
      <p>"He has had a rest since his last run and will like soft ground. He could be exciting."</p>
      <p>The first race, the Listed Read Paul Nicholls Exclusively At Betfair Newton Novices’ Hurdle, is due off at 12.05pm with the finale, the Better Value On The Betfair Exchange Handicap Chase, set for 3.40pm.</p>
      <p>Gates open at 10.05am. Admission in the Be Friendly Enclosure is £10 with the Grandstand &amp; Paddock from £21.50, in the County Enclosure it’s from £33 but the Premier Lounge is sold out.</p>
