      <p>Only, the Range Rover Evoque in question was not revealed in all its splendour, rather it was being hurled onto the back of a tow truck.</p>
      <p>Lebese shared images of the ride that is valued at around R734 000. He joins the likes of Mthokozisi Dube and Jacskon Mabokgwane, who also drive the stunning ride.</p>
