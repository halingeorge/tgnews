        <i>"I have had it with these motherfucking Sith on this motherfucking train!" --GPS1138, Video Game Enthusiast</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/37f8pHH">Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order</a> is the best Star Wars game I've played since <i>Knights of the Old Republic</i>, which is one of the best video games of all time.</p>
      <p>I did not want to buy Fallen Order. I figured that much like all the other bullshit EA opportunities to rake in cash from Star Wars fans, this game would probably suck. The trailers tempted me but the game's protagonist was yet another whiny appearing young white male with resting Sith face.</p>
      <p>Day one and two reviews were so strong I found myself watching others play on Twitch and quickly realized I wanted to play through this adventure myself. I bought the game.</p>
      <p>Meet Cal Kestis, a young man who was formerly a Jedi Padawan. Having survived Order 66, Cal starts the game with all the cringe-inducing drama and angst of a Star Wars Jedi trainee. Cal is trying to keep his force powers hidden but must use them to save a pal, thus ensuring the Inquisitors immediately arrive and he must run.</p>
      <p>BD-1 rapidly becomes Cal's droid pal and is the most useful and fun droid in a Star Wars game yet. I feel obligated to say BD BD BD often. Cere, Greez and number of other characters aid you on your mission to do what most every single non-Skywalker Star Wars story has seemed to invovle for ages: Jedi babies.</p>
      <p>
        <i>THERE WAS A LASAT JEDI MASTER!</i>
      </p>
      <p>The levels and world design are wonderful. Creatures, bosses, sounds, terrain, all of it is Star Wars. I feel more immersed in a Star Wars world than even going to Disneyland could manage. Gameplay, while lots of folks are saying "This is Darksouls" reminds me very much of Witcher 3 but without any of the jerky frame-rate problems in combat.</p>
      <p>
        <i>YOU MAY WANT TO TURN ON INVERTED CAMERA LOOK -- IT IS HIDDEN ON A CONTROLLER OPTIONS SCREEN THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT SCROLLS DOWN. SCROLL DOWN, INVERT Y-AXIS.</i>
      </p>
      <p>I am really enjoying playing through this story! I am 5 or 6 hours in and understand it'll take 18-24 hrs total. I have been switching difficulty from Jedi Knight to Jedi Master as I go. You may increase or decrease difficulty as much as you like, even playing in a super easy "Story Mode" for folks who just want the Star Wars lore.</p>
      <p>I absolutely recommend players NOT get held up trying to reach things they can see but are struggling to figure out! New Jedi skills are acquired later in the game that will force you to return to those maps! Areas are not meant to be visited once and only once! I suspect the final scene may be at the spot the game started.</p>
      <p>While Cal's face is set in a constant grimace, I am thrilled with Jedi Fallen Order.</p>
      <p>I am playing on an Xbox One X, I hear PC and Playstation are also wonderful.</p>
