      <p>A convicted criminal considered a key suspect in the kidnapping and torture of a Northern Ireland businessman died from a suspected “cardiac event” after being handcuffed during his arrest, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Cyril McGuinness, known as “Dublin Jimmy”, was seen to smoke three cigarettes and drink a cup of tea while sitting on a sofa following his arrest at around 7am in the Buxton area of Derbyshire on November 8.</p>
      <p>Chesterfield Coroner’s Court was told McGuinness, who “already had a diseased heart” collapsed 60-90 minutes later at the address on Rockfield Road and was pronounced dead at around 10am.</p>
      <p>Police called an ambulance and attempted resuscitation immediately but the 54-year-old died almost three hours after his arrest.</p>
      <p>The raid was part of a co-ordinated series of search operations, mainly focused on the Irish border area, linked to the brutal attack on Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) director Kevin Lunney in September.</p>

      <p>Mr Lunney, 50, was abducted outside his home near Derrylin, Co Fermanagh, and taken to a horsebox across the border, where he was savagely beaten.</p>
      <p>His attackers broke his leg, sliced his fingernails and face with a Stanley knife, carved QIH on his chest, and doused the father-of-six in bleach.</p>
      <p>The attack was the most serious in a five-year campaign of intimidation targeting the companies and directors that now control the business portfolio built up by fallen tycoon Sean Quinn, once Ireland’s richest man.</p>
      <p>The opening of the inquest on Monday was told “no trauma” had led to McGuinness’s death and it was likely that he died as a result of a cardiac event due to an “already diseased heart”.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence at the inquest opener on Monday, Detective Sergeant Steve Simmons said the death was automatically referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p>

      <p>Outlining the events leading up to McGuinness’s death, Mr Simmons said: “The circumstances are that Derbyshire Police attended an address in Buxton at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>“Mr McGuinness was arrested at about 7am, was placed in handcuffs, and approximately an hour to an hour-and-a-half later, he collapsed.</p>
      <p>“During that time there was a search of his property.”</p>
      <p>Senior Coroner for Derby and Derbyshire Dr Robert Hunter told the officer it was his understanding that McGuinness “was sat on the sofa and had three cigarettes and a cup of tea”.</p>
      <p>Mr Simmons added: “Police present began resuscitation straight away and contacted the ambulance service.</p>
      <p>“Mr McGuinness was pronounced dead at 9.55am.”</p>
      <p>Dr Hunter adjourned the inquest until the conclusion of the IOPC investigation.</p>
