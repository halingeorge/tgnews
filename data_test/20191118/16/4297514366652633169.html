        <b>Employees of the Rosewood Hotel Georgia have been out at picket lines since talks broke off on Sept. 21</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hotel workers who have been striking for more than two months have reached a “tentative” agreement with their employers.</p>
      <p>Employees of the Rosewood Hotel Georgia have been out at picket lines <a href="https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/news/over-200-hotel-georgia-hospitality-workers-join-open-ended-strike/">since talks broke off on Sept. </a><a href="https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/news/over-200-hotel-georgia-hospitality-workers-join-open-ended-strike/">21</a>. The four other luxury hotels that went on strike in September, Westin Bayshore, Hyatt Regency, Pinnacle Harbourfront and Four Seasons hotels, reached a deal last month.</p>
      <p>According to a statement from Unite Here Local 40, which represents the hotel workers, their members have till Monday at 5 p.m. to vote to ratify the deal.</p>
      <p>If it passes, it will mean an end to an eight week long strike.</p>
      <p>“We’ve shown this hotel and others in Vancouver that hotel workers will fight for respect and a fair workplace,” said May Tanjusay, room attendant and union bargaining committee member from Rosewood Hotel Georgia.</p>
