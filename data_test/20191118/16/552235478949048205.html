      <h2>Christmas is big money in the music industry.</h2>

      <p>Musicians and DJs make most of their money <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/entertainment">performing live</a> across the world, selling merchandise and making guest appearances.</p>
      <p>But in an age of ever-evolving technology, where physical record purchases are less popular, what is the earning potential of online streaming, especially over the festive period?</p>
      <p>It has been revealed, Mariah Carey is the most streamed artist at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> with her hit All I Want for Christmas making her over £1million from Spotify alone.</p>

      <p>According to new research by Broadband Deals, the report reveals the American singer has beaten 'King of Christmas' Michael Buble to take the top spot.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://broadbanddeals.co.uk/pay-per-play/">Pay Per Play</a> report highlights that artists get paid £0.0034 per every stream on Spotify.</p>
      <p>And it turns out any singer who has featured on a John Lewis Christmas advert has also cashed in.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lily-allen">Lily Allen's</a> Somewhere Only We Know is the most streamed with 189.6 million plays to date - generating the artist £647,311.68 through Spotify alone.</p>
      <p>Her single featured in the 2013 Christmas advert, which cost the brand £6million to make. But Allen revealed she was paid just £8,000 for her collaboration meaning she made more money through Spotify plays as a result of featuring and promoting the single.</p>
