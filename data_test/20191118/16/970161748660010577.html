      <h1>Yodel delivery driver leaves bluetooth speakers in the toilet</h1>

      <p>A disgruntled customer says a parcel was dumped through her bathroom window and straight into her loo.</p>
      <p>Rebeka Alam, 21, had ordered the package on Yodel last month and received an email telling her it had been delivered while she was at work.</p>
      <p>After returning home she was handed a note by her mum’s partner telling her the package had been dropped through ‘the open window [at the] side of the house’.</p>
      <p>She prayed the toilet seat had been left down but her worst fears were confirmed when she went to the bathroom to find her new speakers ruined by toilet water.</p>
      <p>Rebeka, from Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, says Yodel have washed their hands of the problem by telling her to complain to the seller instead of them.</p>

      <p>The disgruntled shopper said: ‘I’ve seen stories, I’ve heard stories, but never as bad as it landing in the toilet. It could only happen to me.’ Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>As soon as she as handed the note left by the delivery driver, Rebeka knew exactly where her parcel was going to be.</p>
      <p>She says the family don’t usually leave any windows open in the house except for a tiny one in the bathroom, which doesn’t have an extractor fan.</p>
      <p>When Rebeka returned home that evening her mum’s partner had already fished the parcel out of the loo, but not before taking a snap of the floater.</p>
      <p>Despite allowing a few hours for it to dry off, she opened the packaging and found water had gone ‘all over’ her speaker.</p>

      <p>She says it wouldn’t turn on the first time and she doesn’t want to test it out again because it’s electrical.</p>
      <p>Rebeka added: ‘The value wasn’t excessive, but that’s no the point. It’s the principle.’</p>
      <p>The unhappy customer says she was on the phone to Yodel for half an hour before the adviser admitted to giving her the wrong information.</p>
      <p>She was urged to scrap everything that had been said and was told to contact the seller, let them know the item has been damaged and that they would then have to raise a complaint with the company.</p>

      <p>Rebeka emailed the seller, send them pictures and was told she would get a refund.</p>
      <p>After hunting online for Yodel’s Facebook page she says she saw a number of stories about packages being dropped off in people’s bins.</p>
      <p>The company’s chief operating officer Carl Moore said: ‘The safe delivery of parcels is our number one priority so we are disappointed that this driver has broken our strict protocols.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve been in touch with Ms Alam to apologise for her experience. We invest heavily in training and will be taking appropriate action with the driver.’</p>
