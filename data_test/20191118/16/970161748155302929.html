      <p>Michelle Keegan has given herself a super makeover with her latest glam.</p>
      <p>The former Coronation Street star has shared a gorgeous photo of herself in a leather corset after a recently glam session. For what, we don’t know. All we do know is that her cute pooch got in on the action too.</p>
      <p>Captioning the photo, she said: ‘Make up &amp; hair did.</p>
      <p>‘Beauty light.</p>
      <p>‘Dog upstaging me.’</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to comment on the Our Girl star’s change of appearance.</p>
      <p>While agreeing that Michelle, 32, looked ‘beautiful’ as ever, many of them pointed out that she looked different.</p>
      <p>An overwhelming number of heart eye and fire emojis were used by friends and fans throughout the comments.</p>
      <p>People posted compliments like ‘unreal’, ‘super hot’ and ‘stunning’.</p>

      <p>Of course there were also the fans who loved her dog.</p>
      <p>Michelle is right in the midst of filming Brassic series 2, a comedy series set in Lancashire, and so getting a moment for herself is probably pretty difficult right now.</p>
      <p>The star, who is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/11/how-long-have-mark-wright-and-michelle-keegan-been-together-and-when-did-they-get-married-10722803/">married to former footballer and TOWIE guy Mark Wright</a> in 2015, admits that these periods of being away from her husband are difficult.</p>
      <p>It was particularly hard when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/20/michelle-keegan-admits-marriage-mark-wright-really-tough-long-distance-10776316/">she was away in Malaysia for Our Girl filming</a> and Mark was in LA on a presenting job.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the actress is clearly getting on with things and trying to have a laugh while she does so, pictured recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/09/michelle-keegan-laugh-set-brassic-series-2-filming-kicks-off-10711190/">having fun on the set of Brassic in Manchester</a>.</p>
