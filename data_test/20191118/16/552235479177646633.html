      <h1>John Potter set for Jack Ross reunion as Hibs approach Sunderland about move</h1>
      <h2>The 39-year-old moved to the Stadium of Light as first team coach under Ross and could link up with him again.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:03:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>John Potter could become <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross’</a> assistant after Sunderland boss Phil Parkinson admitted there had been contact with Hibs.</p>
      <p>Potter moved to the Stadium of Light with Ross as first team coach but with James Fowler deciding to join <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> as head of football operations, there’s an opening for the assistant role at Hibs.</p>
      <p>And Potter could be reunited with the new <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> gaffer if a deal is agreed between the two clubs - with Sunderland set to demand compensation.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: “There has been contact between Hibs and Sunderland about John Potter.</p>
      <p>"We are having further talks about that this afternoon.</p>
      <p>"There is the obvious lure of going back to Scotland for John and if he does go, we will wish him all the best.”</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dunfermline-athletic-fc">Dunfermline</a> boss Potter also had a spell as U20s manager at the Pars.</p>

      <p>Ross is determined to make a name for himself as Hibs boss but insisted he wouldn't be using the club as a stepping stone to go back to England.</p>
      <p>He said: That’s part of the attraction for me as well in the early discussions we had, is the want for me to be here for a number of years.</p>
      <p>"I’m not here to use it as a stepping stone or a platform, I want to be a successful Hibs manager and I want to be here for the long term.</p>
      <p>"I suppose my other answer for that is I went to a club where there was a high frequency in changes of managers and I think I was the longest serving since Steve Bruce so I did okay in that respect, I could have been there for longer but certainly the ambition here is to be here for a long period of time."</p>
