      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/harry-potter"><i>Harry Potter</i></a> star Tom Felton has admitted he would like to play the role of Draco Malfoy again.</p>
      <p>The actor portrayed Potter’s school nemesis over franchise’s eight movies but has revealed he’s not done yet; he’d take the opportunity to play Malfoy again in the future.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“Go back to Hogwarts one more time? Yeah, I’m endlessly proud and affectionate of young Draco, so any chance to reprise that role would be great,” Felton told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7687295/Tom-Felton-EXC-Harry-Potter-star-praises-Emma-Watson-says-hed-call-self-partnered.html"><i>MailOnline</i></a>.</p>
      <p>However, Felton joked that if the series’ original stars return they should swap roles, adding: “I think we should come back and do the opposite, Rupert [Grint] should play Draco, I’ll play Hermione, Dan can play Dobby, and Emma can be Hagrid, it’s the perfect re-casting!</p>
      <p>“It’ll be an interesting spin [on it]. But, seriously, if there was another chance to be in another movie then I’m sure all of us would jump at the chance to be part of it.”</p>

      <p>Felton also admitted he thinks the franchise will “definitely” be rebooted in the future, suggesting he could play Draco’s father Lucius if that were to happen.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think Jo [Rowling] would want her films, her books rather and her films, to be remade anytime soon, but I’m sure in 20 years when they’ve got 4D, scratch-and-sniff cinemas, or whatever, then they’ll want to do it all over again,” he said.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“My hope is that when they do it I’ll be old enough to play Lucius! Give it another 15 years and I’ll come back and play Lucius. I would do it in a heartbeat.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Felton recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/harry-potter-tom-felton-throwback-video-emma-watson-daniel-radcliffe-2552889">shared a throwback video</a> of himself with co-stars Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe during the filming of <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i>.</p>
