      <h1>Magic therapy cuts anxiety of kids in the hospital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:16:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author">Gregory Filiano-Stony Brook</a></address>
      <p>A program called MagicAid helped significantly reduce anxiety for both kids in the hospital and their parents or caregivers by about 25%, research finds.</p>
      <p>The experience of stress and fear upon hospitalization is frequent with <a href="https://www.futurity.org/children-with-depression-hospitals-2051572-2/">pediatric patients</a>.</p>
      <p>The findings suggest that a magic therapy program for pediatric inpatient care may have great value to patients and caregivers while they’re in the hospital.</p>
      <p>MagicAid magic therapy is an interactive therapy that uses magic tricks and magic sessions designed to alleviate patient anxiety. MagicAid is a non-profit organization that Harrison Pravder, a fourth-year medical student at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, cofounded. Stony Brook Children’s runs the program under the guidance of professionals in the Child Life Program.</p>
      <p>“It is important to develop tools to facilitate coping and encourage distraction for patients due to anxieties associated with hospitalization,” says Pravder.</p>
      <p>“Anxiety often arises due to loss of self-determination and separation from home and family in patients, while, for parents, stress is often related to their <a href="https://www.futurity.org/intravenous-antibiotics-at-home-kids-2132552/">child’s hospitalization</a> and other concerns such as financial costs, and this stress can translate back to the child.”</p>
      <p>Pravder and his colleagues found a majority of patients and parents to be receptive to magic therapy and willing to participate. They evaluated 100 inpatients ages 5 to 16 years and 90 caregivers at Stony Brook Children’s. The researchers randomly assigned patient-caregiver pairs to a magic therapy intervention group or control group. The magic therapy included a session of watching magic, learning how to perform a magic trick, and receiving a magic prop to practice in order to perform for others.</p>
      <p>Researchers measured anxiety before and after the magic interventions by using validated self-report tools. These included a <a href="https://www.futurity.org/eeg-test-pain-opioids-1905992/">facial image scale</a> and the venham picture test for younger patients and for older children a pictoral scale and a written scale signifying anxiety levels. They evaluated caregivers’ anxiety level using only the written linear scale, called the short State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).</p>
      <p>After analyzing the results they found that the patient magic group’s standard anxiety reduced by 25% after the magic therapy, and the caregiver magic group’s anxiety reduced by 24%.</p>
      <p>Part of the study included a questionnaire for health professionals designed to assess the usefulness of magic reducing anxiety and the feasibility of such a program in a healthcare setting.</p>
      <p>Based on the results of 37 physicians and nurses surveyed at Stony Brook on the topic, 98% recommended continuance of the program, 97% reported that the student magicians were not a disturbance in the healthcare setting, 81% reported that the activity is helpful to the child, and 57% reported it as helpful to parents.</p>
