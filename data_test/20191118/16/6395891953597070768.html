      <p><b>SRINAGAR, IndiaÂ (AP)</b> - An avalanche hit an Indian army post Monday on a Himalayan glacier in the disputed Kashmir region, trapping at least eight soldiers under snow, the army said.</p>
      <p>The avalanche struck the post at a height of 5,485 meters (17,995 feet) in the northern part of the Siachen Glacier and a search and rescue operation was underway, said army spokesman Lt. Col. Devender Anand.</p>
      <p>The glacier is on the northern tip of the divided Kashmir region claimed by India and Pakistan in an area known as the world's highest battlefield.</p>
      <p>The two countries have deployed troops at elevations of up to 6,700 meters (21,982 feet).</p>
      <p>There have been intermittent skirmishes since 1984 and more soldiers have died from the harsh weather there than combat.</p>
      <p>In 2017, at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in three avalanches. In 2012, a massive avalanche in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir killed 140 people, including 129 Pakistani soldiers.</p>
