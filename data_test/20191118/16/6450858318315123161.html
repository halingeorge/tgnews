      <p>How sci-fi that we can talk to a device and have it talk back to us. Smart speakers are here to stay, and Amazon is leading the way with its <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06Y5ZW72J/?ascsubtag=06-3686868-11-0000000">Echo range and built-in Alexa voice assistant</a>.</p>
      <p>But the regular Echo smart speaker isn’t the only Alexa device available. Amazon sells several different ones and they all do things a little differently. Combined, they hold 75% of the UK smart speaker market, according to a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3686868-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Fdigital-home%2Fbest-amazon-echo-3686868%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fyougov.co.uk%2F">YouGov</a> survey. </p>
      <p>Most of them are smart speakers. These are devices suited to indoor home use that respond to voice commands when connected to Wi-Fi.</p>
      <p>You can say something simple like "Alexa, what’s the time?" right up to "Alexa, turn the lights on in the kitchen" – the latter if you have set up a compatible product.</p>
      <p>This is the cool thing about Alexa products. You can use them as simply or as intricately as you like.</p>
      <p>In September 2019 Amazon announced many <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/gadget/everything-amazon-announced-2019-event-3702831/">new and updated Echo devices</a>. We have reviewed the new third-gen Echo and Echo Dot with Clock and Echo Studio, and will test out the Echo Show 8 shortly.</p>
      <p>There’s also the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/digital-home/amazon-echo-show-5-3697413/">Echo Show 5</a>, which is an inexpensive alternative to the 10in model - the number refers to the screen size: 5.5in.</p>
      <p>If you think you want a voice assistant smart speaker, one of these Echo devices is going to fit the bill.</p>
      <p>All the models on this list can do basic things like answer web searches, play music and radio and even call other Echos or smartphones. Read on to see what they all do differently, but also check out these <a href="http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/digital-home/best-amazon-echo-accessories-3699219/">great accessories</a> for the various Echo devices including the Wall Clock and Echo Connect.</p>
      <h3>Should I buy an Echo now or wait for Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year, and in 2019 takes place on <b>29 November</b>. We're already seeing some great consumer tech deals and expect them to continue right into January, with <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday deals</a> followed by <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/gadget/best-cyber-monday-deals-3667890/">Cyber Monday deals</a>, Christmas deals, Boxing day deals and then we've got the January sales.</p>
      <p>That's both good and bad, of course, because how do you know that a product won't drop in price the very next week? The truth is you can never be entirely sure, but we're now close enough to the main event that many retailers have already begun their Black Friday sales. Of the big UK retailers, Currys has started its <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3686868-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsearch-keywords%2Fxx_xx_xx_xx_xx%2F-why_wait-%2Fxx-criteria.html">Why Wait? sale</a>, guaranteeing that products won't drop any further in price for Black Friday, while <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Friday-Deals/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;node=161428031&amp;ascsubtag=06-3686868-11-0000000">Amazon</a> has a range of Black Friday Countdown deals, with its main event starting on 22 November. </p>
      <p>They aren't the only ones, and we've been busy hunting down the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/gadget/echo-deals-3680483/">best Echo deals</a> so that you don't have to. While prices may go down further for Black Friday, some discounts will also end sooner, so unless you're sure that a product will be discounted it's always best to take a deal at face value: if you think the product is worth that amount of money, go for it. Sometimes it doesn't pay to hold out for something that will never happen.</p>

        <p>This is the Amazon Echo to buy if you care about sound quality. You still need to subscribe to a music streaming service that offers 'HD' music and, not coincidentaly, Amazon's own is the current one to go for.</p>
        <p>The Studio doesn't only do hi-res audio: it also supports so-called 3D audio. Currently it can play Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio, which can be both music and video soundtracks.</p>
        <p>Best of all, it's way cheaper than rivals from Apple and Google.</p>

          <p>This latest Echo Dot sounds a lot better, looks a lot better and is great value at this price. You can even pair two Dots for stereo sound.</p>
          <p>It's a great entry into the world of Alexa to listen to radio, podcast and music as well as ask queries. You can have one, or put several about the house. </p>

            <p>It may cost the same as the Lenovo Smart Clock, but it includes a couple of key features you might want, such as Bluetooth and a camera. The screen is a little small for watching video, but it's a great size for a bedside table.</p>

              <p>The Amazon Echo 3 is a great improvement on the Echo 2 not only in terms of design but audio output too. It's very similar to the second-gen Echo Plus, featuring the same 3in subwoofer and 0.8in tweeter that provides crisp vocals and booming bass, but you miss out on the smart hub and thermometer functionality.</p>
              <p>Still, for £89.99/$99.99, it's a great-sounding smart speaker that'll be able to answer almost any query you throw at it - just make sure you've got the appropriate Skill enabled first. </p>

                <p>The Echo Dot with Clock is a great alternative to the regular Echo Dot, especially if you plan to use it on your nightstand. It’s a relatively minor change but it’s genuinely helpful to be able to see the time and how long is left on a timer. </p>
                <p>So if those are two features you like the sound of, the Dot with Clock is well worth the extra money.</p>

                    <p>It's expensive, but the 2nd-gen Echo Show is a good upgrade on the original. If you want Alexa with a screen this is a good option. It lets you call other people with Alexa devices, look up stuff online and watch Amazon Prime video. Just remember that it needs to be plugged in, it's not a tablet.</p>
                    <p>Audio is decent and the screen is a good size but unless you really want the visual element or ability to call other Shows, you'd be better off with the Echo or the Echo Plus. And if you do want a screen but a more affordable price, look to the Echo Show 5.</p>
