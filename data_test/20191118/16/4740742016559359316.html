      <h1>How well are Bristol City, Leeds United, Nottingham Forest and rest of the Championship backed in the promotion race</h1>
      <h2>The latest Championship winner and promotion odds from The Pools</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:22:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:22</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clark</a></address>
      <p>Fulham host Queens Park Rangers this Friday as the seesaw nature of the Championship returns to our screens after 16 rounds of wild action already.</p>
      <p>Just seven points separate seventh-place Fulham and league leaders West Bromwich Albion, while Birmingham City way down in 13th are only six points off the play-off spots.</p>
      <p>With well over half of the league still dreaming of a push for the play-offs and potentially promotion, the latest odds on the Championship certainly make for interesting reading.</p>
      <p>It's no surprise that West Brom are among the title favourites and they share the shortest odds with <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_D1/">The Pools</a> alongside Leeds United, who are currently third and two points adrift of the Baggies.</p>
      <p>Fulham, meanwhile, are the third favourites to life the Championship trophy ahead of the likes of Preston North End and Brentford who round out the top five.</p>
      <p>When it comes to promotion odds, the prices are a little shorter.</p>
      <p>Leeds are priced at 1/4, West Brom 1/2, Fulham 11/8, Preston 14/5, while Brentford again round out the top five at 3/1.</p>
      <p>Here are the Championship winner and promotion odds courtesy of <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_D1/">The Pools</a>.</p>
