      <p>She is a young numismatist from Kanniyakumari district with over 2,500 coins in her collection. Her dream is to become an IAS officer.</p>
      <p>What is more, she was honoured by Puducherry Lieutenant Governor and former IPS officer Kiran Bedi on the occasion of Children’s Day this year.</p>
      <p>A class 5 student of Mar Ivanios School in Kuzhithurai, Winny’s collection comprises international and Indian coins, some from the 1920s.</p>
      <p>Rare coins such as one paisa (1917), two paisa (1920) and other old ones such as 10, 20 and 25 paisa coins are part of her collection.</p>
      <p>She has also taken efforts to collect commemorative coins released in remembrance of leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Netaji Subash Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhai Patel and Indira Gandhi.</p>
      <p>Winny started her hobby at the age of five. “Whenever a relative comes from abroad, she insists on coins instead of gifts,” said her father Justin Antony.</p>
      <p>She was invited to showcase her collection in Nagercoil and Puducherry.</p>
      <p>Winny aims to become an IAS officer and wants to help the poor, adds her father.</p>
