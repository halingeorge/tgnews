      <p>Love Island's Caroline Flack has given fans a first glimpse of the first shots from the upcoming Winter Love Island.</p>
      <p>The presenter teases fans this week with some shots from behind the scenes as she starts filming show promos.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> confirmed earlier this year that a 'winter version' of the show will air in 2020, and is expected to kick off as early as January 8th.</p>
      <p>The premise of the show is still the same, except instead of the sunny Majorcan villa we've all grown accustomed to, the Islanders will be shacking up in South Africa for six weeks meaning that fans will for the first time get a double helping of Love Island in 2020.</p>
      <p>Caroline is currently in Cape Town, where the winter series will be filmed and showed off her look for the first day of filming.</p>
      <p>Sharing images on Instagram as she posed in a stunning yellow dress, she wrote "Day 1 shoot," the blond beauty wrote, "Hair and makeup by @gemflossi."</p>

      <p>She added: "So we've just landed in Cape Town, We're here to film the advert for Love Island season six. We're not really sure what to expect, because we're not used to filming for Love Island during the winter."</p>
      <p>Later she added: "Just finished the first shot of the day.</p>
      <p>"To begin with a had this yellow dress on, it looked so weird. I looked by I'd been run over by a roller and someone tried to plump me back up again.</p>
      <p>"I'm never wearing that dress again."</p>
      <p>As well as Caroline, fans will be happy to know that comedian Iain Stirling will again be lending his voice to the show as the drama unfolds.</p>
      <p>However former stars including Dubliner Yewande Biala have admitted they are not convinced the winter version of Love Island is going to be a success.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/meath">Meath</a> scientist, who competed in this summer's series of the ITV2 dating show, believes that because the show will be on twice a year there won't be as much hype surrounding it.</p>
      <p>"I think the first one obviously... Everyone's still in the Love Island bubble, everyone wants something, they're hungry for something," she told Metro.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"I feel like the first one will actually do really well. But I feel like after that it might gradually get less views, because everyone will be like, 'oh, it's on again. I'll catch it next time.'</p>
      <p>"They won't be watching it on the go as they normally do. I think the views might drop because of that."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/love-island-yewande-george-split-20702218">Yewande</a> continued: "Because it's once a year, you can't miss it. You have to watch it [while] on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is so hooked because you don't want to miss that day. Whereas if it's all the time, you're like, 'it doesn't matter, there's going to be another one in two months' time."</p>
