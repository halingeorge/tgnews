      <h1>Brazil says Amazon deforestation is worst since 2008</h1>

      <p><b>RIO DE JANEIROÂ (AP)</b> - A report by a Brazilian government agency says the rate of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is at its highest in more than a decade.</p>
      <p>The National Institute for Space Research said Monday that deforestation between August 2018 and July 2019 reached 9,762 square kilometers (3,769 square miles), a 30 percent increase over the previous year and the most since 2008.</p>
      <p>Concern about the Amazon heightened after President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January. He advocates the loosening of protections for natural reserves and indigenous lands as a way to promote economic development.</p>
      <p>Fires in the Amazon spread at a pace unseen since 2010 in July and August, then slowed in September.</p>
      <p>Environment ministry officials say they will meet the Amazon region's governors Thursday to discuss ways to reduce deforestation.</p>
