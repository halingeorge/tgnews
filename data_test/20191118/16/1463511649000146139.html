      <p>Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Monday  congratulated the Governor-elect of Bayelsa, Chief David Lyon, describing his victory in  the Saturday’s governorship election as a major turning point for APC.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by Ojo Oyewamide, Senior Special Assistant to Akeredolu on Media and Publicity, in Akure, the governor also congratulated his Kogi counterpart, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, on his re-election.</p>
      <p>Akeredolu equally congratulated the APC – All Progressives Congress – for victory in the elections.</p>
      <p>“The outcomes of the elections in the two states have, once again, endeared the APC to the hearts of the people.</p>
      <p>“It is particularly heart-warming that Al­haji Yahaya Bello is returning as Governor of Kogi. I wish him the best as he continues to lead the good people of the state.</p>
      <p>“For Chief David Lyo­n, the Governor-elect of Bayelsa, his emergence is a major turning point.</p>
      <p>“Although, Edo had blazed the trail for long, the journey to plant the seeds of our great party in the Niger Delta has not been easy, understandably.</p>
      <p>“The Bayelsa feat is a great leap. All those who toiled to bring to fruition, this comforting be­rth deserve commenda­tion,” he said.</p>
      <p>The governor described APC’s victory in Bayelsa as the needed elixir for the party to take firm roots in the Niger De­lta.</p>
      <p>“The real victory belongs to those who sacrificed their ti­me and energy for the successful conduct of the two election­s.</p>
      <p>“Most profoundly, therefore, I specially salute the quality leadership individually provided by Governors Nasir el-Rufai and Abubakar Badaru of Kaduna and Jigawa states, respectively.</p>
      <p>“As Chairmen of the APC National Campaign Councils for the two elections, they displayed dexterity on all fronts with candour and thoroughness. All members of both councils deserve no less commendations.</p>
      <p>“INEC, security agencies and even the participants also contributed in no small measure to the outcomes,”Akeredolu said. </p>
