      <h1>Before Black Friday hits - save $30 on the Razer BlackWidow Essential mechanical gaming keyboard</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:59:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/alice-newcome-beill/" target="_blank">Alice Newcome-Beill</a></address>
      <p>You don't always have to spend a ton of cash to nab yourself a sick gaming keyboard. Right now the Razer Blackwidow Essential is available at Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Essential-Hypershift-Keystrokes/dp/B07JG22758">for just $55 ($27 off)</a>. While the "essential" name might be indicative of a lack of features, all of the trappings of a top-tier mechanical keyboard are still present here. Multiple profiles, extensive customization software, all paired with durable mechanical switches with full ten key roll-over and anti-ghosting to make sure every keystroke is registered properly.    </p>
      <p>This keyboard may only feature green backlighting, but the synapse software still provides you with a massive suite of per-key lighting options. Besides the lighting, the Synapse software allows you to assign a string of functions to specific keys and Razer's "Hypershift" technology that debuted with Synapse 3 allows you to quickly swap between key functions with just a single key. The BlackWidow Essential comes equipped with Razer's proprietary, clicky green switch, rated for up to 80 million keystrokes, and also features function key integrated media controls.</p>
