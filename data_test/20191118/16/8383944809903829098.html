      <p>Two men and a woman were fatally shot Monday outside a Walmart store in southwestern Oklahoma, the chief of police said.</p>
      <p>Two victims were shot inside a car and the third was in the parking lot outside the store in Duncan, Police Chief Danny Ford said.</p>
      <p>Police are looking for witnesses to the shooting, Ford said.</p>
      <p>No staff members were involved in the shooting and the store was not evacuated, Walmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins said in an email.</p>
      <p>"This was an isolated incident in the parking lot and was not an active shooter situation," Jenkins said.</p>
      <p>Police said in a Facebook post that a handgun was found at the scene.</p>
