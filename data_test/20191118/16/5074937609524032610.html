      <p>Accra, Nov. 18, GNA - The Black Stars of Ghana recorded their second win in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying campaign after dispatching Sao Tome and Principe 1-0 at the Estadio Nacional Stadium.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ayew solitary strike from the penalty spot earned the Black Stars all three points as they moved top of Group C with six points while South Africa and Sudan are on three points each after two games. Sao Tome and Principe are at the bottom of the group with no point.</p>
      <p>The Black Stars begun the game on the front foot on a very difficult turf, mounting relentless pressure on the Sao Tome who stood resolute in the opening minutes of the game.</p>
      <p>Ghana Striker, Emmanuel Boateng was handed the early opportunity past the 20th minute mark but couldn't capitalize on the exquisite pass from Jordan Ayew.</p>
      <p>Ghana controlled the game in the first half but couldn't penetrate the defence of the home side as they were often left to shoot outside the box.</p>
      <p>The first half ended scoreless with Ghana have about 77 percent of ball possession with the home virtually creating nothing in the opposition's half.</p>
      <p>Ghana begun the second half on the bright note, as they searched for the lead and were deservedly awarded a penalty after Sao Tome goalkeeper Gilmar Evsebio brought down Emmanuel Boateng after he poorly handled a feeble shot.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ayew stepped up and struck Ghana home from the penalty spot on the 49th minute mark. The home side responded very well after going a goal down as they look to create something in the attacking third.</p>
      <p>Sao Tome's attacking prowess obviously lacked the quality to break the Ghana defence who managed to hold onto their one goal lead.</p>
