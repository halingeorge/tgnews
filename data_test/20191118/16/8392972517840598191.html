      <p>Lisa captioned the post: "Just two actors sitting on a polar bear @katiexmcglynn #polarbear #icerink #mediacity #corrie #beth #sinead."</p>
      <p>Lisa is currently in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/dancing-on-ice-corrie-actress-lisa-george-confirmed-as-sixth-contestant/">training for Dancing On Ice</a>, so she should be no stranger to the ice rink!</p>
      <p>The two actress worked together on the soap until recently.</p>
      <p>Last month, Katie's character Sinead died from cancer leaving her family and friends devastated.</p>
      <p>Sinead <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-cruel-blunder-sinead-tinker-cancer/">was diagnosed with cervical cancer</a> last year while she was pregnant with her son Bertie.</p>

      <p>She refused treatment, wanting to put her unborn baby's life first.</p>
      <p>After giving birth she immediately had treatment.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year she was told that her tumour had shrunk and the cancer showed no signs of spreading. However, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-sinead-tinker-makes-big-decision-about-cancer-treatment/">just months later she found a lump on her neck</a>.</p>
      <p>It was then confirmed her cancer had spread and she didn't have much longer left to live.</p>
