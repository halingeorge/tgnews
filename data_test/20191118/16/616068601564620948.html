      <p>The co-accused in a home invasion robbery and shooting in Penticton last month will have to wait until tomorrow to learn if they will receive bail.</p>
      <p>Jesse Mason, 32, and Josef Pavlik, 36, appeared side-by-side in orange and red prison jumpsuits via video link from the Okanagan Corrections Centre for a bail hearing that ran most of Monday at the Penticton courthouse.</p>
      <p>The men are charged in an alleged home invasion and shooting at a Winnipeg Street home on October 2. </p>
      <p>The contents of the bail hearing are covered by a routine publication ban, but alleged victims Michael Paseska and Sarah Edwards spoke with reporters and <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/267385/awakened-by-a-gun-in-face">told their side of the story</a> the day after.</p>
      <p>The pair said they had been sleeping in bed when the men woke them up with the firearm.</p>
      <p>Paseska said Josef Pavlik struck him with the butt of the handgun, which was fired four to five times inside the bedroom. A bullet grazed Paseska’s face, leaving him with a minor wound.</p>
      <p>RCMP said in a news release the men then fled to a home on Maple Street, where an hours-long standoff occurred. During the standoff, police could be heard calling for a "Jesse" repeatedly, urging him to come out. Both Mason and Pavlik were arrested at the home, police said.</p>
      <p>Judge Michelle Daneliuk reserved her decision on bail until Tuesday. </p>
      <p>This is Mason’s second shot at bail. He is back in prison after <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/269567/standoff-suspect-back-in-jail">allegedly violating his curfew</a> on the same day he was released on October 22. Tuesday’s hearing was Pavlik’s first attempt at bail. </p>
      <p>Mason is charged with a single count of break and enter for the incident while Pavlik is facing counts of break and enter, armed robbery, assault with a weapon and uttering threats. </p>
      <p>Pavlik, who has a lengthy criminal record, also has outstanding charges for allegedly driving while prohibited on two occasions.</p>
