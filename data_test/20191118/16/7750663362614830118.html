      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gareth-bale/"><b>Gareth Bale</b></a> believes <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/wales/"><b>Wales</b></a> reaching the European Championship next summer could trump the achievement of playing at Euro 2016.</h2>

      <p>Wales ended a 58-year wait to play at a major tournament in 2016 and eventually reached the semi-finals in France under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-coleman/"><b>Chris Coleman</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Over three years on and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-giggs/"><b>Ryan Giggs</b></a>' young side will qualify for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/euro-2020/"><b>Euro 2020</b></a> by beating Hungary at home on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>"The experience of qualifying for the Euros was massive," Bale said ahead of the winner-takes-all clash in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>"It was something I'd never done before and to do it again might be a bit more impressive.</p>
      <p>"The youngsters have come in and done really well.</p>
      <p>"We've got a good mix of youth and experience and it's important they step up to the plate, which they have been doing.</p>
      <p>"We need to use our experiences to help the youngsters come through it."</p>
      <blockquote>No problems and I'm ready to go for Tuesday<cite>Gareth Bale</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Bale had been out for a month with a calf problem before Wales' 2-0 win in Azerbaijan on Saturday that, coupled with Slovakia's defeat in Croatia, put qualification destiny in their own hands.</p>
      <p>The Real Madrid forward played for an hour before making way for the returning <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aaron-ramsey/"><b>Aaron Ramsey</b></a> and says he is fully fit to take on Hungary at the Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>"I'm ready. I hadn't played in four weeks so it was important to get 60 minutes into my legs and get some match sharpness," Bale said.</p>
      <p>"We spoke at the start of the week about trying to get 60 minutes and hopefully being a couple (of goals) up before I came off.</p>
      <p>"So it worked out well, no problems and I'm ready to go for Tuesday."</p>

      <p>Bale was injured and a helpless spectator in the stands when Wales missed out on a place at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p>
      <p>Wales lost a play-off decider to the Republic of Ireland in Cardiff and the 30-year-old vividly remembers the pain of that defeat.</p>
      <p>"We know the euphoria of qualifying for the Euros and what it feels like to miss out on qualifying for the World Cup," Bale said.</p>
      <p>"So we can use them to our advantage. We don't want to be feeling like we did after the Ireland game.</p>
      <p>"We will push and push not to feel like that again, because it's not a feeling you want in the dressing room after the game.</p>

      <p>"We will use all our experience to try and navigate our way through.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing is we haven't lost since we went to Hungary (in June) and we've been on that upward trajectory.</p>
      <p>"The football has been really good and we have to keep riding that wave."</p>
      <p>Joe Allen, suspended for the Azerbaijan win, is set to return at the expense of Joe Morrell in midfield, even though the on-loan Lincoln youngster acquitted himself well in Baku.</p>
      <p>Giggs' main selection dilemma revolves around Ramsey and whether the Juventus midfielder is fit enough to play 90 minutes.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-wilson/"><b>Harry Wilson</b></a> could start after scoring in Baku, with Ramsey possibly used from the bench again.</p>
      <p>"Experience counts for a lot," Giggs said.</p>
      <p>"But what I've seen in the young players, coming in and being fearless, they help each other.</p>
      <p>"The older players can help the young ones and vice versa."</p>
