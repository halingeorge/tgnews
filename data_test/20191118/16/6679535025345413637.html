      <h1>Consumers demand withdrawal of paid parking system</h1>

      <p>The Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations has sought the intervention of the District Collector to withdraw the Tiruchi Corporation move to collect roadside parking fee for vehicles near the Chathram bus stand.</p>
      <p>In a representation, the federation claimed that appropriate permissions were not sought as the road belongs to the State Highways as it connects Karur.</p>
      <p>“The entire area around the Chathram bus stand is congested due to redevelopment works. The parking fee is being levied in an already congested area, which is inconveniencing users. A similar proposal was dropped by the former Corporation Commissioner based on public demand. However, now the civic body has begun issuing tickets," said M. Sekaran, president of the federation.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sekaran also drew the Collector’s attention to the Corporation's ‘illegal condition’ of parking at owner's risk.</p>
      <h3>Supreme Court order</h3>
      <p>“A Supreme Court Order rejected the ‘Owners’ risk’ clause in parking slips. The safety of the vehicles at the parking spot is the responsibility of the Corporation,” he said.</p>
      <p>Instead of asking commercial establishments to provide parking space, common people are being harassed, Mr. Sekaran said.</p>
      <p>He also pointed out that ₹5 per hour for two-wheelers and ₹20 for four-wheelers being charged by the Tiruchi Corporation was an exorbitant amount to pay for parking.</p>
