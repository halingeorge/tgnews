      <p>Unbeaten Indian professional boxer Vijender Singh will take on former Ghanaian Olympian and two-time Commonwealth super middleweight champion Charles Adamu in his next bout in Dubai on November 22.</p>
      <p>The fight is part of the #RotundaRumble2 card, featuring top stars such as WBO super lightweight World No. 1 Jack Catterall and WBO bantamweight World No. 4 Thomas Patrick Ward.</p>
      <p>In his last fight, 34-year-old Vijender had defeated Mike Snider on his US debut in July.</p>
      <p>The WBO Asia Pacific and Oriental super middleweight champion from India holds an 11-0 record, with eight knockouts.</p>
      <p>Adamu, 42, is an experienced boxer with a 33-14-0 record, including 26 knockouts.</p>
      <p>“After having rigorous training sessions for more than two months, I am fully prepared to end my year on a winning note. For me, this fight will be a build-up to the World title I aim to bag in 2020. I am sure my debut fight in Dubai will be exciting and I am looking forward to an early knockout win,” said Vijender.</p>
      <p>Adamu sounded confident as well. “Vijender Singh must know that this fight isn't going to be easy for him…I will put up a tactical masterclass he has never seen before. I have fought more than three times the number of fights he has,” said the Ghanaian.</p>
