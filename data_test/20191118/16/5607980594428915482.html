      <h1>TCL introduces a 10.8 inch, 240 Hz display for gaming tablets</h1>

      <p>There are a handful of <a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/04/razer-blade-15-now-available-with-240hz-display-core-i7-9750h-processor.html">laptops with 240 Hz displays</a>, and even a few <a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/05/asus-rog-strix-xg17-is-a-portable-240-hz-monitor.html">portable monitors</a>. But you know what we haven’t seen yet? A tablet with a screen that refreshes 240 times per second.</p>
      <p>Those could soon be a reality though.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="http://weibo.com/6048569942/IgFHex3fk?from=page_1005056048569942_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1574095507436">post to Chinese social media network Weibo</a>, it looks like TCL is showing off a 10.8 inch, 240 Hz tablet display.</p>

      <p>The screen has a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels which means there are 280 pixels per inch. It also supports up to 500 nits of brightness, and… it features a punch hole in one corner, allowing tablet makers to go for a slim-bezel design by sticking a camera in the screen itself.</p>
      <p>I can’t imagine folks who care about gaming enough to want a 240 Hz display <i>also</i> want a permanent obstruction in the screen. But there’s no word on whether the camera cut-out is optional or mandatory.</p>
      <p>There’s no word on if or when we’ll see tablets with the new display. But it seems like TCL figures there’s a market for gaming tablets or it wouldn’t have made the display.</p>
