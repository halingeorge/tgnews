      <p>An estimated 35% of women have experienced some form of violence in their lifetimes, a statistic that few would not find alarming.</p>
      <p>But from France and Spain to Turkey, women are taking a stance against violence, protesting murder rates for women killed by an intimate partner and a lack of resources for victims.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25, Euronews journalists spoke about how the issue has resonated in their countries.</p>
      <p>According to the United Nations, 58% per cent of the 87,000 women murdered in 2017 were killed by intimate partners or family members.</p>
      <p>More than a third of women intentionally killed were killed by a former or current intimate partner.</p>
      <p>Euronews will be covering the topics of violence against women and domestic violence in a series of articles this week.</p>
