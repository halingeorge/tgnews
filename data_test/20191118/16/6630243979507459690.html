      <p>In his opening speech, H.E. Majid Saif Al Ghurair highlighted the long-established UAE-African relations in all fields, and Dubai’s status as Africa’s gateway to new markets building on its strong presence on the global economy map and its role in advancing international trade.</p>

      <p>“With the support of H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the forum has seen considerable growth in terms of significance and number of participants, bringing together heads of state, policymakers and business leaders to identify exciting business prospects emerging across the continent,” Al Ghurair said.</p>
      <p>“The African market is a market of strategic importance to Dubai and a key focus of Dubai Chamber’s expansion strategy and we are closely monitoring developments and the business climate in Africa to identify growth opportunities available for our members,” Al Ghurair explained.</p>
      <p>He furthere underlined the huge potential to boost UAE-Africa trade and investment flows following the launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) earlier this year.</p>
