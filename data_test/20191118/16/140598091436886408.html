      <h1>Wolf Pack rapists on trial in separate case of groping unconscious woman in car</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:21:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/james-badcock/" target="_blank">James Badcock</a></address>
      <p>Four of the five members of the so-called <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/06/21/spanish-wolfpack-jailed-rape-controversial-sexual-assault-conviction/">‘Wolf Pack’,</a> who are serving 15-year sentences for a gang rape during Pamplona’s San Fermín bull-running festival, have been put on trial for a different instance of sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>Spain’s public prosecution office has asked for jail terms of seven years for the men on charges of abuse and invasion of privacy after a video emerged of the four taking turns to grope and kiss a young woman in a completely unresponsive state.</p>
      <p>According to the accusation compiled by the investigating judge who ordered that the four men stand trial, Alfonso Jesús Cabezuelo, José Ángel Prenda, Antonio Manuel Guerrero and Jesús Escudero met the alleged victim at a village fair in the province of Córdoba, offering to give her a lift home.</p>
      <p>“As soon as she got in and sat in the front passenger seat, she fell into a state of deep unconsciousness,” the investigation read.</p>
      <p>“They all touched her breasts and [Cabezuelo] kissed her on the mouth as they all laughed at the victim.”</p>

      <p>According to the investigating judge, the woman woke up completely naked in the back of the car, with holes ripped in her clothes and bruises on the back of her legs. </p>
      <p>The woman, who is due to give evidence on Tuesday, has told police she remembers nothing of the car journey, leading investigators to suspect she was drugged. </p>
      <p>Cabezuelo, a former soldier, was the only person she recalls still being in the car. He is also accused of hitting the woman when she refused his request for a sex act. </p>
      <p>The Pamplona case caused controversy in Spain when the five men were initially cleared of rape and convicted of the lesser crime of sexual abuse, because they had not used violence or intimidation when having non-consensual sex with the victim. </p>
      <p>On a final appeal, it was ruled that they had created an “atmosphere of intimidation” that warranted a rape conviction.</p>
      <p>There is no evidence of whether the latest alleged victim was raped or, if so, how many times and by which of the men.</p>
      <p>She reported the incident after police came across the videos on the accused’s phones when investigating the San Fermín case.</p>
      <p>The four accused pleaded innocent and said they will remain silent during the trial. The defence asked for the video evidence to be discounted as it arose in the course of a separate investigation. </p>
