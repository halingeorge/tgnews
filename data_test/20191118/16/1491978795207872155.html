      <p>Ferrari will launch an investigation into the conduct of their drivers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and Charles Leclerc after they clashed with one another on track at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Both drivers were eliminated from the race as a result and Ferrari’s team principal, Mattia Binotto, has said they will be expected to explain themselves at the team’s headquarters in Maranello.</p>
      <p>“What’s going to be important with both drivers is to understand together at Maranello what happened and what has been the mistake,” said Binotto. “It is not for me to blame them, it’s for them to recognise it.”</p>
      <p>Vying for fourth place with five laps remaining, Vettel and Leclerc were on course for a solid result. Leclerc overtook Vettel through turn one and when the German came back at him they touched. Vettel received a puncture and Leclerc a broken front wheel and suspension. Both drivers believed they were not at fault, though neither took part in their usual post-race media meeting with the press.</p>
      <p>It is the first time they have hit one another this season and Binotto was adamant the crash would be investigated in full in order that it should not be repeated. “When doing things in the heat of the moment, you can come to the wrong conclusion,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I have heard from both drivers, but I will meet with them to discuss what happened. There will be time for the team to analyse the video and data. It is not a matter of fining or blaming. We let them race, but being free to fight doesn’t mean they should make silly mistakes. In truth, this sort of thing should never happen.” The stewards investigated the incident but determined that both drivers could have avoided the clash and so imposed no penalty.</p>

      <p>The crash adds pressure to an increasingly testing relationship between the two teammates. Leclerc has outperformed Vettel this season with seven wins and two poles. In Monza he defied a pre-qualifying plan by the team that cost Vettel and at Russia Vettel ignored a similar re-race team agreement and then team orders, to Leclerc’s displeasure.</p>
      <p>Mercedes have already clinched both the driver’s and constructor’s titles and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ferrari">Ferrari</a> are looking toward next season when managing their drivers will be vital. This year the team was clear from the off that they would favour four-time champion Vettel over Leclerc. However, the Monégasque’s performances this year have made such a clear distinction in 2020 highly unlikely. Binotto acknowledged that he would use the events at Brazil to help define the likely way their relationship will be handled, which will be no easy task if they are in the title fight.</p>
      <p>“Currently they’ve got a good relationship and they’re going well together,” he said. “Certainly what happened today may not help but I don’t think there is a drama at all. I see that more as an opportunity in the view of next year to clarify if needed.”</p>
      <p>Leclerc, currently in fourth place behind Verstappen, leads Vettel by 19 points in the world championship. He will beat the German if he finishes higher than seventh at the last round in Abu Dhabi. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won what was a chaotic race from pole position.</p>
