      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:02:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:02</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, Josh Challies, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>With the January transfer window closing in, we take a look at all the latest gossip surrounding Wolverhampton Wanderers and what else is going on in the Premier League and Championship.</p>
      <h4>'Closing in'</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> are closing in on an agreement for Royal Antwerp bull-back Aurelio Buta, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been linked with a number of top flight clubs, including Newcastle United and Watford after an impressive season in Belgium.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mirror (via The Express) have claimed that Wolves are close to finalising a deal that will see him move to Molineux, initially on loan.</p>
      <p>Buta is seen as vital competition for Matt Doherty, with Adama Traore now being utilised in a more traditional attacking role.</p>
      <p>Wolves have been extensively scouting the Portuguese star, who joined Antwerp from Benfica and it is understood that any temporary deal would be with a view to a permanent one down the line.</p>

      <h4>Manchester United target Reading striker</h4>
      <p>Manchester United are among several Premier League clubs considering a move for Reading’s 20-year-old striker Danny Loader, Sky Sports News report.</p>
      <p>The forward, who saw a Deadline Day move to join Wolves fall through last summer, is out of contract at the end of the season and the report adds that talks on a renewal with the Royals have stalled.</p>
      <p>As such, a move in January is heavily tipped to go ahead in order for Reading to receive a higher fee for his services.</p>

      <h4>Chelsea join Liverpool and United in chase for Wigan talent</h4>
      <p>Chelsea have joined Liverpool and Manchester United in the hunt for Wigan Athletic starlet Joe Gelhardt, reports from the Daily Star state.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has appeared seven times off the bench for the Championship strugglers and his emergence has caught the eye of a number of top-flight clubs ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The report adds that Manchester City, Tottenham and Everton have also been monitoring Gelhardt’s meteoric rise.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Michael O’Neill identifies Stoke City striker target</h4>
      <p>Michael O’Neill is looking to bolster Stoke City’s attack with the signing of Aberdeen striker Sam Cosgrove, according to Sunday’s print edition of the Sun.</p>
      <p>The former Everton youngster has struck 16 goals already this season and fired 21 goals for Aberdeen last season, establishing himself as one of the most prolific goalscorers in British football.</p>
      <p>O’Neill, who will take charge of the Potters for the first time against Wigan this weekend, has now identified the 22-year-old as the ideal candidate to improve his attacking options.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Leeds United reignite David Stockdale interest</h4>
      <p>Leeds United have revived their interest in Birmingham City goalkeeper David Stockdale, according to the Sunday People.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s side drafted in Kiko Casilla last January but could be forced into the market due to the Spaniard’s potential ban for racial abuse, with loanee Illan Meslier lacking experience.</p>
      <p>As such, the report claims that 34-year-old Stockdale, a boyhood fan of the club, is being considered as a January target after previously being linked with the club back in 2018.</p>
