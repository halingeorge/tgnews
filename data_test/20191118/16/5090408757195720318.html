      <p>Saudi Aramco has canceled its London roadshow a day after scrapping Asian and American ones, meaning its IPO is set to be a Saudi-only affair, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-17/aramco-seeks-1-71-trillion-valuation-in-world-s-biggest-ipo?srnd=premium">Bloomberg</a> and the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a83add8a-09ec-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">Financial Times.</a></p>
      <p>It will now only market shares of the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/saudi-aramco-most-profitable-company-earns-68-billion-nine-months-2019-10-1028639655">most profitable company</a> in the world to local investors within the Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The state-owned oil giant released its prospectus on Sunday, stating the company will list 1.5% of its shares on the local Tadawul exchange in Riyadh, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-aramco-sets-range-ahead-of-ipo-tracking-for-record-2019-11?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">seeking a valuation of roughly $1.7 trillion.</a></p>
      <p>The $1.7 trillion figure would make Aramco the highest-valued public company in the world, with a much larger market capitalization than Apple. However, it is well below the $2 trillion Saudi officials previously targeted, marking a setback for Mohammad bin Salman, the country’s crown prince.</p>
      <p>Last week, ex-CIA chief David Petraeus told CNBC in an interview that <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/saudi-running-out-of-money-needs-aramco-ipo-to-succeed-david-petraeus-2019-11-1028689071">Saudi Arabia was running out of money</a> to finance its Vision 2030 plan. Aramco’s mammoth IPO was expected to provide fresh funding, so the relatively lackluster valuation could hamper efforts to shift the economy away from oil.</p>
      <p>Saudi officials were reportedly <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/saudi-aramco-ipo-kingdom-negotiating-participation-from-billionaires-2019-11-1028673598">seeking out the country’s billionaires to buy huge portions of the stock</a> when it goes public.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia – the de facto leader of oil cartel OPEC – <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/saudi-wants-opec-to-drive-up-oil-prices-before-aramco-ipo-wsj-report-2019-11-1028665489">was pressing other members to cut oil production in the run-up to Aramco going public</a>, to try and ensure the IPO succeeded.</p>
      <p>The Financial Times also reported Saudi Aramco’s shares will be priced on December 5, with the IPO a week later.</p>
      <p>The newspaper added that Saudi is looking to sell 1 billion shares of the company to “local retail shareholders” with a bonus share scheme if they hold on to the stock for a given period.</p>
