      <h1>WeWork could lay off thousands as turmoil grows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:10:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Manskar</a></address>
      <p>WeWork could soon lay off at least 4,000 employees as the beleaguered office giant grapples with massive financial losses, a new report said.</p>
      <p>The bloodletting could see up to 2,500 people cut from WeWork’s core office subleasing business, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/wework-layoffs.html">the New York Times reported</a> Sunday. Another 1,000 people reportedly would be axed as WeWork winds down its Manhattan private school and other offshoots, and about 1,000 maintenance workers would move to an outside contractor.</p>
      <p>The planned cuts, which could affect as many as 6,000 workers, are part of a plan to revamp the struggling company over five years that may be presented to employees as soon as Tuesday, according to the Times.</p>
      <p>The specter of mass layoffs looms less than a week after reports that WeWork lost $1.25 billion in the quarter that ended in September as the company opened nearly 100 new locations across the world.</p>
      <p>The cutbacks are being planned as SoftBank, the Japanese investment firm that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/22/wework-accepts-softbanks-takeover-plan/">bailed out WeWork last month</a>, tries to stabilize the floundering business, the Times reported.</p>
      <p>The report that about a third of WeWork’s staff could soon be out of a job marks a stark contrast to the $1.7 billion package its co-founder and ex-CEO Adam Neumann received when he agreed to walk away from the firm last month.</p>
      <p>WeWork was reportedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/wework-in-talks-to-hire-t-mobiles-john-legere/">courting T-Mobile CEO John Legere,</a> another unconventional long-haired executive, to replace Neumann. Legere <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-is-stepping-down/">announced plans</a> to leave his current company, which is merging with Sprint, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/john-legere-isnt-leaving-t-mobile-to-take-wework-ceo-job.html">CNBC reported</a> Friday.</p>
