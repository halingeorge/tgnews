      <p>However, while it may appear to be a chocoholic's dream, fans have labelled the product a "rip off".</p>
      <p>"It'd be cheaper to buy all the chocolates separately &amp; make the box yourself," said one shopper.</p>

      <p>Another added: "Could make it myself for £25 and even have chocolate left over to do a smaller one."</p>

      <p>They said: "This year's Cadbury Ultimate Selection Box is a chocolate lover's dream, not only including 26 of our most loved bars, but also two children's tickets to the home of Cadbury chocolate – Cadbury World in Bournville."</p>
      <p>They added: "These tickets retail at £12.85 each, so we think at £45 the Ultimate Selection Box is great value for money and a fantastic festive gift to share with family and friends this Christmas."</p>
      <p>Some backed the chocolate giant, though, and said it was a fair price for the sweet treats and the day out tickets.</p>
