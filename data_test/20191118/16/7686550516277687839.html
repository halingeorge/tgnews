      <p>Temperatures across the UK are set to drop below zero tonight as home across the UK crank up the heating.</p>
      <p>The Met Office has issued a weather warning for some of the UK, stretching from Liverpool and Manchester in the north through the Midlands and down to London and the South Coast.</p>
      <p>It says dense fog and freezing fog patches will hit the UK between 4am and 11am on Tuesday and this could see temperatures plunging.</p>
      <p>Homes across the UK will be switching on heating and that means bills are about to rise as we enter the winter months.</p>
      <p>However, a business that starred on BBC's Dragon's Den says it can save users £250 on heating bills in seconds - and is also giving away a £20 Amazon gift card to anybody who signs up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/31CNtax">Look After My Bills</a> was a startup that appeared on BBC's Dragons' Den and secured funding from all five dragons and it has made big promises when it comes to reducing heating bills.</p>
      <p>By signing up to the site they will automatically monitor energy companies and switch you to the best supplier without you having to do a thing. It says it can save up to £253 per year by using the free service and you can sign up even if your contract is not yet up.</p>
      <p>You can <a href="https://fave.co/31CNtax">sign up</a> even if your deal has not ended and there are no hidden costs - the site earns money by being payed commission by the energy companies.</p>
      <p>For a short time only it is giving away Amazon gift cards to any new sign ups.</p>
      <p>However, it is not the only way to save money on energy bills. If you do not want to use Look After My Bills you can switch your supplier manually.</p>
      <p>If you don’t take action when they expire, you’ll automatically be moved on to your company’s standard, default or temporary tariff. This is unlikely to be its cheapest deal. It is possible to save up to £169 per year by switching from the priciest Big Six standard default tariff on the market to the cheapest available deal.</p>
      <p>The savings used to be greater – closer to £300 – before the introduction of a price cap on standard and default energy deals from 1st January 2019.</p>
      <p>You can switch by contacting your supplier or using a switching service such as <a href="https://fave.co/2Ky2jZs">USwitch</a> .</p>
