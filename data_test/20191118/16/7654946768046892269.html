      <h1>Devils waive Cory Schneider amid continuous struggles</h1>

      <p>Cory Schneider’s spot on the Devils’ NHL roster became untenable.</p>
      <p>The veteran goaltender will be placed on waivers Monday at noon, the team announced, the culmination of several injury-plagued seasons and a vast decline in performance. He’ll be assigned to AHL Binghamton if he clears waivers as expected.</p>
      <p>Schneider, 33, has a 4.59 goals against average and .852 save percentage in six starts this season. The Devils are 0-4-2 in those six games. He’s under contract through the 2021-22 season with a $6 million cap hit per year. Schneider would still carry a $4,925,000 cap hit if his contract is buried in the minors.</p>
      <p>After being acquired from the Canucks before the 2013-14 season, Schneider split goaltending duties with Martin Brodeur before taking over for the Devils legend the following season. After an excellent first few seasons in Newark, he has a 3.12 GAA and .901 save percentage in 72 regular-season appearances over the last three years, including this season.</p>
      <p>Mackenzie Blackwood, 22, has drawn most of the starts this season for the Devils, putting up a 2.79 GAA and .904 save percentage in 14 games (13 starts).</p>
      <p>In a corresponding move with Schneider being waived, the Devils called up 27-year-old Louis Domingue from Binghamton to serve as Blackwood’s new backup.</p>
