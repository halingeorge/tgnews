      <h1>World Cup qualifiers | A struggling India finds itself in a do-or-die situation against Oman</h1>
      <h2>Faces Oman in a World Cup qualifying round away match</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:54:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Winless in four games so far in an increasingly disappointing campaign, the Indian football team faces higher-ranked Oman in a do-or-die World Cup qualifying round match here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A first half strike from Sunil Chhetri gave India hopes of beating Oman in the first leg in Guwahati in September but it ultimately turned out to be so-near-yet-so-far as the Gulf nation struck twice in the final 10 minutes to outwit the home side.</p>
      <p>Oman is coming into this match after an emphatic (4-1) win over Bangladesh here on November 14.</p>
      <h3>Late equalisers</h3>
      <p>India, on the other hand, is struggling after an impressive goal-less draw against Asian champion Qatar as it needed late equalisers in its identical 1-1 draws against lower-ranked Bangladesh and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>After three draws and a defeat, India is fourth in the Group E table with three points while Oman is second with nine points from four matches. Qatar is on top with 10 points from four matches.</p>
      <p>An upset win over Oman will certainly keep Igor Stimac’s side in the hunt for a next round berth but a loss will virtually send India out of reckoning as far as the 2022 World Cup qualification is concerned.</p>
      <p>If India loses, it will trail Oman by nine points and has only three matches — maximum nine points — left to play in this second round of the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Even the runner-up sides from the eight groups are not guaranteed an automatic spot in the third round of the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>A draw against Oman will also make it difficult for India to qualify for the next round. Its last three matches — all to be played next year — are against Qatar (at home on March 26), Bangladesh (away, June 4) and Afghanistan (at home, June 9).</p>
      <p>But getting at least a point against Oman may prove crucial as it will make it easier for India to get an automatic third round berth for the 2023 Asian Cup qualifiers.</p>
      <p>This campaign is also a joint qualifying round for the 2023 Asian Cup and the third-placed teams and the best four fourth placed teams from the eight groups automatically get a spot in the third round of the qualifiers of the continental championships.</p>
      <h3>No attack or defence</h3>
      <p>Stimac’s side has struggled not just in defence but four matches into this campaign, it is also clear that its attack is also not in the best of form.</p>
      <p>India is no longer dependent on only Chhetri to score the goals but the inability to convert the chances has cost the team dear.</p>
      <p>Stimac has no illusion about who is the favourite on Tuesday but he is also hoping that his players will convert the chances which come their way and score goals.</p>
      <p>“Oman are much better now than the team we played against in Guwahati. They are the favourites. We know for a fact that match is going to be very difficult for us,” the high profile Croatian coach said.</p>
      <h3>Historical underdog</h3>
      <p>Historically too, India is the underdog, having not won any of the 11 matches it has played against Oman, which has emerged victorious on eight occasions.</p>
      <p>Before the Guwahati match in September, the two sides played out a 0-0 draw in the run-up to the 2019 Asian Cup in the UAE. In the two legs of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers played in 2015, India had lost to Oman 0-3 in Muscat before a 1-2 defeat in Bangalore.</p>
      <p>India welcomes the return of senior central defender Anas Edathodika after he missed the Afghanistan match due to a family emergency.</p>
      <p>India, however, will miss the services of Sandesh Jhingan, Rowling Borges and Amarjit Singh due to injuries.</p>
