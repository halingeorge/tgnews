      <h1>Lil Xan Claims He Suffered Seizures Trying to Quit Drugs Cold Turkey, Completely Sober Now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:59:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/cvernoncoleman/" target="_blank">C. Vernon Coleman II</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/lil-xan/">Lil Xan</a>'s <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/11/lil-xan-relapsed-sobriety/">struggle with drug addiction</a> has been a reoccurring theme. Now the rapper claims he is completely sober following a fight to kick drugs cold turkey that had ill effects on his body.</p>
      <p>On Monday (Nov. 18), <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/lil-xan-relapse-seizures-cold-turkey-lil-peep-death-anniversary/">TMZ</a> interviewed the rapper about his harrowing ordeal with trying to get sober.</p>
      <p>"You guys remember back when everyone was like, 'Oh, Diego's M.I.A. Where's Diego at' and stuff?" Xan asked. "I was in the hospital..because I stopped taking drugs...I went cold turkey 'cause I didn't want to be on drugs no more. But the withdrawals actually gave me seizures, you know what I mean? It was a wake-up call."</p>
      <p>He added, "They said it was from going cold turkey off Xanax. I wanted to stop drugs completely, but I did it the wrong way, you know. I did it cold turkey and I had a couple seizures. I tried to bullshit and say I was sick but I just wasn't ready until right now to let the world know. Yea, I'm completely sober now."</p>
      <p>He went on to say the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/11/lil-peep-dies-21/">overdose deaths of Lil Peep</a> and <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/09/mac-miller-dead-drug-overdose-26/">Mac Miller</a> were the main factors in him deciding to be drug free.</p>
      <p>Xan checked <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/12/lil-xan-checks-into-rehab/">himself into rehab </a>last December. After two weeks in the facility, he <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/12/lil-xan-checks-out-rehab-sober/">checked out</a> claiming to be clean. "Out And Sober 🙏🏼💔," he posted on social media.</p>
      <p>After relapsing again, it sounds like the rapper doing better.</p>

      <p>“We did this show in Atlanta on Ty [Dolla $ign]’s tour. We was all on the tour bus and it was a bunch of people I didn’t meet. Ty’s tour bus was like the fuckin’ Source Awards. But everybody was on there—Trouble, Migos, everybody. I’m going to introduce myself to everybody and everybody would be like, ‘Come on, dog, we know who you are. When we workin’? What we doin’?’ That was crazy, but I brought Jermaine [Dupri] out. I brought Hoodrich Pablo Juan out and he did a song; I brought [Lil] Scrappy out and he did 'Head Bussa.' And then I closed my set with Jermaine and he did 'Welcome to Atlanta' in Atlanta and the whole crowd went crazy. Like, no one really brings JD out to do that, so I’m thinking that’s Jay-Z level. That’s crazy. Do we have footage? I need that.”</p>

      <p>"I had a room, right? So I go in my hotel room and it was a girl that worked there. I don't know if she got drunk and got bold to do it, but when I go back in the room, she came out the drawer. She hid in my room until I got back and came out of the drawer. I think we were in Houston. I put her out—you gotta roll."</p>

      <p>“We were on the road with Dizzy Wright. I think it was like, Albuquerque, N.M. Or it might have been El Paso—one of those fuckin’ places. There were a bunch of fans arguing and screaming in the parking lot. Our security—his name is DJ—came and got me and was like, ‘Yo, you gotta check this out.’</p>
      <p>My first reaction is to jump in between them and try to make sure that everything’s cool, you know? Didn’t realize these kids were heavily gang-affiliated. You ever seen that movie, <i>Only the Strong</i>, where they sing, ‘Ba, na, na, weh,’ and they’re kinda stabbing at each other with knives and shit? It was some shit like that and I was in between them. They were trying to poke each other so I was like, ‘Y’all wanna keep having hip-hop shows? Y’all gotta stop this shit right now,’ so the crowd kinda dispersed. I foolishly thought it dispersed because I made an impact and I was like, 'Yeah, I fuckin’ killed this shit, brought the peace in.' Two seconds later, you hear tires screeching—one of the kids who was involved in the tussle, his peoples had pulled up. Crowd scatters. I’m not a street dude, like, fuck that shit. So I was like fuck it, I booked it to the merch, behind the merch truck. I was duckin’ and then the fighting still kept on going.</p>
      <p>Have you ever seen a hockey fight where they pull the shirt over? So these kids, one of them pulled the shirt over, he finally cut the other kid and he was just laying, bleeding in the parking lot. It was crazy. The police were on their own schedule. It was a good five, six minutes that passed. At a Dizzy Wright show, too. We’re like, peaceful; everybody’s chillin’.”</p>

      <p>"I was fuckin' performing and I just see something fly on the stage. This huge-ass item fly on the stage. Boom! I stopped the show. 'Yo, what the fuck? Who the fuck threw this shit on the stage?' I see a group of dudes ganged up in the corner. I'm like, 'Yo listen, I'ma fuck yall niggas up!' I continue the show, go home. I go in my Instagram messages, Some girl hits me up. She goes 'Did you get the cookie, filled with gelato, that I threw on the stage?' I'm like, 'Why would you throw some shit on the stage? You threw a cookie of all things. You had niggas in the crowd like, 'Ohhh,' why you do that shit?' I followed her right after though. We're friends now. I just hit her up the other day like, 'Yo, you good?'"</p>

A muhfucka just be [like], 'This my gal, you can have her tonight Ke!' I be like, 'Nah'. I'm scared of that move really—that's too strong right there. I don't want that one. As far as like an autograph, women take they bra off, took they titty out: 'I want it on here!' I be like damn! Boy, I've had some women go far. They'll say any goddamn thing."</p>

      <p>“A whole show getting shut down because I guess it was getting too crazy. They pepper sprayed everyone in the crowd. It was an all-ages show. I had to sneak everyone out the back; it was getting too wild and people were climbing on the stage. It was crazy. It was in [Greater] Sudbury, Canada.”</p>

      <p>"When I was in Sweden, I stayed an extra day to two days. We were like, 'Fuck it, I'ma just see how many fans I have out here.' I was like, 'Yo, meet me here.' About 80 kids pulled up to my hotel. They're waiting to just take a picture with me and then dip. Some stayed, brought me weed, smoked it with me."</p>
