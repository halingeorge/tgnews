      <h1>Nearly 20 percent of Japan households using e-money but cash still king</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:15:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">The Jakarta Post</a></address>
      <p>Almost a fifth of Japanese households use electronic money for small purchases, a survey by a central bank-affilated research institute showed, up from a year ago and a sign the country's cash-hoarding culture is changing.</p>
      <p>In the survey published on Monday and conducted between June and July, 18.5% of households said they use electronic money, such as smartphone apps and debit card payments, on shopping trips where 1,000 yen ($9.17) or less is spent, up from 15.4 percent in the previous year.</p>
      <p>Among single-person households - 43 percent of whom are in their 20s and 30s - the ratio was much higher at 35.6 percent, suggesting government efforts to prod Japanese to go cashless may be paying off, at least among the younger generation.</p>
      <p>Despite the growth in electronic payments, Japan's "cash-is-king" mentality remains entrenched with the survey showing 84% still use notes and coins for small purchases.</p>
      <p>And for payments exceeding 10,000 yen and up to 50,000 yen, 48.5 percent of households said they pay by cash and 3.4 percent by electronic money, the survey showed.</p>
      <p>A low crime rate, years of ultra-low interest rates and a nationwide network of automatic-teller machines (ATMs) have long made cash appealing in Japan, giving people few reasosn to shift to cashless payments.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pushing to make more Japanese switch to cashless payments to allow stores to automate sales estimates and banks to cut back on costly ATMs.</p>
      <p>Shoppers have recently been encouraged to ditch cash for e-money after the government introduced a rebate program to ease the pain of a sales tax hike on Oct. 1.</p>
