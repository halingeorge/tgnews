      <h1>'I thought I was a freak' - Inspirational South Shields man opens up about autism diagnosis</h1>
      <h2>Richard Smith has been praised for helping support young children with autism</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Nichol</a></address>
      <p>Beaten, neglected and feeling alone, Richard Smith hit rock bottom.</p>
      <p>For more than 20 years he hid his condition because he thought he was "weird".</p>
      <p>But at the age of 30, Richard was finally diagnosed with autism.</p>
      <p>Learning to live with his condition, Richard is now using his life experience to help stop other autistic children going through what he did.</p>
      <p>And as a result of his hard work, he has won the People’s Autism Hero Award at the Autism Hero Awards 2019.</p>

      <p>Born in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-shields">South Shields</a>, Richard grew up suffering from child abuse and neglect until he was two-and-half years old.</p>
      <p>After being reported to the police and social services, Richard’s birth parents were jailed and he was put into care.</p>
      <p>At the age of three Richard was adopted and was diagnosed with detachment disorder.</p>
      <p>Richard, known to many as Richie, said: "I never really gelled with my adopted parents, I felt very alone and I isolated myself to feel even more alone.</p>
      <p>"I was really unwell because of the way I was treated and never accepted why I was different to the world.</p>
      <p>"After realising I had sensory differences that I never knew I had, I bottled it all up which then caused me to become more detached from adoptive family."</p>
      <p>Struggling with his adoption, Richard never addressed these issues and kept hiding them away from others.</p>
      <p>Creating his own secret sensory box of household objects, he used to hide in the toilet seeing it as a 'safe place' from the world.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old said: "I would never be able to tell anybody about it because I thought I was a freak and a weirdo.</p>
      <p>"I felt almost like I used to put a show on to depress my autism."</p>

      <p>Richard struggled throughout school and after being told by teachers that he was "thick", "stupid" and "naughty" he left school without qualifications.</p>
      <p>He left home when he was 17 and despite trying to stay in touch with his adoptive family, he found himself drifting away before turning to gambling and attempting to take his own life.</p>
      <p>He met his wife in 2005 but by the time he was 25, his mother-in-law had told him he had to address his mental health issues.</p>
      <p>Richard sought medical help along with therapy and managed to find a place at Newcastle College studying a Level 3 course in engineering.</p>
      <p>He and his wife then adopted two children and Richard said he had turned his life around.</p>
      <p>However, Richard said that the staff pointed out his past to be his biggest strength as he is able to understand what the children are going through.</p>
      <p>He said: "My family are fantastic but at this stage in the back of my mind I still felt like a weirdo and different.</p>
      <p>"When we adopted our first child, my little one used to have a high pitched scream and it upset me as it was predictable.</p>
      <p>"I thought to myself why don't I sort this last piece of the puzzle out and go to the doctors and say that I can see a million of things and hearing noises without knowing why."</p>
      <p>He said: "I lost my mental health, I was looking online and attending different autism groups to get help.</p>
      <p>"Then it dawned on me that autism is different to everyone autistic, we are all different. Which made me then realise that I can be myself."</p>
      <p>In October, Richard quit his job as an engineering tutor and opened Awesometistic to help give autistic children a voice.</p>
      <p>He said: "I want no little boy or girl to grow up the way that I did.</p>
      <p>"Now I want to make sure make kids realise that people with autism are awesome and it's not something that they should be scared of.</p>
      <p>"I was always scared to have a voice and voice myself in case of peoples opinion but now I carry my own sensory box with me."</p>

      <p>Now, Richard goes into hundreds of school across the North East sharing his story about autism, to try to teach children, staff and parents how autism is different to every individual.</p>
      <p>While giving talks at autistic events and setting up his own parent's support group, he has helped more than 2,500 families with autistic children.</p>
      <p>Richard attends the events in his Ford Mustang, which was donated by car dealership <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lookers">Lookers</a>, and he said he receives an impressive reaction from children helping to promote that ‘even having autism you can be awesome’.</p>
      <p>As a result of his hard work, Richard recently won the People’s Autism Hero Award at the Autism Hero Awards in London.</p>
      <p>He said: "My life experiences have made me stronger and who I am today.</p>
      <p>"I started to cry and overwhelmed. I had such a lovely night.</p>
      <p>"A year ago I would never expect to be in London receiving an award."</p>
