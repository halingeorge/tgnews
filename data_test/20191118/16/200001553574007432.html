      <h1>Arsenal player has ‘again’ offered himself to another club – They’ve politely declined for now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:37:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Mohamed Elneny is very keen on signing for AC Milan, if Italy’s <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/elneny-si-offre-di-nuovo-al-milan-19340">Calciomercato</a> are correct.</p>
      <p>It’s reported the Arsenal player, currently on loan in Turkey with Besiktas, has ‘again’ offered himself to the Serie A side.</p>
      <p>Elneny would like to return to playing in a bigger European league, and has seemingly picked out Milan as his preferred destination. The offer was made via the midfielder’s entourage, and it’s explained that it was politely declined… at least for now.</p>
      <p>Whilst it’s thought it would be relatively easy to cancel the loan with Besiktas, Milan would then want to loan the player themselves and negotiate a buying option with Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The Rossoneri don’t want to take on players and then have no control over their future.</p>
      <p>Even if all of that could be arranged, Elneny isn’t near the top of Milan’s midfield wish-list, with Granit Xhaka being one of the players ahead of him.</p>
      <p>Whilst there’s no serious interest now, it’s not ruled out that the possibility could be considered if other moves fail, and Elneny is seen as a ‘market opportunity’.</p>
