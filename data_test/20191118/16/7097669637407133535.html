      <h1>Shooting in Walmart parking lot leaves three dead in Oklahoma</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:28:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.reuters.com/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - Three people died in a shooting outside a Walmart store in Oklahoma on Monday morning, law enforcement officials said, the third fatal shooting at the retailer in five months and the latest in a string of gun violence across the United States.</p>
      <p>Video of the scene showed heavy police presence around a car riddled with bullet holes in the Walmart parking lot in Duncan, Oklahoma. A white sheet, covering what appeared to be a body, was laid next to it, with blood stains visible on the ground.</p>
      <p>The bodies of one woman and one man were found inside the car, with another dead man found outside the car, the Duncan Police Department said on Facebook. A handgun was found on the scene, police said.</p>
      <p>The shooter was among the dead, the Duncan Banner newspaper reported citing police.</p>
      <p>Duncan is a town of roughly 22,000 people located about 80 miles (129 km) south of Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>The incident came the day after another shooting in Fresno, California, that saw at least four killed as people gathered in a backyard to watch a football game, with at least one shooter still unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>California was also hit by a school shooting in Santa Clarita last week in which a 16-year-old boy shot and killed two classmates before turning the gun on himself, and a San Diego shooting on Saturday that saw a man kill his estranged wife and three of their young sons before killing himself.</p>
      <p>In August, a man killed 22 people at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart and injured 26 others. He is accused of deliberately targeting Mexicans and has pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>In July, a Walmart employee killed two co-workers and injured a police officer.</p>
      <p>Walmart reassessed the security of its stores, adding third-party security or uniformed off-duty police officers at times, following the El Paso shooting and another at a Mississippi Walmart in which an employee shot and killed two colleagues.</p>
      <p>In September, following the El Paso shooting, the company said it would no longer sell .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber ammunition that is often used the sort of rifles with large-capacity clips that have been a major factor in some of the nation's deadliest mass shootings.</p>
      <p>Walmart also stopped selling handgun ammunition and AR-15 and other military-style rifles.</p>
      <p>The store also asked its customers to no longer openly carry weapons into their stores in states that allow the open carrying of firearms.</p>
