      <h2>The "cute and cuddly" team didn't work. All you have to do is ask for a fast bike, as if the opponents had perfect ones. Quartararo has shown Yamaha that many problems magically disappear by opening the throttle, and Ducati must take note.</h2>

      <p><b>We want them bad, we want them a bit ignorant, we want them politically incorrect. We want them to be successful. </b>The <i>"cute and cuddly" team -</i> a fan's definition that we read on the web and loved - that Ducati put on the track this year did not work. The reason is nothing new<b>: the best teams have always been those with two riders who hate</b> <b>each other</b>, not those where they're all love and peace.</p>
      <p>The "family" team is an invention of our times, where it's legitimate to pretend, and showing your true feelings is a sin.</p>
      <p><b>Prost and Senna hated each other, and Agostini and Read were no exception. </b>Rainey couldn't stand Kocinski and, not surprisingly,<b> the best season for Borgo Panigale was last year, when Dovi visibly couldn't tolerate the real Lorenzo</b>, not the one who applauded him under the podium the year before.</p>
      <p><b>And if the goal is the world championship, even if it might seem ugly, hierarchies must be established</b>. <b>Rainey </b>was pissed off when <b>Luca Cadalora</b> stole his victory from him at Donington in 1993, and <b>Kenny Roberts</b> treated <b>Eddie Lawson</b> badly when he didn't have his back against <b>Freddie Spencer</b> at Imola in 1983.</p>
      <p>If <b>Andrea Dovizioso's first second place behind Marquez in 2017 was a result</b> and the second year, last year, confirms that Ducati could win back a title that they haven't had since 2007,<b> the third, this year, is simply a bitter and atrocious defeat.</b></p>
      <p>Marc was a steamroller, that's true. He never did worse than second place. He stopped only once - it wasn't his fault - but <b>Rins</b>,<b> Vinales, and Petrucci also won</b>. A total of four Grand Prixs. So <b>Marc is magical, but not unbeatable</b>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the teams with two champions must be managed with authority, not through ignorance nor through fence-sitting. And if you know you <b>have two numbers, one on the team is not a disaster.</b> It's a choice, and you have to behave accordingly.</p>

      <p>So, <b>only one boss at the head of everything.</b> Duties and honors. One word, one face. Today we saw <b>Gigi Dall'Igna give Jorge Lorenzo a sincere hug</b> when he returned to the garage. He never doubted that he had a Champion - not just a good rider - in his hands.</p>
      <p>Well, you know what I mean<b>. We didn't like Ducati's policy this year</b> and, frankly, considering a possible "team title" as a result, was ridiculous. As if preventing Honda from conquering the "triple crown" (which doesn't mean squat, let's face it) were something that could give them a bit of satisfaction.</p>
      <p>We're serious.<b> Sports, any type of sports, is oppression in white gloves</b> and, of course, there is a whole series of correct rules to respect. It's a war that they must learn to lose in style.</p>
      <p><b>This year, Fabio Quartararo reminded Yamaha tha,t in motorcycling, the rider still counts more than the bike</b>. He eliminated any type of excuse for Rossi and Vinales. Ducati should take advantage of this reality.</p>
