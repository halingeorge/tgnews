      <p>No <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/the-best-christmas-afternoon-teas-to-try-in-london-11171841/">Christmas</a> would be complete without a stocking on the wall, and one company has brought back an adult-only product for 2019.</p>
      <p>The piece in question: a stocking which dispenses booze.</p>
      <p>Now that’s what we call a stocking filler.</p>
      <p>Party Flasks is the company behind this genius invention, which is aptly named Santa’s Flask.</p>
      <p>The product can hold up to 2.25 litres of your favourite festive tipple – which equates to around three bottles of wine.</p>
      <p>Its features include a wide mouth (which makes it easy to fill), alongside a leak-proof spout – to prevent any wastage.</p>

      <p>The opening is also wide enough to fit ice cubes inside – should your drink require it.</p>
      <p>It’s reusable, too – so will come in handy for pleasing families and friends, year after year.</p>
      <p>According to the website, the boozy treat is made from ‘BPA-free and FDA approved food grade plastic’ – so it’s lightweight and perfectly safe to drink from.</p>

      <p>The imaginative product is being sold on gifting website <a href="https://www.coolstuff.com/Santas-Flask">CoolStuff, for £16.99</a> – a pretty reasonable price considering its reusable nature.</p>

      <p>Stockings and booze are a Christmas match made in heaven, so it’s hardly a surprise that the product has received glowing five-star reviews on Amazon. Although, it is currently out of stock on the online marketplace.</p>
      <p>One individual said: ‘Got this as a gift for my mother on her boat and she loved it. It gets used quite a lot and not just during the holidays. It’s a conversation piece for sure and gets a lot of laughs.’</p>
      <p>While another added: ‘My son-in-love hinted strongly for this “stocking”, so I got it for him. It was a big hit. I will be putting his name on it and using it over and over again. Easy to fill, easy to clean.’</p>
      <p>Another Amazon seller <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stocking-Wine-Dispenser-Flask-2-0/dp/B076Y4YK5V">Fairly Odd Novelties</a> is also offering a similar product for £9.95 – this one holds just under two litres of liquid.</p>
      <p>Our advice is to stock up now, before the office Christmas party.</p>
