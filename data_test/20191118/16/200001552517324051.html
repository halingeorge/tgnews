      <h1>Club keen on signing Southampton player – Could be huge financial loss for Saints</h1>

      <p>When Southampton signed Guido Carrillo from a reported £19m in January 2018 it looked like an overpriced deal.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pellegrino wanted the signing, and the Saints backed their manager and sent the money to a very grateful AS Monaco. Less than two months later, the coach was sacked and there was no place for Carrillo at the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>Pellegrino took over at Leganes and loaned the striker in the following summer window, the loan was repeated again the following summer. Things quickly turned sour and the manager parted with the club in October.</p>
      <p>Now Carrillo again finds himself without the manager who trusts him, and with a very uncertain future. He’s failed to score a goal so far this season and the chances of Leganes wanting a permanent deal with Southampton are remote.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend reports came from the player’s native Argentina of interest from Mexican side Cruz Azul. Contact has already been made, according to the claims, with <a href="https://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/fut-al-horno/cruz-azul-mano-fichar-argentino-guido-carrillo">Medio Tiempo</a> saying the story started with Radio del Plata.</p>
      <p>It could present a chance for both Leganes and Southampton to see the back of the 28 year old, but that’s likely to be at a huge loss for the Saints.</p>
