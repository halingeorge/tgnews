      <p>Before Slack and Trello, the online newsrooms I worked in used Basecamp and Campfire to keep projects organised. When it comes to personal projects, however, Basecamp’s price tag of $US99 ($145)/mo has made it a no-go. That is until now. This week the company launched a free tier that gives you a lot of the same functionality of traditional Basecamp without the costly monthly commitment.</p>
      <p>Called <a href="https://basecamp.com/personal">Basecamp Personal</a>, the company says that it was created “specifically for freelancers, students, families, and personal projects.” You know, those things that you’re organising for just yourself or a small group of people like your family or a group of friends, not an entire corporate office. It previously <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/01/basecamp-personal-manages-your-non-work-projects">offered a Personal tier for $US25 ($37)/project</a>, but this version is entirely free.</p>
      <p>Within Basecamp Personal you can have up to three projects going at once and have up to 19 other people working with you on those projects. Within the project files, you’re allowed to store up to 1GB of data. It’s not going to work for larger business projects, but for small businesses and personal stuff, it could be perfect.</p>
      <p>You don’t need a credit card to sign up, and you can walk away at any point if you decide it’s not for you.</p>
      <p>Basecamp can be a great tool when you’re working on projects with lots of moving parts and want to see where each person in your “team” is on those parts at any given moment. Here’s a rundown of some of the features:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s something I always enjoyed using and can help keep even the most complicated of projects organised. More importantly, it can cut down on the exchange of thousands of organizational emails when you’re working on a larger project. That is, provided you can get everyone working on your project on-board.</p>
      <p>If you’ve been trying the free tier of Trello or something else and it’s not quite getting the job done, it’s worth taking a look at the free tier of Basecamp to see if it might be a bit better for your needs.</p>
