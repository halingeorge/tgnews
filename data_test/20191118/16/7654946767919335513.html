      <p>The US Supreme Court told “Pharma Bro” to take a hike Monday.</p>
      <p>Manhattan fraudster and disgraced former drug company honcho Martin Shkreli had appealed his conviction to the country’s highest court, arguing that the instructions to the jury at his trial were confusing, <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/470894-supreme-court-denies-martin-shkreli-appeal-of-fraud-conviction">according to The Hill</a>.</p>
      <p>Shkreli is doing seven years behind bars for securities fraud <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/08/04/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-convicted-in-fraud-trial/">for lying to investors</a> about the performance of two companies he ran.</p>
      <p>The top court refused to consider his alleged grounds for appeal. A lower appeals court had already upheld the sentence, plus a $7.4 million fine against Shkreli.</p>
