      <p>TORONTO — NHL commissioner Gary Bettman says Sportsnet broadcaster Ron MacLean "spoke from the heart" during his monologue on "Hockey Night in Canada" over the weekend.</p>
      <p>MacLean opened the first intermission segment on Saturday night — the first since Cherry was fired last week — by speaking alone on camera for nearly five minutes.</p>
      <p>Bettman, a panellist at today's PrimeTime sports management conference in downtown Toronto, says MacLean "obviously made his feelings clear."</p>
      <p>Bettman declined to weigh in on Cherry's departure, saying he's not going to start another news cycle.</p>
      <p>Cherry used the phrase, "You people," during the "Coach's Corner'' segment on Nov. 9 but later denied that he was singling out visible minorities.</p>
      <p>MacLean, who apologized the day after, talked at length about his close relationship with Cherry but said he had to choose "principle over friendship," adding "Coach's Corner is no more."</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 18, 2019.</p>
