      <h1>Andi Peters takes the mick out of himself as he addresses Ant and Dec jibe</h1>
      <h2>Dec cheekily imitated the presenter during last night's I'm A Celebrity</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:07:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:07</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>It seems Andi Peters took Ant and Dec’s joke about him on last night’s <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> with good grace - and even admitted earlier today he had been "excited" to be mentioned on the ITV reality show.</p>
      <p>TV presenter Andi, 49, also sent himself up in a similar manner to Dec’s perceived impersonation of him when he presented his regular competition slot on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/lorraine/">Lorraine</a> this morning.</p>
      <p>The Geordie pair appeared to take a dig at the former BBC broom cupboard fave as they bantered about telly contests featuring keen as mustard hosts.</p>
      <p>Referring to scenes that had just been shown of the celebrity contestants aboard a big boat, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec</a> reflected: "I was thinking, isn't it nice to see a daytime TV presenter standing on a luxury yacht without hearing the words: 'You and a friend could win £50,000 for life'."</p>

      <p>He then did a little twirl on the spot as he pointed his finger in the air.</p>
      <p>"Good Andi Peters impression," <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant</a> obeserved.</p>
      <aside>I don’t think anyone notices what I do, except Dec Donnelly!</aside>
      <p>But Dec played ignorant, responding: "Who?"</p>
      <p>Speaking from Copenhagen this morning, Andi seemed to see the funny side of the swipe.</p>

      <p>"I was so excited Lorraine!" he said.</p>
      <p>Andi continued: "Let's be honest, I don’t think anyone notices what I do, except Dec Donnelly!"</p>
      <p>He also mimicked Dec’s showbiz spin as he presented his own segment, holding a finger aloft.</p>
      <p>It seems apparent there is no bad blood between Andi and the lads, especially after Dec apologised on Twitter after the show.</p>
      <p>Pretending to correct Dec, Andi tweeted: "I think you’ll find it’s £100k, in time for Christmas! @antanddec @itv @imacelebrity #ImACeleb #youvegottobeinittowinit."</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec’s joint account responded: "I stand corrected! Soz Andi! D x."</p>
