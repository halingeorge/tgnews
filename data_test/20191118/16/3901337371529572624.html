      <p>The Black Stars defeated the hosts on the artificial pitch at the Estadio Nacional 12 de Julho 1-0 courtesy of a second-half penalty by Jordan Ayew.</p>
      <p>The early stages of the game were dominated by the visitors, although they struggled to create clear-cut opportunities despite making just one change to the team that secured a 2-0 victory over South Africa last Thursday.</p>
      <p>One of the few chances fell to Andre Ayew, but his header sailed over the bar in the 20th minute.</p>
      <p>Sao Tome had a decent chance just before half-time following some miscommunication between a Ghana defender and goalkeeper Richard Ofori, but the shot-stopper managed to keep things level.</p>
      <p>The teams headed into the break with the score tied at 0-0, with Ghana ending the first half with 78% possession without finding the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Thomas Partey had a great chance just after half-time, but placed his header just over the bar.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ayew eventually opened the scoreline, converting a spot-kick in the 50th minute after Sao Tome's goalkeeper brought down Emmanuel Boateng inside the box.</p>
      <p>The hosts came close to scoring in the 70th minute, but the bicycle-kick effort sailed just wide.</p>
      <p>The score remained 1-0 at the final whistle, which saw Ghana go three points clear at the top of Group C after collecting their second victory in a row.</p>
