      <h2>Expert who collected defibrillators for patients in Ghana is among winners at glittering ceremony.</h2>

      <p>DEVOTED medic Julius Donkor, who has made a life-saving difference to hundreds of patients, was among the NHS heroes to be honoured at the Scottish Health Awards.</p>
      <p>A cardiac physiologist at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Julius was the inaugural winner of the Global Citizenship Award for his tireless efforts to collect expired medical equipment to send to hospitals his native Ghana.</p>
      <p>The awards, now in their 18th year, took place at Edinburgh Corn Exchange on Thursday and once again shone a spotlight on the individuals and teams who make it their life mission to deliver high-quality health and social care.</p>
      <p>Julius, of NHS Grampian, was prompted to take action after visiting family in Ghana and noticing that many hospitals in the country did not have defibrillators. Now he has collected more than 100 of the life-saving devices and delivered them to the African nation.</p>
      <p>Julius said: “Defibrillators have made a huge difference in Ghana, they are saving lives.</p>
      <p>“My grandmother started this. She is the one who inspired this about five or six years ago when she fell ill in Ghana and my exposure there is what made me want to help in their hospitals.”</p>

      <p>Trophies at the annual awards ceremony, which is run by the Daily Record in partnership with NHS Scotland and the Scottish Government, were handed out by Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport Jeane Freeman.</p>
      <p>She said: “These awards represent the very high regard that people in Scotland hold for our health and social care services. They are a testimony to you. Every single day you get up in the morning and go to work determined to do the best possible job that you can.</p>
      <p>“To any of you here tonight who come from the European Union mainland countries, the 27, let me say again what we keep saying, ‘You are valued. You are welcome. And we so want you to stay’.”</p>
      <p>Lauren Templeman of NHS Fife picked up the Support Worker Award.</p>
      <p>She is the only therapy support worker in the community multi-disciplinary team in the child and adolescent mental health practice at the Kirkman Clinic in Kirkcaldy, and it’s thanks to her intervention and support that many of her patients haven’t had to be admitted to an adolescent psychiatric hospital.</p>
      <p>The Innovation Award was dedicated to those in the NHS who push boundaries to develop new forms of treatment for their patients.</p>
      <p>Picking up the award was the Intelligent Liver Function Testing Team, which brings together experts from NHS Tayside and the University of Dundee whose aim is to reduce the mortality, morbidity and cost of late-presenting liver disease.</p>

      <p>She said: “Thank you to my volunteers because they’ve made the difference, as well as our health and social care partnership because they support us and provide the funds.”</p>
      <p>Harvé Symonds went home with the Young Achiever Award.</p>
      <p>A patient she cared for as an auxiliary nurse at the Balfour Hospital in Kirkwall in NHS Orkney nominated her after being admitted due to an injury while on holiday on the island.</p>
      <p>Dr Scott Mackie of NHS Lanarkshire picked up the Optometrist Award for his work with a patient who had incomplete achromatopsia and type-two cone dystrophy, a rare visual impairment leading to multiple vision problems.</p>
      <p>NHS Ayrshire &amp; Arran’s Ann Allan collected the Midwife Award for her work in supporting vulnerable women throughout their pregnancies.</p>
      <p>She said: “There are only seven midwives and we cover the whole of Ayrshire, covering all aspects of vulnerability.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Jordan Bain from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde collected the Dentist Award.</p>
      <p>He was born into a home where drugs were prevalent and enjoys his time working in Springburn, claiming it’s a privilege “to make people smile”.</p>
      <p>The Care at Home Pharmacy Technician Service Team of NHS Ayrshire &amp; Arran scooped the Integrated Care Award for their work with elderly and vulnerable people with medication issues, and the Care for Mental Health Award was presented to worthy winners National Distress Brief Intervention Programme Team of NHS Lanarkshire, who bring together health and social care with the emergency services to provide early intervention and improve the outcomes of people experiencing distress.</p>
