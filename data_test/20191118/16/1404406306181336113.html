      <p>TK Kirkland opened up to VladTV about money changing Suge Knight. He explained that Suge was his bodyguard on the NWA tour back in the day, and TK told viewers that Suge is actually a "nice guy." He went on to say that money turned Suge into the person he is, which led to TK and DJ Vlad speaking about Suge's long prison sentence. TK said that he hopes Suge gets the chance to come out and be "reborn" as a new person, using Gucci Mane as an example, which you can hear more about above.</p>
