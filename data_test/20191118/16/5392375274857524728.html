      <p>Information from the China Institute of Information and Communications (CIIC) shows that since the launch of the new iPhone, its shipments in the Chinese market have increased by 6% year-on-year. In addition, CIIC data shows that smartphone shipments between September and October in China is 69.3 million units, down 5% year-on-year. However, iPhone shipments increased by 6%.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg’s calculations show that in September and October this year, iPhone sales in the Chinese market is about 10 million. This once again confirms people’s expectations regarding the sales momentum of the iPhone 11. There is a common belief that the iPhone 11 series will sell far stronger than the previous generation. This is exactly what is happening for now. Currently, the Chinese market is second only to the US domestic market for Apple’s profitability.</p>
      <h3>Apple CEO and analysts have their say</h3>
      <p>Apple CEO, Tim Cook, has said that new pricing, monthly payment options, and trade-in policies have driven iPhone sales in the Chinese market.</p>
      <p>Nicole Peng, an analyst at market research firm Canalys, said: “The enthusiasm of Chinese consumers to buy iPhone 11 series phones seems to be higher than last year due to lower retail prices. We see that the shipment of old models has declined. However, the shipments of new models are very strong.”</p>
      <p>According to a prediction from Zhang Jun, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, iPhone 11 will sell more than 12 million units in November. This will be a 15% a year-on-year increase relative to last year’s iPhone XR. According to him, by the end of the year, the sales of iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will reach 70 million. Nevertheless, by Q1 and Q2 2020, the total iPhone production will decline year on year.</p>
