      <p>He is accused of murdering Madam See Keng Keng at about 7.24pm atÂ a seventh-floor unit at Block 7A Commonwealth Avenue on Oct 27.</p>
      <p>He was charged last month with murdering 56-year-old Lee Soh Mui, his mother. According to charge sheets, he committed this act at about the same time as the murder of his grandmother, but it allegedly occurred at another unit on the same floor at the block that day.</p>
      <p>Goh said: "I want to apologise to the relatives of my mum and grandma. I want to clarify. What happened was an accident. I had no control over my actions and I never intended for those things to happen."</p>
      <p>District Judge Terence Tay stopped him and told him that he may want to reserve the details for later, in case he got a lawyer on board.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said the Institute of Mental Health had requested an extension in remand.</p>
      <p>The judge ordered Goh to be further remanded at Changi Prison's Complex Medical Centre and to return to court on Nov 25.</p>
      <p>Goh was arrested on the night of Oct 27 after the two women were found dead at the block in Commonwealth.</p>
      <p>Paramedics pronounced both women dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>It was the second reported murder case that day, with a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/63-year-old-man-found-dead-in-ang-mo-kio-woman-arrested-12038616">63-year-old man found dead in Ang Mo Kio</a> that morning. <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/633-ang-mo-kio-murder-woman-charged-12040074">A 54-year-old woman was arrested</a> in that case, and was charged with murdering the man.</p>
      <p>If found guilty of murder, Goh could be sentenced to death.</p>
