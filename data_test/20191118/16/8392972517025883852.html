      <p>Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield collapsed into giggles on Monday's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a>, and viewers at home couldn't help laughing along with them.</p>
      <p>Today (November 18), the likeable pair were left in tears of laughter during what should have been a reasonably serious shopping segment with Alice Beer.</p>

      <p>Consumer specialist Alice appeared on the show to talk through some of the 'winter warmer gadgets' that might hopefully help viewers get out of bed on a winter's morning.</p>
      <p>From full-body hot water bottles to the latest heated duvets, Alice talked the presenting duo through different ways of keeping warm wherever you are this winter.</p>

      <p>So far so sensible...</p>

      <p>But when Alice presented the duo with a microwavable hand warmer and referred to it as a "muff", the pair couldn't contain their laughter at the innuendo.</p>
      <p>The cute sheep hand warmer left the hosts in hysterics, as Alice said: "This is like a muff and it smells of lavender. Who knew my muff smelled of lavender?"</p>
      <p>As the presenters began to dissolve into sniggers, Phil said: "What are you doing? You're digging yourself a massive hole and you're throwing us all in it."</p>

      <p>Alice continued: "Well, you keep your hand in it and you keep warm. What's the problem?"</p>
      <p>They later moved on to discuss strap-ons... Oo-er missus!</p>
      <p>Fans were amused at home, too, with one tweeting: "Although I am quite prudish I do laugh with the innuendos @thismorning @Schofe @hollywills. Muffs and strap-ons, small minds hey?"</p>
      <p>Another said: "Phil and Holly crack me up - killing themselves laughing at the woman saying muff and then Phil saying strap-on #ThisMorning."</p>

      <p>However, some accused the hosts of making the "same old tired jokes" and one accused Holly of being "immature".</p>
      <p>Long-term fans of This Morning won't be surprised to hear of Phil and Holly's behaviour, as they are well known for their uncontrollable giggling fits on air.</p>
      <p>Last month, the pair were <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/this-morning-viewers-slam-holly-willoughby-and-phillip-schofield-for-laughing-during-halloween-segment/">criticised for laughing through a Halloween segment</a> so much they couldn't speak.</p>
      <p>Some viewers accused the pair of being unprofessional.</p>
      <p>However, they have insisted they are <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/daytime-tv/this-morning/phillip-schofield-and-holly-willoughby-are-never-told-off-for-giggling/">never told off for giggling</a>.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.yours.co.uk/">Yours</a> magazine last year, Phillip, 57, said: "That's never happened.</p>
      <p>"Holly and I both know how far to go. There is definitely a kind of 'laughing in church' element to it and once we start, it can be hard to stop, but one of us manages to pull it back.</p>
      <p>"We get on so well and always have done," he added.</p>
      <p>"We have a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/holly-willoughby-and-phillip-schofield-make-fun-of-chef-gino-dacampos-new-look/">shared sense of humour</a> that works at the same speed."</p>
