        <b>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-game-of-the-year-edition/morrowind-mods-rebirth">Morrowind Rebirth</a> version 5.0 <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-game-of-the-year-edition/morrowind-rebirth-version-5-launch">launched</a>, bringing the biggest update to the massive mod yet. Now, part two is here, with location overhauls, bug fixes, quality-of-life changes, and new items, armour, weapons, and features aplenty to enjoy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Uploaded to <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/morrowind-rebirth/news/release-morrowind-rebirth-50-part-2">ModDB</a> by user Trancemaster_1988, Morrowind Rebirth 5.0 Part Two reworks three of the Elder Scrolls III’s locations: Balmora’s Labour Town District,  Molag Mar, and Ald Velothi. Molag Mar gets a new tavern, plus new houses, a trader, “more clutter” and people to pester (NPCs), while  the little harbour of Ald Velothi gets some more detailing and a “semi-destroyed” wall surrounding it.</p>
      <p>New armour includes an Imperial Roundshield, a Golden Saint Shield, and Silver Bracers, with enchanted armour including a Glimmering Helm, Vigorous Boots, Prismatic Greaves, Crimson Shield, and a Fortuitous Hand. Weapons new to the update are a Chitin throwing knife, and a Daedric field arrow.</p>
      <p>The Morrowind Rebirth version 5.0 part two update also brings a raft of new potions for all your fortification and resistance needs, artifact – Voidwalker – and a book full of ghastly gags if its name is anything to go by: Netch Herder’s Book of Jokes. Plus, you can sample an all-new beverage after a hard day’s adventuring with the just-added drink, Wickwheat ale.</p>

      <p>There are four new spells to help you cure your companions, too, addressing issues like Blight Disease, Common Disease, Paralysis, and plain Poison.</p>
      <p>The mod update also adds a bunch of balance changes, graphics adjustments, fixes, broader Morrowind Rebirth tweaks, and (a lot) more that helps you get even more out of the game.
