      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Ryan Costello, a 23-year-old <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Minnesota-Twins/?tps=1">Minnesota Twins</a> prospect, was found dead in a hotel room Monday in New Zealand. Preliminary indications suggest he died of natural causes, according to his Australian Baseball League team.</p>
      <p>The Aukland Tuatara released a <a href="https://aucklandtuatara.com/news/tuatara-devastated-by-costellos-passing/">statement on Costello's death</a> Monday morning. Costello arrived in Aukland, New Zealand, last week to play his first season with the team.</p>
      <p>"The Tuatara would like to express their deepest condolences to Ryan's family back home in the United States and to the whole Minnesota Twins organization," the Tuatara said.</p>
      <p>"Support is being offered to the Tuatara players, who are naturally devastated at the moment."</p>
      <p>The Wethersfield, Conn., native was a 31st round pick by the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Seattle-Mariners/?tps=1">Seattle Mariners</a> in the 2017 MLB Draft. He played collegiately at Central Connecticut State University.</p>
      <p>Costello spent the 2019 season between the Single-A Fort Myers Miracle and Double-A Pensacola Blue Wahoos. He played 280 Minor League Baseball games, but never broke into Major League Baseball. Costello hit .290 with 14 home runs during his collegiate career.</p>
      <p>He hit a go-ahead three-run home run in the 2018 Florida State League Championship Series to help lead the Miracle to their second title in five years.</p>
      <p>"We were very sad to learn the news about the passing of former Miracle infielder Ryan Costello this morning," the <a href="https://twitter.com/MiracleBaseball/status/1196435940148994050">Miracle tweeted</a>. "His home run helped lift the Miracle to the FSL Championship in 2018. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and the entire Twins organization."</p>

      <p>The Mariners traded Costello and Chase De Jong to the Twins in July 2018 in exchange for pitcher <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Zach_Duke/?tps=1">Zach Duke</a> and cash.</p>
      <p>"Ryan's <a href="https://twitter.com/jzoll36/status/1196435176139689988">infectious energy and drive</a> for greatness will never be forgotten," Twins assistant general manager Jeremy Zoll tweeted. "He is the definition of a great teammate and has been taken from us far too soon. Sending thoughts and prayers to the Costello family."</p>
      <p>The Tuatara face the Perth Heat Wednesday at North Harbour Stadium in Aukland.</p>
