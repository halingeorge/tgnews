      <h1>Good news for Watford as player finally returns to training</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:44:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Hurrah! Cucho Hernandez has finally returned to training.</p>
      <p>The 20 year was loaned to Mallorca in the summer window and hasn’t played a minute of football for them due a knee injury picked up for Colombia at the U20 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month it was reported in Spain that the Watford owned player hadn’t even physically been to his new club, and there was a growing curiosity about the transfer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://eldesmarque.com/actualidad/futbol/primera-laliga-santander/mallorca/1357204-mallorca-entrena-con-el-colombiano-cucho-hernandez-como-gran-novedad">El Desmarque</a> say it was a ‘great novelty’ to see the player on the training pitch for Mallorca on Monday, and now hope is building about what he can bring to the team.</p>
      <p>Cucho impressed when on loan from Watford to Huesca, and Mallorca could really do with someone to find the back of the net regularly. They’re currently 16th in La Liga and have only scored 12 goals in 13 games so far this season, every team above them has scored more.</p>
      <p>The club’s manager Vicente Moreno has said he views Cucho as a winter signing, which suggests he’s not going to be ready immediately.</p>
      <p>Watford will surely be hoping their player can have a good second half of the season.</p>
