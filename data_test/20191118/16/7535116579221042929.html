      <p>As we approach the year end, many are planning on jet-setting off on holidays with their significant others and families. However, social-personality psychologist, <a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/good-travel/travel-with-friends-for-happiness/">Dr. William Chopik</a>, suggests that spending time with your gal pals might be just what you need instead as friendships “are a way to derive all the benefits of being in a relationship with someone without the enormity of it.”</p>

      <p>He goes on to explain how taking time out to hang with your friends can generally boost happiness levels due to the social connections that are being formed during this process.</p>
      <p>And yes, that’s COMPLETELY different from “spending time” with your loved ones on screen or over the phone. When you physically are around people you care about the psychologist says:</p>
      <p>“You can sit down, look them in the eye, have a true back-and-forth and read each other’s body language.”</p>

      <p>“They can see you and your facial expressions. You’re emotionally responding to things and you can pick up on their emotions. You don’t always get that through a phone call.”</p>

      <p>In fact, a recent study from <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-health-benefits-of-strong-relationships">Harvard </a>proves that those who spend time with their friends are “happier, have fewer health problems, and live longer”.</p>
      <p>But that’s not all. Going away on a trip with friends will reportedly bring about LONG TERM health benefits because “social connections like these not only give pleasure, they also influence our long-term health in ways every bit as powerful as adequate sleep, a good diet and not smoking.”</p>
