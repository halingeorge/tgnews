      <h1>Five candidates for the 2019 General Election in Torbay</h1>
      <h2>Previous Tory MP Kevin Foster is defending the seat he first won from the Liberal Democrats in 2015</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:03:29+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Oldfield</a></address>
      <p>Five candidates are competing for votes at the 2019 General Election in Torbay.</p>
      <p>Previous Tory MP Kevin Foster is defending the seat he first won from the Liberal Democrats in 2015.</p>
      <p>Two years later at the General Election following the Brexit Referendum, Mr Foster increased his majority from 3,000 to 14,000.</p>
      <p>The stalled Brexit process has added a new and unpredictable element to the vote on Thursday, December 12.</p>
      <p>Torbay voted around six to four in favour of leaving the European Union. </p>
      <p>Mr Foster, a government minister, has been a firm backer of prime minister Boris Johnson and his attempts to get his new Brexit deal approved by Parliament.</p>
      <p>The Tory campaign in Torbay was due to benefit from the decision by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage not to challenge sitting Conservative MPs.</p>
      <p>But former Brexit Party candidate James Channer has defied the instruction and is standing as an Independent.</p>
      <p>Conservatives are concerned that a pro-Brexit candidate could split the Leave vote, benefiting the Remain-supporting Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>This time the Liberal Democrat challenger is Lee Howgate, a teacher and former diplomat who is a member of Torbay Council for the Goodrington with Roselands ward.</p>
      <p>The Labour Party candidate is Michele Middleditch, and the Green Party challenger is Sam Moss, who stood at the June 2017 vote.</p>
      <p>The Torbay constituency covers the towns of Torquay and Paignton, with neighbouring Brixham covered by the Totnes MP.</p>
      <p>Analysis carried out for the In Your Area website says the Liberal Democrats would need a 14 per cent swing to win in Torbay, with Labour needing a 17.4 per cent switch of support.</p>
      <p>The constituency has a population of 100,000 with 76,000 eligible to vote.</p>
