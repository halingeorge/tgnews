      <p>The sources also told the publication that fans can expect a two week shorter edition of the show, and that producers will be using "test Islanders" ahead of the main cast's arrival.</p>
      <p>They said: "It has been decided that the show will run six weeks instead of the usual eight. The new cast of singletons fly out just days before the launch but bosses work with test Islanders to uncover the best spots in the villa to create drama."</p>
      <p>As well as Caroline, fans will be happy to know that comedian Iain Stirling will again be lending his voice to the show as the drama unfolds.</p>
      <p>"Do you know what?" he told Good Morning Britain, "Winter Love Island is gonna come back sooner that you thought and it's gonna be enjoyable."</p>
