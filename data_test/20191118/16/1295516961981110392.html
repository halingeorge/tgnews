      <h1>Star Wars Lifts the 'Spoiler Ban' on The Mandalorian's 'Asset'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:11:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Johnson</a></address>
      <p>The biggest surprise of Disney+'s <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-mandalorian/"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a> so far has been the identity of "the asset." Those still unaware had better watch the series' first episode sooner rather than later, though, as Disney has unofficially lifted its spoiler ban.</p>
      <p>Not that there ever was one, but Disney itself apparently feels it's OK to now openly discuss "the asset." An image of said asset appeared on Star Wars' official twitter page Monday, showing the adorable, blanket-swaddled creature many refer to as Baby Yoda.</p>

      <p>"Species age differently," is all the tweet states. Nothing new is revealed about the infant, but the image is the first officially posted by Disney. Those who had the revelation spoiled for them can now shoulder Disney with the blame.</p>

      <p>Jedi Master Yoda was over 900 years old when he quietly passed on in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, and since <i>The Mandalorian</i> takes place only several years later, the infant clearly isn't Yoda. The baby does demonstrate <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-mandalorian-baby-yoda-force-powers/">Jedi-like powers</a> in the series' second episode, however.</p>
      <p>And it's possible the baby could be a clone of Yoda -- this is <i>Star Wars</i>, after all.</p>
      <p>Created by Jon Favreau, <i>The Mandalorian</i> stars Pedro Pascal, Gina Carano, Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Emily Swallow, Omid Abtahi, Werner Herzog and Nick Nolte. The first two episodes are streaming now on Disney+.</p>
