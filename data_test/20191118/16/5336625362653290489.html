      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> Tempur-Pedic <a href="https://zdcs.link/VOrWL">memory foam pillows </a>and <a href="https://zdcs.link/3PkNw">mattress toppers</a> are on sale at Amazon, saving you up to 36% on a supportive, cloud-like sleep setup.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Black Friday puts a huge focus on big purchases like TVs or new home appliances, but mattresses are <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/oct-31-what-not-to-buy-black-friday/">one thing you shouldn't buy on Black Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>For whatever reason, mattresses see their biggest sales over three-day holiday weekends (like Labor Day) or during the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/black-friday-what-to-buy-skip/">white sales</a>, which take place in January. New Year's sales might get you a decent discount on a mattress, but if you were thinking you'd score a new bed for cheap in the next fews weeks, you'll need to rethink.</p>
      <p>Memory foam pillows and mattress toppers can give your bed the plush, supportive feeling that you've been missing. Maybe you'll even realize those three inches of support is all you needed, and you can skip a new mattress altogether. A <a href="https://zdcs.link/q2pGG">handful of Tempur-Pedic items are on sale at Amazon</a> today, so you can test out a new sleeping plan without spending $1,000.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/3PkNw">Tempur-Pedic ProForm Supreme 3-inch Mattress Topper </a>— save up to 36%</h3>

      <p>Test out a Tempur-Pedic mattress without having to completely commit to one — or awkwardly lay on one in the store. This ProForm Supreme topper is made with the same pressure-relieving material as Tempur-Pedic's mattresses and provides three inches of cushion to cradle those points in your back that usually sink in and get stiff. Regularly $299 to $449 (depending on size) you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/3PkNw">save up to $164</a> on and get a king topper for less than the original price of a twin.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/65qdR">Tempur-ProForm Cloud Pillow</a> — save $20</h3>

      <p>Your neck needs attention, too. This pillow is literally called the Cloud because of how soft it is, but it still provides the signature pressure-relieving material that adapts to your head, neck, and shoulders for personalized support. And unlike regular pillows that get lumpy after use, this one returns to its original position every time. Regularly $69, you can save $20 and <a href="https://zdcs.link/65qdR">get it for $48.99</a>. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/o7Wjg">Tempur-Cloud Breeze</a> dual pillow is a spinoff of the Cloud but features a layer of breeze gel on both sides for sleepers who get too hot during the night. It's usually $169, but you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/o7Wjg">save $53 and get it for $115.99</a>.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/mxvKq">Tempur-Ergo Neck Pillow </a>— $85.49 (save $13.51)</h3>

      <p>Prefer a more controlled sleeping posture? The Tempur-Ergo Neck Pillow's asymmetrical shape was designed specifically to contour your head and neck in a way that flat pillows can't. It has firmer support than others in Tempur-Pedic's lineup and is best for side and back sleepers. Regularly $99, you can save $13.51 and <a href="https://zdcs.link/mxvKq">get it for $85.49</a>.</p>
