      <h1>Odd behind-the-scenes details from Prince Andrew's interview in Queen's quarters at Palace</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew was grilled by Emily Maitlis about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, but the moments leading up to the televised chat were slightly odd</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:23:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:23</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Many people sitting down to watch Prince Andrew's interview about his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein were left stunned and baffled by a number of his remarks.</p>
      <p>He told Newsnight's Emily Maitlis that he didn't sweat - something that has also left medical experts scratching their heads, and couldn't have had sex with accuser Victoria Roberts as he was at Pizza Express in Woking.</p>
      <p>But before he had even started talking about the convicted sex offender's "unbecoming" behaviour, there were a number of bizarre moments between the Queen's son and Maitlis.</p>
      <p>Writing for the Times, Maitlis reveals what happened on the day she went to Buckingham Palace to ask Andrew a series of very difficult questions.</p>
      <p>When the crew arrived they were taken in through the Queen's entrance and started to set up in the south drawing room.</p>

      <p>She writes: "I am trying to understand the significance of the Queen giving us her own formal quarters in which to film, but it feels like a code I do not properly understand. Is she endorsing her son? The need for this interview? Or am I reading way too much into every step, merely because there are so many of them."</p>
      <p>She admits then when she walked into the room she was so taken by her surroundings that didn't immediately spot that Andrew was already there.</p>
      <p>She was carrying so much stuff that she didn't have a free hand to shake his, and feared that if she tried to curtsy she "may not make it back up again".</p>

      <p>When she nipped to the bathroom she realised she had chocolate on her teeth, which she wiped off with what she realised a moment too late was a Buckingham Palace handtowl.</p>
      <p>She writes: "This is the most disastrous start to any interview I can imagine. And then I suddenly recognise it for what it is: pure stomach-gripping nerves. And the recognition of something so obvious relaxed me."</p>
      <p>Back in the room, Andrew was offering advice to the engineering team setting up the make-shift set.</p>

      <p>She writes: "He starts directing the mike placement until the cameraman and the sound engineer are following his orders. He finally sits back, satisfied that he has solved a technical conundrum for the team."</p>
      <p>She says that Andrew didn't seem particularly nervous in the lead up to their chat, which was scheduled to last 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has been heavily criticised for a number of his comments in the interview, including the shocking moment when he described Epstein's record as a convicted sex offender as "unbecoming".</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes palace sources have described the duke's performance as “utterly jaw dropping” with one insider suggesting aides were left “dumbfounded” after watching the Newsnight interview on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>But the duke apparently saw it differently, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-tells-queen-jeffrey-20905061">telling friends he thought the interview went “pretty well”</a> after being quizzed on allegations he had sex with Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre (nee Roberts), who claims the paedophile kept her as a "slave".</p>
