      <p>Memes are a quintessential part of our lives. Memes transcend age and sometimes we’ll find our grandmothers or mothers laughing at Minion memes. However, we do forget that meme pages are run by humans too and they are also susceptible to making mistakes.</p>
      <p>For example, this man who runs his own meme page was exposed by a girl for sending out messages asking for her to send nudes.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the screenshots:</p>

      <p>According to the screenshots, he says was feeling a little stressed, so he needed the girl to send him some nudes. To instigate her to send him these photos, he also told her that he “does not really have hope in life anymore”. He adds that her nudes are his motivation to live and says that if she can’t send him butt pictures then it’s ok, but she still needs to send her “belly button to thighs” pictures.</p>
      <p>When asked about his girlfriend, he admits that he has one but needs companionship.</p>

      <p>To add more context to the screenshots, the girl is 15 years old. He knows that as a fact and also encouraged her to send her nudes to him even though he knew she has a boyfriend.</p>
      <p>After she has posted the messages and it went viral, she received tons of messages from other women sharing their experiences:</p>

      <p>In this conversation with another woman, he asks about her virginity and complained that his female friends around him who are not putting out are “so conservative”. At the end of the conversation, he admits that he is a “ham sap lou”, meaning ‘perverted man’ in Cantonese.”</p>

      <p>In another conversation, he said that he is stressed out because of an exam that he’ll have soon, so to destress, he told the woman that he was looking for orgy parties around him.</p>

      <p>In this screenshot, he asked a woman to show him period panties. He thought he was being stealthy by asking her to show him an example but it didn’t work out.</p>

      <p>A friend of the perverted man then texted one of the victims and said, “I was his friend but I’m texting you right now to tell you that all the things he did to you, he did to me too, and he really is disgusting.”</p>
      <p>His meme page, Facebook account and Instagram accounts do not exist any longer and in the true meme fashion, people are now making memes about him. This is the best one as of now:</p>

      <p>Before you start to shame the victims for still talking to him after he has said so many things, some of them had already told him explicitly that they were not comfortable with talking to him. Others who couldn’t take it anymore resorted to blocking him.</p>
      <p>
        <i>So, that’s the end of this saga as of now. What do you think about this?</i>
