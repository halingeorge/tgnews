      <p>At least three people have been killed in a shooting at a Walmart supermarket in Duncan, Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>The shooter is believed be among those killed in the massacre, which took place around 10am CST Monday.</p>
      <p>They opened fire in a parking lot outside the store, with locals claiming the shooting was related to a domestic dispute, rather than a random attack.</p>
      <p>Multiple unconfirmed reports say the gunman shot his ex-wife and her new boyfriend, before turning his weapon on himself.</p>
      <p>One local whose son works at the store said: ‘Shots were NOT fired inside the Duncan WalMart. It was a murder-suicide in the parking lot.’</p>
      <p>The woman said her family had been badly shaken by the news, which comes three months after a mass-shooter opened fire at a Walmrart in El Paso, Texas, and killed 22 people.</p>
