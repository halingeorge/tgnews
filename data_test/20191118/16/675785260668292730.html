      <h1>Lib Dems lose general election debate court battle to have Jo Swinson included</h1>
      <h2>The party had said it was unlawful to not invite the Lib Dem leader to tomorrow's head to head debate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:37:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats have lost a High Court challenge to demand Jo Swinson be invited to tomorrow's head to head TV debate.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> brought a joint challenge against ITV over its decision to exclude their party leaders from the televised election debate.</p>
      <p>Two leading judges ruled there was "no arguable breach of the Broadcasting Code".</p>
      <p>Lord Justice Davis, sitting with Mr Justice Warby, said: "The clear conclusion of both members of this court is that, viewed overall, these claims are not realistically arguable.</p>
      <p>"It follows that the television debate scheduled for tomorrow evening between the leader of the Conservative Party and the leader of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Party may lawfully go ahead."</p>

      <p>ITV is hosting a head-to-head debate between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> on Tuesday, which will not include any other party leaders.</p>
      <p>Lib Dem representatives lodged papers at the  court  in London last week and said it was "vital for our democracy" to have both sides of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> debate included in TV debates during the election campaign.</p>
      <p>And Scottish First Minister Ms Sturgeon said last week that it is "fundamentally unfair" for other parties to be cut out of the debate.</p>
      <p>Sky News has proposed a November 28 date for its debate, while the BBC has confirmed it will host two debates, on November 29 and December 6, in addition to a series of Question Time specials.</p>
