        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/prince-andrew">Prince Andrew</a> has faced major criticism after his “BBC Newsnight” interview, where he denied sleeping with a woman who says she was sex trafficked to him by Jeffrey Epstein in 2001.</li>
        <li>Even though Virginia Roberts Giuffre <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew-virginia-roberts-court-case-2019-7">says she slept with the Duke of York three times</a> – in London, New York, and on Epstein’s private island in the Virgin Islands in 2001 – Andrew said in the interview he doesn’t recall meeting her.</li>
        <li>The interview has been labeled “grotesque” and “disastrous” by royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams, who told Insider that even though <a href="https://royalcentral.co.uk/uk/york/prince-andrews-future-as-a-working-royal-revealed-133591/">there have now been calls for the royal to step down from his official duties</a>, this likely won’t happen.</li>
        <li>“He currently has over 200 patronages but is unlikely to keep them,” he added. “It remains to be seen what royal engagements he is involved in the future.”</li>
        <li>This comes as Giuffre’s lawyer Jack Scarola has publicly urged Andrew to speak with the FBI instead of the media.</li>
        <li>“I would love to see Prince Andrew submit to an interview under oath with the investigating authorities. Talking to the media doesn’t quite cut it. Statements that are not under oath carry little weight,” Scarola told the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/prince-andrew-interview-virginia-roberts-giuffre-lawyer-police-jeffrey-epstein-a9205956.html">Mail Online.</a></li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/prince-andrew">The Duke of York</a> has faced major backlash after denying claims he slept with a woman who says she was sex trafficked to him by Jeffrey Epstein on “BBC Newsnight.”</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew said he couldn’t remember ever meeting Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims that Epstein <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew-virginia-roberts-court-case-2019-7">forced her to have sex with the royal in his New York mansion, in London, and on his private island in the Virgin Islands back in 2001.</a> He also suggested a photograph of himself with a hand around Giuffre’s waist <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-suggests-virginia-roberts-epstein-photo-is-fake-2019-11">could be fake.</a></p>
      <p>Now royal watchers, lawyers, and celebrities are weighing in on what’s next for the duke after the “grotesque” interview that has all of the United Kingdom – and the world – analyzing his every move.</p>
      <h3>Prince Andrew’s interview not only displayed ‘a dreadful breakdown in communications at Buckingham Palace,’ but it was also ‘so damaging to the monarchy’</h3>
      <p>A source close to the duke told The Sun that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-andrew-told-queen-bbc-epstein-interview-went-well-reports-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">he referred to the interview as “a great success”</a> in conversation at church on Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, there has been speculation as to whether the Queen actually approved the interview, with royal correspondent Richard Palmer writing on Twitter that <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalReporter/status/1196193907505336320">Her Majesty was “aware” but has been careful not to say she approves.</a></p>

      <p>“He [Prince Andrew] has defended that grotesque interview, something he should not have been allowed to do,” royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams told Insider.</p>
      <p>“He clearly has totally failed to understand what went so horribly wrong and reportedly actually thinks it went well,” Fitzwilliams went on. “So he is in denial. There is obviously a dreadful breakdown in communications at Buckingham Palace which needs urgently to be rectified as it is so damaging to the monarchy.”</p>

      <p>Ian Kirby, head of media at MHP Communications and former political editor at the News of the World, told Insider that the palace’s aim would have been for Andrew to remind viewers that he is a hard-working member of the royal family. However, the duke appeared to achieve the opposite result.</p>
      <p>“Buckingham Palace had three aims from this encounter – express regret at the relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, empathy with his victims, and to remind viewers the Prince is a worthy and hard-working member of the ‘Team,'” Kirby told Insider.</p>
      <p>“However, the stubborn and rather odd code of honor Prince Andrew adopted about his former friend, which came out under close questioning, meant the first two aims failed and the third was shoehorned into the final clips,” he added.</p>
      <p>When Andrew was asked whether he regretted his friendship with Epstein by interviewer Emily Maitlis, he said he didn’t, explaining that “the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful.”</p>
      <p>This statement – along with the prince’s ability to <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-pizza-express-alibi-virginia-giuffre-allegation-2019-11">remember he was at a Pizza Express in Woking 18 years ago</a>, but not ever meeting Giuffre – has seemed to only harm the public’s perception of him.</p>
      <p>“This was the interview that Buckingham Palace thought would turn everything around for Prince Andrew – the first senior Royal since Princess Diana to subject themselves to hostile questioning from one of the BBC’s most forensic interviewers,” Kirby told Insider.</p>
      <p>“In the end, <a href="https://time.com/5731244/prince-andrew-interview-epstein/">he said he had learned a lot</a> from a sex trafficker,” he said. “Not the result they wanted.”</p>
      <p>“#PrinceAndrew’s interview on BBC is textbook predator coverup speak,” actress and activist <a href="https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/1196270271868678144">Rose McGowan wrote on Twitter.</a></p>

      <p>“This is what power abuse is folks,” the tweet went on. “We must recognize it to stop it. See beyond the lies. Tell the truth. Get clean.”</p>
      <p>Even though 83% of people polled by Royal Central said <a href="https://royalcentral.co.uk/uk/york/prince-andrews-future-as-a-working-royal-revealed-133591/">Prince Andrew should no longer carry out official duties</a> on behalf of the Queen, Fitzwilliams added that it’s “unlikely he will actually step down.”</p>
      <p>“However he has become an object of derision and cannot expect to be taken seriously again as a senior royal,” he added.</p>
      <p>“He currently has over 200 patronages but is unlikely to keep them,” Fitzwilliams said. “It remains to be seen what royal engagements he is involved in the future.”</p>
      <h3>‘Statements that are not made under oath carry little weight’</h3>
      <p>When Prince Andrew was asked whether he would speak under oath about his relationship with Epstein, he said: “I’m like everybody else and I will have to take all the legal advice that there was before I was to do that sort of thing. But if push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so, then I would be duty-bound to do so.”</p>
      <p>However, lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing five Epstein victims, told Good Morning Britain that the duke shouldn’t have to wait to see what his attorneys think before cooperating with this case.</p>
      <p>“He’s been in the court of public opinion, now it’s time for him to take seriously the allegations against Mr. Epstein and others that are being investigated,” Allred said, adding that “He may very well have evidence or information that is relevant to possibly prosecuting others who conspired to help sex traffic underage girls.”</p>
      <p>Now Giuffre’s lawyer Jack Scarola has spoken out about the interview, saying he believes the prince should “submit an interview under oath.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“I believe there is an ongoing investigation in New York by the FBI under the supervision of the US attorney’s office into those involved in facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse,” Scarola told the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/prince-andrew-interview-virginia-roberts-giuffre-lawyer-police-jeffrey-epstein-a9205956.html">Mail Online.</a></p>
      <p>“I would love to see Prince Andrew submit to an interview under oath with the investigating authorities,” he went on. “Talking to the media doesn’t quite cut it. Statements that are not under oath carry little weight.”</p>
      <p>“He may well find himself involved in the FBI inquiry into Epstein,” Fitzwilliams told Insider. “If he did intend to make a statement about the allegations against him, he would have been wise to make a deposition to it before opening his mouth so disastrously.”</p>
      <p>When contacted by Insider about the recent call for the duke to cooperate with the FBI, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson replied: “The Duke of York’s words in his interview speak for themselves.”</p>
