      <h1>Rohan Bopanna injures shoulder, Aisam ul Haq Qureshi pulls out of Davis Cup tie in protest</h1>
      <h2>The left-handed Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan was named as one of the three reserves in the eight-member squad announced by the AITA selection committee to replace Rohan Bopanna.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:42:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Senior player Rohan Bopanna pulled out of India’s upcoming tie against Pakistan due to a shoulder injury, paving the way for Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan’s inclusion in the playing squad.</p>
      <p>Bopanna, who underwent an MRI scan on Monday, communicated his unavailability to non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal. The 39-year-old was expected to be paired with veteran Leander Paes for the doubles rubber of the November 29-30 tie.</p>
      <p>Left-handed Nedunchezhiyan was named as one of the three reserves in the eight-member squad announced by the AITA selection committee.</p>
      <p>“It’s disappointing not to have Rohan in the side. But we want him to protect his shoulder. He needs shots (injection) for treatment. We have an able replacement in Jeevan. He has done well on the Tour and we will have a good left-right combination,” Rajpal told PTI.</p>
      <p>Bopanna is country’s top doubles player. Now the two best-ranked players are not available for the tie. Divij Sharan is also unavailable because of his wedding reception. Nedunchezhiyan has been knocking on the doors of the Indian Davis Cup team for some time by consistently performing on the ATP tour.</p>
      <h3>Aisam ul Haq Qureshi pulls out</h3>
      <p>Pakistan’s top doubles player Aisam ul Haq Qureshi on Monday refused to compete in the upcoming Davis Cup tie against India, protesting against ITF’s decision to shift the tie from Islamabad to a neutral venue.</p>
      <p>Aisam, one of the best tennis players coming out of Pakistan, took to Instagram to reason out his decision and made it clear that he won’t play unless the tie is hosted in Islamabad. His post indicated that ITF is set to reject Pakistan Tennis Federation’s appeal against the shifting of tie to a yet-to-be-announced neutral venue.</p>
      <p>Addressing PTF President Salim Saifullah Khan in his post, Aisam criticised India and International Tennis Federation.</p>
      <p>“The attitude towards Pakistan of both All Indian Tennis Association and ITF is highly deplorable, to say it the least.There is absolutely no threat foreseen for Indian tennis team in Pakistan,” Aisam wrote.</p>
      <p>“However, if ITF does not correct their wrong decision then as a protest against this unjust, unfair and biased decision I want to raise my voice and hereby announce not to participate in this tie if it takes place outside Pakistan.”</p>
