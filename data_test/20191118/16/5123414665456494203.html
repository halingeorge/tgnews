      <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/upriseaudio">Uprise Audio</a> keep up the trend of heavy-weight releases with this 2 track slammer forthcoming from Asylum. Having spent nearly 10+ years engulfed in bass heavy music as part of the renowned London based drum &amp; bass collective Vicious Circle, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/asylumasylumasylum">Asylum</a> was no stranger to the low end vibrations of dubstep when he decided to experiment with the slower tempo in 2011. </p>

      <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/magnetic-magazine/premiere-asylum-micro-dose-ua036">Asylum </a>takes it back to its dubstep roots with this track. Eerie textures flow throughout the intro, coupled with a creepy vocal sample, which fades away at the drop. Dark, gully sounds engulf this entire track with a thunderous sub-bass that almost bites at you when it chimes into focus. Wicked EP from Asylum. It drops on the November 22 via all normal online music platforms. </p>
      <p>Make sure you keep up to date with what Uprise Audio are doing over the next year, plenty of releases forthcoming. </p>
