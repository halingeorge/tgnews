        <i>This post covers paid iPhone and iPad apps that have been made available for free for a limited time by their developers. BGR is not affiliated with any app developers. There is no way to tell how long they will be free. These sales could end an hour from now or a week from now — obviously, the only thing we can guarantee is that they were free at the time this post was written. If you click on a link and see a price listed next to an app instead of the word “get,” it is no longer free. The sale has ended. If you download the app anyway, you will be charged by Apple. Some apps may have additional features that require in-app purchases. <a href="https://bgr.com/apps-on-sale/feed/">Subscribe to our RSS feed</a> or use that feed to <a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/147561p-rss-feed-to-email">create an email alert</a> so you’ll be notified as soon as these posts are published and avoid missing any sales.</i>

      <h3>DevPro – Protect Your Device</h3>

      <blockquote>DevPro is a security app that helps you protect your mobile devices. DevPro is activated with a single wipe, registers movements with an adjustable sensitivity and triggers an audible alarm. As an alert sound you can use predefined ones, add external wav files or generate individual own ones.<br/>The backup and alarming is done locally based on the movement of the device. No Internet connection is required. DevPro is self-sufficient.<br/>We invested a lot of time to secure that no one can bypass to unlock the alarm. We use Touch-ID or Face-ID to unlock. No separate code required.<br/>A few more unique functions:<br/>• Adjustable alarm triggering sensitivity<br/>• Adjustable alarm volume<br/>• Directly accessible via widget<br/>• Individual alarms and voice messages<br/>• Preset scenes can be defined (office, hotel, outdoor,…)<br/>• Active in the background<br/>To enable you to start with low upfront activities, we integrated a lot of predefined adjustments you can modify for your now need. At the end we have to be fast to secure the device. To enable this you can define a number of presets like school, hotel, home, library,… to get the right sound, loudness and sensitivity at the right situation.<br/>To enable the device to react on movements we have to track the location also in the background. This enables you to put the device in sleep mode and keep the motion detection still alive.<br/>Why DevPro?<br/>We travel a lot and were scared about the situations in hotels and during fairs. We could not leave our devices on a table or chair while we where absent. To fetch some food from the buffet during breakfast was not so easy for example. Thats why we decided to develop a 100% reliable security system based on the motion detection.<br/>Why Presets?<br/>Important for us, was to take care on different situations where different needs on sensitivity, loudness and alarm sound are needed. We wanted to get this reachable by a single push. Thats why we enabled “Presets” for different situations.<br/>Why Widgets?<br/>Sometimes speed is important if you want to be reliable securing your device. We enabled to use widgets to reach the security mode extremely fast.<br/>We are happy if you will have suggestions how to improve the 100% secure function of DevPro.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>A Microsoft AI for Accessibility grant winner, InnerVoice now features exciting new Azure artificial intelligence technology — which is designed to help all types of individuals become successful communicators.<br/>InnerVoice is a universally designed, easy-to-use, and engaging communication tool that teaches speech, language, and social communication skills to people with a variety of abilities.<br/>InnerVoice can work like a typical communication device: letting your thoughts and feelings be heard and understood by others. Unlike traditional speech-generating apps, though, InnerVoice combines artificial intelligence technology with facial expressions, emotions, tone-of-voice, written words, and videos — providing a complete multi-sensory learning experience.<br/>Visual Language is an exciting new feature that uses Microsoft’s Azure artificial intelligence technology to teach language and literacy skills in a unique way. The camera displays what you’re looking at. Take a picture and watch InnerVoice’s AI system label your picture with text and describe it with speech — allowing users to see the relationships shared among the environment, speech, language, and text.<br/>Microsoft’s Vision makes creating and editing buttons easier than ever: just take a picture and InnerVoice’s AI system labels the button and adds a description.<br/>Learning to ask wh-questions has never been more motivating! Choose an avatar from InnerVoice’s library, use a photo of a face, or a favorite character, and watch them come alive in the app. Avatars move, emote and, most importantly, speak! Watching a face that the learner connects with helps increase imitation and engagement, and it’s a lot of fun, too.<br/>You can even share your words with others by making videos of the avatars speaking your message. Post your thoughts on social media, send a text message — it’s up to you.<br/>App Features:<br/>InnerVoice offers text-to-speech in both English and Spanish.<br/>SPEAK: tap the mouth or the speech bubble and hear the avatar say your words aloud.<br/>SHARE: your avatar will deliver any message to friends, family or social media.<br/>MOVE: add actions to any button to represent verbs, emotions, and concepts by using GIFs by Giphy, as well as Loop, Bounce, and slow-motion videos from Apple.<br/>SEE YOURSELF: take a photo of yourself, a toy, a drawing, and watch it come to life. through facial expressions, facial movements, and expressions.<br/>VIDEO: create video-modeled narratives that help learners understand important situations such as crossing the street, getting in a car, encountering first responders, or other emergencies.<br/>EMOTE: make facial expressions on your avatar’s face to express happiness, sadness, or anger.<br/>EMOJI: make your messages even more personal by using symbols with a universally understood meaning, emoji.<br/>CUSTOMIZE: create new buttons instantly with artificial intelligence and edit layouts with ease, using photos, videos, or GIFs: the simple button-editing system can add a pre-recorded or text-to-speech label to your buttons.<br/>SAVE YOUR WORK: ensure that your buttons and folders are safe from accidental deletions or crashes.<br/>ENHANCE: use language translation or hand-writing recognition keyboards to include other channels of communication.<br/>InnerVoice teaches communication using a unique patent-pending process called Multi-Sensory Semiotics: which pairs sensory stimuli — anything from movements, touch, or sound — with auditory symbols (words), visual symbols (text), or gestural symbols (sign language).<br/>InnerVoice’s design won Mensa’s Intellectual Benefits to Society Award, and it has received funding from numerous prestigious organizations: NewSchools Venture Fund, National Science Foundation/SBIR, and Microsoft.<br/>InnerVoice is designed by iTherapy, LLC, a company of speech-language pathologists, certified autism specialists, and educators who work with people with autism, dyslexia, and other communication disorders.</blockquote>

And if you want to see more devastating things, this is absolutely possible! You can buy super-fast and super-heavy missiles with in-app purchase and increase the destruction! You have also TNTs, which exactly means BIG explosions!<br/>Download now!<br/>The game is free to play! You can change your way to blow up structures in any time.
