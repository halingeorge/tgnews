      <h1>The Rap-Up: Games of the Week for Nov. 18-24</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">JayRosales</a></address>
      <p>Question: When is 5 / 14 shooting and 7 turnovers considered a good game?</p>
      <p>Answer: When you’re a superstar facing the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/toronto-raptors">Raptors</a>’ vaunted D!!</p>
      <p>Toronto completed its toughest road trip of the season — a five-game Western Conference gauntlet that included both title favourites in Tinseltown, last season’s other Conference Finalist, and this season’s playoff sleeper.</p>
      <p>The road swing kicked off in New Orleans, where <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/new-orleans-pelicans">Pelicans</a>’ top scorer <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/276653/brandon-ingram">Brandon Ingram</a> shot 40% and scored 27 points... but was a -25 by night’s end. On the first night of a Staples Center back-to-back, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/285726/og-anunoby">OG Anunoby</a> put the clamps on <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296663/lebron-james">LeBron James</a>, helping limit the future Hall of Famer to 5-for-15 shooting and a season low 13 points. Less than 24 hours later, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/255236/rondae-hollis-jefferson">Rondae Hollis-Jefferson</a> — whose Raptors career was a grand total of 3:59 before the game — disrupted and disturbed former Raptors saviour <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296735/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> to the tune of 2-for-11 shooting and a career-worst nine turnovers.</p>
      <p>Two nights later in Portland, it was <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/282814/fred-vanvleet">Fred VanVleet</a>’s turn to shine at the defensive end, giving <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296642/damian-lillard">Damian Lillard</a> the Steph-Curry-in-the-Finals treatment, holding him to a season-low nine points on 2-for-12 shooting — breaking his 230-game streak of double digit scoring. To wrap up the trip, OG and RHJ kept <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299925/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a> to 5-for-14 shooting, while forcing him to commit seven turnovers.</p>
      <p>As impressive as each of those individual matchups turned out, the team managed to win three of five — all without <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/152220/kyle-lowry">Kyle Lowry</a> and Serge Ibaka. The last time Toronto finished over .500 on a west coast road trip was November 2001!</p>
      <p>Now the Raptors return to the friendly confines of Scotiabank Arena to face two teams with zero players that average 20+ points per game, before flying to Atlanta and facing a third consecutive Southeast team with a sub .500 record.</p>
      <p>Home sweet home! Now onto this week’s games.</p>

      <h3>November 18 vs. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/charlotte-hornets"><b>Charlotte Hornets</b></a></h3>
      <p>Alright, Charlotte, that’s enough clutch wins for the week, ya hear?</p>
      <p>The Hornets are coming off consecutive wins that came down to the wire. On Friday, it was a <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/285714/malik-monk">Malik Monk</a> buzzer-beater, followed by a Devonte Graham game-winner with two seconds left the following night. Raptor fans don’t need reminders about Charlotte winning games at the buzzer!</p>
      <p>With Nicolas Batum and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296777/michael-kidd-gilchrist">Michael Kidd-Gilchrist</a> missing all but three games combined this season, coach <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296677/lebron-james">James</a> <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/244073/james-borrego">Borrego</a> has had to get creative with his lineups. As recent victories are proving, the back court of Graham and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/257535/terry-rozier">Terry Rozier</a> is having positive effects on both players. Unfortunately, all positive signs are on the offensive end. Defensively, they’re smaller and easier for opponents to pick on.</p>
      <p>If we take away those two fluke wins (yes, I’m still bitter), the Raptors had won the previous five matchups. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296763/kemba-walker">Kemba Walker</a> and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296767/jeremy-lamb">Jeremy Lamb</a> are not walking through that door. Instead, Charlotte’s front court includes a Zeller, a Bridges, a Williams, and a Hernangomez... and I honestly don’t know if they’re the better or worse versions of their last name!</p>
      <h4>Fun Fact That May Only Interest Me</h4>
      <p>Hornets owner Michael Jordan purchased the team for $180 million in 2010. The team is currently valued at $1.5 billion. Say what you will about how poorly this franchise has been run, but MJ’s the one laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
      <h4>Prediction</h4>
      <p>Toronto’s offence is average at best (14th in ORTG and 13th in scoring) and has struggled at times in <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296653/kyle-lowry">Lowry</a> and Ibaka’s absence. Thankfully, Charlotte has a bottom-ten defence (DRTG and points allowed) while also turning the ball over at a bottom-ten rate. Those turnovers should fuel the league’s best transition offence into some easy points. I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/276639/pascal-siakam">Pascal Siakam</a> is absolutely going to cook (Dwayne) Bacon. <b>Toronto prevails easily over Charlotte, 120-108.</b></p>
      <h3>November 20 vs. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/orlando-magic"><b>Orlando Magic</b></a></h3>
      <p>In the latest episode of Open Gym, Terence Davis is taken to a sneaker convention. He interacts with some of the fans and eventually plays a game of knockout with a few lucky participants (spoiler alert: he didn’t win). What’s worse than losing a game of knockout to a random fan? How about spraining your ankle at a similar event? That’s exactly what happened to <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/285695/jonathan-isaac">Jonathan Isaac</a>.</p>
      <p>The Magic unveiled their new Nike City Edition jerseys on Thursday night, after which <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299517/jonathan-isaac">Isaac</a> and his teammates interacted with fans while hanging out near an area with a court and hoop. Apparently <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/330936/jonathan-isaac">Isaac</a>, who had sprained that same ankle in his rookie season, did not tie his shoes, nor was he wearing his ankle brace.</p>
      <p>It’s an unfortunate break for Orlando, as Isaac has lived up to all the pre-season hype with outstanding shooting splits (49.5% / 39.5% / 91.3%) and sublime defence (second in blocks with 2.8 per game). As one of the rare defenders with success against <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/319735/pascal-siakam">Siakam</a>, Isaac’s progress with his ankle will go a long way in helping Orlando in this matchup.</p>
      <h4>Fun Fact That May Only Interest Me</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/297122/nikola-vucevic">Nikola Vucevic</a> and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/246144/aaron-gordon">Aaron Gordon</a> — you know, the Magic’s two best players — shot a combined 2-for-19 from the field and scored seven points total during the team’s earlier meeting on October 28. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/297125/nikola-vucevic">Vucevic</a> was so ineffective that coach <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/99614/steve-clifford">Steve Clifford</a> kept him on the bench for the final 15+ minutes. Vooch is still seeing <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/297139/marc-gasol">Marc Gasol</a> in his nightmares!</p>
      <h4>Prediction</h4>
      <p>Orlando has one of the worst offences — 29th in points per 100 possessions, 29th in FG% on open threes; 28th in free throw rate - but one of the best defences (#1 in opponents PPG). If Isaac is anything less than 100% (or if he doesn’t play at all), that’s a win for the Raptors. With Toronto missing some offensive weapons, and both teams firmly entrenched as top-5 defences, this promises to be a low-scoring affair. At least Toronto has some semblance of an offence. <b>Raptors make it two in a row this season against the Magic, winning 98-95.</b></p>
      <h3>November 23 @ <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/atlanta-hawks"><b>Atlanta Hawks</b></a></h3>
      <p>With up-and-comer <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/285720/john-collins">John Collins</a> suspended due to violating the NBA’s Anti-Drug policy, the Hawks are currently fielding a front court of <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/297230/alex-len">Alex Len</a> (who can’t play defence), <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/276626/damian-jones">Damian Jones</a> (who can’t play offence), <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/331012/bruno-fernando">Bruno Fernando</a> (who needs more seasoning in the G-League), and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/246291/jabari-parker">Jabari Parker</a> (yes, he is their crunch-time five).</p>
      <p>In the back court, we already know about <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299935/trae-young">Trae Young</a> and his amazing talents. He’s averaging 26.6 points and 8.8 assists. Those numbers were achieved by LeBron two seasons ago, and also by <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296575/james-harden">James Harden</a> and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296802/russell-westbrook">Russell Westbrook</a> the season before. But before those three, you’d have to go all the way back to the ‘72-’73 season with Tiny Archibald getting those numbers.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Unfortunately for Trae, Atlanta doesn’t have a second initiator. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/331058/cam-reddish">Cam Reddish</a> is too young and inexperienced. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299933/kevin-huerter">Kevin Huerter</a> is out for two weeks with rotator cuff issues. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296639/evan-turner">Evan Turner</a> is... Evan <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299540/evan-turner">Turner</a>.</p>
      <h4>Fun Fact That May Only Interest Me</h4>
      <p>With seven straight wins in this matchup, Toronto has a chance to tie the overall series with Atlanta. The Hawks currently own a 45-44 edge head-to-head. It’s been a long road back after the Raptors lost the first 12 games against Atlanta.</p>
      <h4>Prediction</h4>
      <p>Toronto is number one in the league in opponent’s FG% and number two in opponent’s two-point FG%. Where they struggle, is beyond the arc, ranking 23rd in 3PT FG made and 28th in 3PT FG attempted. Luckily, Atlanta isn’t a threat beyond the arc. The Hawks are 29th in 3PT FG% and two of their best non-Trae-Young bombers are Huerter and Collins. Toronto should win this fairly easily, 122-107. What will keep this interesting is a) <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/295673/vince-carter">Vince Carter</a> and b) watching <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/319732/fred-vanvleet">VanVleet</a> defend Young.</p>
