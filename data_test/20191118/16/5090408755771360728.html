      <p>If you’re sick, sleep is an important part of recovery. But upper respiratory infections, like the flu, come with a slew of <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-are-the-symptoms-of-the-flu">nasty symptoms</a> including a stuffy nose.</p>
      <p>No matter the cause of your sniffles, there’s no denying they make sleeping a challenge.</p>
      <p>“Breathing through your nose comes naturally, and when you have to breathe through your mouth, especially while sleeping, it gets dry,” says Danh Ngo, an osteopathic doctor at the <a href="https://yafferuden.com/">Medical Offices of Manhattan</a>.</p>
      <p>Most often, a stuffy nose happens because the blood vessels within your nose swell up, which causes excess fluid to pool in your nasal tissues.</p>
      <p>“This engorgement of the tissues generally leads to nasal obstruction,” Ngo adds, “which is why we get that stuffed up sensation.”</p>
      <p>And typically, that nasal obstruction comes with other side effects that make it harder to sleep, including sinus pressure, headaches, cough, and ear pain.</p>
      <h3>How to sleep with a stuffy nose</h3>
      <p>First, think position. Sleeping on your back is your best option when you’ve got the sniffles, says Lina Velikova, MD, at <a href="https://disturbmenot.co/">Disturb Me Not</a>. “Lying on the side might make one or both nostrils completely congested.”</p>
      <p>The goal is to allow your mucus to run down and out overnight, instead of clogging up your airways and sinuses. You can help make this happen by adding an extra pillow to elevate your head, and then “gravity will do the rest,” Velikova says.</p>
      <p>Try running a humidifier in your bedroom as well. “The moist air will make the mucus in your airways runnier and more comfortable to get out,” she adds. Taking a hot shower before bed or, once you’re in bed, resting a hot towel over your forehead and sinuses can help too. “The warmth will widen your pathways and help the mucus get loose a bit,” Velikova says.</p>
      <p>Finally, consider taking medications to ease your symptoms. Ngo recommends an antihistamine or decongestant before bedtime, or placing nasal strips on your nose to open the passageways for easy drainage.</p>
      <p>Now, sleep alone won’t loosen up a clogged nose, but getting rest is important, especially if you’re dealing with an infection.”Sleeping, staying hydrated, and eating nutritious food are all essential to getting over a cold and getting rid of a stuffy nose for good,” Ngo says.</p>
