      <p>Popular podcast player Castro is out today with a great update with the headlining feature of Watch Streaming. Watch Sync is also new which loads your favorite podcasts on your Apple Watch both automatically and with a manual option to give customers several ways to listen even when away from iPhone.</p>
      <p>Watch Streaming and Watch Sync for Castro Podcast Player debuted today with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241">version 2019.14 in the App Store</a>.</p>
      <p>Streaming gives Apple Watch users total freedom to listen to podcasts away from iPhone without having to worry whether episodes have been downloaded.</p>
      <p>For the Watch Sync feature, podcasts will download with Castro when Apple Watch is on WiFi and doesn’t have to be on the charger. However, the developers note that they will sync faster when charging.</p>
