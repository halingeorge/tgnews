      <h1>Google starts shipping Stadia Founder’s Edition, invite code coming tomorrow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:37:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Google this morning started shipping Stadia Founder’s Edition. As the game streaming service does not launch until 9 AM PT <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/15/google-stadia-launching/">tomorrow</a>, Stadia Codes are not being emailed until tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Those that pre-ordered during the Stadia Connect livestream on June 6th are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dy5mm3/final_verification_i_saw_my_shipping_dates_go/">starting</a> to receive their “Your Google Store order has shipped” email. It will include final delivery guidance and the ability to “Track Shipment” by carrier. Google <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/17/google-store-stadia-charge/">began charging</a> payment methods over the weekend, while others encountered <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/17/some-stadia-founders-edition-pre-orders-cancelled/">some issues with that step</a>.</p>
      <p>Oddly, the first shipping reports are from buyers that ordered in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dy2pvu/my_stadia_founders_edition_shipped/">July</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dy2m8x/my_order_shipped_i_havent_received_my_signup_code/">September</a>. As of this morning, there are no reports of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dy4rpe/fellow_canadians_whats_happening_with_your_fe/">Canadian</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dy4lrj/anybody_from_germany_here_did_your_order_get/">European</a> customers getting their units shipped yet.</p>
      <p>Gamers that are scheduled to receive Founder’s Edition on Tuesday will get their Stadia Code to activate the service following the 9 AM launch. All others will get the 16-digit invite right after an order has shipped. Once you receive the code, enter it into the Stadia app for Android or iOS, and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/13/stadia-founders-names-alphanumeric-changed-later/">claim your Stadia Name</a>.</p>
      <p>The three-months of Stadia Pro included with the bundle lets you play games in 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. This is the highest quality offered by Google, while <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/06/06/google-stadia-free-base-tier/">free Stadia Base</a> next year is capped at 1080p.</p>
      <p>Both Editions come with a Stadia Controller that includes a USB-C to USB-A cable and power adapter, as well as the Chromecast Ultra. The streaming dongle that connects to your TV features a plug with built-in Ethernet port.</p>
      <p>The Founder’s Controller is a limited-edition Night Blue, while the Premiere is Clearly White, though both have Stadia’s orange accents underneath the thumbsticks. Also included in the first bundle is a Buddy Pass with three-months of Pro and ability to choose your Stadia Name with Founder’s Badge.</p>
