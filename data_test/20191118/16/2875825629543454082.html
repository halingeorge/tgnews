      <p>Boxing star Lawrence Okolie has been filmed sat with a gun in front of him whilst he partied in the United States.</p>
      <p>Rising prospect Okolie, a Rio 2016 Olympian mentored by friend Anthony Joshua, is currently enjoying some down time in Los Angeles after winning the European cruiserweight title with a stoppage win over Yves Ngabu on October 26.</p>
      <p>The trip has been broadcast by Okolie and friends on social media, with one member of the group, using the account gurdasgold93, posting an <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> story showing the boxer and another friend laughing around a table featuring a gun amongst a number of objects.</p>
      <p>A large gold chain and watch are also seen on the table along with some playing cards, although Okolie does not handle the object.</p>

      <p>Sources close to the boxer say the gun belonged to a security guard hired by the group for the night after they had purchased jewellery in the area earlier in the day.</p>

      <p>He was pictured in a California nightclub earlier in the evening as he enjoys some time away from the gym as he eyes a world title shot in 2020.</p>
      <p>Okolie, who turned professional under Matchroom in January 2017 and is managed by Anthony Joshua's company, has won all of his 14 bouts including 11 stoppage wins.</p>

      <p>He has regularly been used as a sparring partner by close friend Joshua, but has not featured in his Sheffield training camp ahead of his rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>The 6ft5 Londoner poses a different threat to the shorter Ruiz, prompting Joshua to draft in a number of new sparring partners such as Dereck Chisora and two Americans ahead of the fight.</p>
