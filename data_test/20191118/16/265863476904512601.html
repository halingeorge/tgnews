      <h1>BravoCon Ends With A Bang And Leaves Andy Cohen Stunned</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:04:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author">Suzy Kerr</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/andy-cohen-announces-new-housewife-franchise-at-bravocon-which-city-did-producers-choose-341552/">Andy Cohen</a> and the Bravo network just wrapped up the first ever BravoCon in New York City, and the three-day convention ended with a bang. While numerous Bravolebrities were on stage in front of a packed house filled with Bravo superfans to wrap up the event, <i>Million Dollar Listing New York</i> star Fredrik Eklund walked across the stage and gave Cohen a passionate french kiss that put the audience in a frenzy and left Cohen stunned.</p>
      <p>Bravo’s <i>Watch What Happens Live</i> Instagram page shared a video clip of the kiss, and it began with Eklund – dressed in silver suit and a black baseball cap – standing in a line of Bravolebrities on stage. Then, Eklund quickly walks over to Cohen and plants the wet kiss while the audience roared.</p>

      <p>When Eklund walked away, Cohen’s eyes were the size of golf balls and he had a smirkish grin on his face while standing completely still. At the same time, Eklund couldn’t stop smiling.</p>
      <p>“OMG!!! What a way to end #BravoCon! 💋 #WWHL,” read the video caption.</p>
      <p>In the comments section, the BravoTV Instagram page wrote, “Be still our heart! 😍.”</p>
      <p>While Eklund is happily married to artist Derek Kaplan, it appears he got a temporary hall pass for the event and it was all in good fun.</p>
      <p>Eklund and Kaplan have been married for six years and are the parents of twins, a son named Fredrik Jr. and a daughter named Mila. Eklund’s husband recently posted a pic of the Swedish real estate broker with his kids, and he wrote in the caption, “Home is where the heart is.”</p>
      <p>Eklund and Kaplan tied the knot in February 2013 on Little Palm Island in the Florida Keys, and they welcomed their twins via surrogate in November 2017.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Cohen welcomed his son Benjamin via surrogate, and the 51-year-old has been documenting his life as a single dad on Instagram. His posts with baby Benjamin have been so popular, <i>People Magazine</i> recently named Benjamin the “cutest baby alive.”</p>
      <p>The first-ever BravoCon was a massive success, despite the high ticket prices and the extremely long lines. Andy Cohen wrapped up the weekend with a special taping of <i>Watch What Happens Live</i>, along with 77 Bravolebrities, including Lisa Vanderpump, Teresa Giudice, and Kenya Moore.</p>
      <p><i>Watch What Happens Live</i> airs Sunday through Thursday nights on Bravo.</p>
