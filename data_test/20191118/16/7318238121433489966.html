      <p>A 15-year-old girl and a lorry driver died after a bridge collapsed into a river in southwestern France on Monday, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The 150 metre-long suspension bridge in Mirepoix-sur-Tarn, near Toulouse, collapsed as a lorry, a car and possibly a van were crossing, the local prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>"This is the final death toll and no one else is missing," Mayor Eric Oget told AFP news agency late on Monday.</p>
      <p>The body of the lorry driver was found in the river around 10pmCET, Oget added.</p>
      <p>According to local authorities, at least five people were injured, including two firefighters involved in the rescue operation.</p>
      <p>Television images showed one car nose-down in the water, with only its rear lights and bumper above the surface.</p>

      <p>The mother of the deceased teenager was among three people rescued from the water, the prosecutor added.</p>
      <p>The Environment Ministry said in a statement that the specific causes of the accident were still "unknown."</p>
      <p>The bridge was limited to 19-tonne vehicles. Mirepoix-sur-Tarn-Mayor Eric Oget told French network BFMTV that the lorry may have been above the authorised limit.</p>
      <p>"One witness apparently said that a heavyweight was engaged on the bridge. Was this truck weighing more than 19 tonnes? I do not know," Oget said.</p>
      <p>The bridge was inspected every six years and had shown no sign of structural weakness at its last inspection in 2017, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a press conference.</p>
      <p>Senators last year called for more money to check and repair bridges across France after the collapse of a motorway viaduct in Genoa, Italy, killed 43 people.</p>
