      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- A running club in Virginia gathered 175 people to run in Tyrannosaurus Rex costumes for an annual event and a Guinness World Record attempt.</p>
      <p>The Richmond Road Runners Club said the second annual Richmond T. Rex Run was held Sunday, one day after the Anthem Richmond Marathon, and<a href="https://www.wric.com/community/positively-richmond/richmond-t-rex-run-returns-for-its-second-year/"> a total 175 people</a> donned dinosaur costumes and took a run through Dorey Park in Henrico County.</p>
      <p>"When you hear about T-Rexes, you think about running around a park, and that excites people is what I think makes Richmond, Richmond," Chris Mason, social media liaison for the club, <a href="https://wtvr.com/2019/11/17/richmond-t-rex-run-video-dorey-park-henrico/">told WTVR-TV</a>. "So it's good to see and feel this energy."</p>
      <p>The club said the run, which raised money for charity Shood, managed to attract 175 runners, but fell short of their goal of 244, which would have set a new Guinness record.</p>
      <p>The runners vowed to break the Guinness record at next year's event.</p>
