      <h3>Multiple peer-reviewed studies have looked at the scientific literature and concluded that at least 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming.</h3>
      <p>Climate scientists have given us clear warnings that we must act urgently to avoid widespread catastrophe. As such, it is unacceptable and dangerous to have members of our Legislative Assembly calling climate change a hoax or saying that those who recognize the scientific consensus “can go back to the Flat Earth Society,” while dismissing those concerned about climate change as “the end-of-the-world-crowd.”</p>
      <p>However, those are <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/mandryk-moe-may-be-listening-to-too-many-angry-backbenchers-offering-little">recent comments from Sask. Party MLAs Warren Michelson and Hugh Nerlien</a>.</p>
      <p>I can understand members of the public being confused about climate change, given that companies have poured millions of dollars into deceiving people. The misinformation and manipulation of the climate change denial movement has now been well documented.</p>
      <p>Nerlien and Michelson are not simply members of the public, though. As MLAs, they are responsible to respect the rights of everyone in our society, including the rights of the children who will live with the consequences of their actions.</p>
      <p>We cannot afford to have our climate policies being determined by those who get their scientific information from conspiracy theory websites. Their remarks present a clear call to look seriously at Sask. Party climate policies. How could those policies possibly be sufficient if climate change deniers feel at home in that party and if the party has not even denounced their remarks?</p>
