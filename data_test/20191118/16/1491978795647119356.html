        <i>Cyril McGuinness collapsed as police searched address in Derbyshire, inquest hears</i>
      </p>
      <p>A convicted criminal considered a key suspect in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/15/the-untouchables-ireland-horrified-by-brutal-mafia-style-abduction">kidnapping and torture of a Northern Ireland businessman </a>died from a suspected “cardiac event” after being handcuffed during his arrest, an inquest has heard.</p>
      <p>Cyril McGuinness, known as “Dublin Jimmy”, was seen to smoke three cigarettes and drink a cup of tea while sitting on a sofa following his arrest at around 7am in the Buxton area of Derbyshire on 8 November.</p>
      <p>Chesterfield coroner’s court was told McGuinness, who “already had a diseased heart”, collapsed 60-90 minutes later at the address on Rockfield Road and was pronounced dead at around 10am.</p>
      <p>Police called an ambulance and attempted resuscitation immediately but the 54-year-old died almost three hours after his arrest.</p>
      <p>The raid was part of a co-ordinated series of search operations, mainly focused on the Irish border area, linked to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/06/businessman-speaks-of-abduction-and-torture-by-gang-on-irish-border">brutal attack on the Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) director Kevin Lunney</a> in September.</p>
      <p>Lunney, 50, was abducted outside his home near Derrylin, Co Fermanagh, and taken to a horsebox across the border, where he was savagely beaten.</p>
      <p>His attackers broke his leg, sliced his fingernails and face with a Stanley knife, carved QIH on his chest, and doused the father of six in bleach.</p>
      <p>The attack was the most serious in a five-year campaign of intimidation targeting the companies and directors that now control the business portfolio built up by the fallen tycoon Seán Quinn, once Ireland’s richest man.</p>
      <p>The opening of the inquest on Monday was told “no trauma” had led to McGuinness’s death and it was likely that he had died as a result of a cardiac event due to an “already diseased heart”.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence at the inquest on Monday, DS Steve Simmons said the death had been automatically referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p>
      <p>Outlining the events leading up to McGuinness’s death, Simmons said: “The circumstances are that Derbyshire police attended an address in Buxton at the request of the Police Service of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
      <p>“Mr McGuinness was arrested at about 7am, was placed in handcuffs, and approximately an hour to an hour and a half later he collapsed.</p>
      <p>“During that time there was a search of his property.”</p>
      <p>The senior coroner for Derby and Derbyshire, Dr Robert Hunter, told the officer it was his understanding that McGuinness “was sat on the sofa and had three cigarettes and a cup of tea”.</p>
      <p>Simmons added: “Police present began resuscitation straight away and contacted the ambulance service.</p>
      <p>“Mr McGuinness was pronounced dead at 9.55am.”</p>
      <p>Hunter adjourned the inquest until the conclusion of the IOPC investigation.</p>
