      <h1>Dad shares 10-year-old daughter’s ridiculous $10,000 Christmas list </h1>

      <p>Santa might have to take out a loan to cover one girl’s exorbitant Christmas wish list.</p>
      <p>An over-the-top letter of gift requests has gone viral after a father in Los Angeles shared it with his followers. The list includes 26 presents, including an iPhone 11, a “new” MacBook air, a Chanel purse, Gucci slides, a pet rabbit, Air Pods, a GoPro and $4,000 — without any explanation of intention for the cash.</p>
      <p>“My 10-year-old daughter must be out of her mind with this Christmas list,” the father, with the Twitter handle @A_Johnson412, <a href="https://twitter.com/a_johnson412/status/1194689352992903169">wrote in a tweet</a> with over 124,000 likes so far.</p>
      <p>Some on social media were as shocked as dad, and claimed she needed “to be taught the true meaning of Christmas.”</p>
      <p>“It’s not about getting presents and being greedy. It’s about loving your fellow man and woman, and giving of your self, and helping the less fortunate,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Laurie70661762/status/1196377834995847168">they wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>However many actually praised the young woman’s lavish taste.</p>
      <p>“She knows exactly what she wants and how to ask for it. Love it,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ledarose_/status/1195072761045159939">wrote one fan</a>.</p>
      <p>“An alarm clock, Gucci slides and some laundry detergent? Mama has range and her priorities in check!” <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsKamillah/status/1195024978674098176">said another</a>.</p>
      <p>The outlandish list also includes some hilarious spelling errors, such as a request for “asenchal oil” and “julery,” plus other bizarre appeals, including glue and food coloring. With those ingredients in mind, <a href="https://twitter.com/queer_hellenic/status/1195156748618715137">some followers determined</a> she has plans to make slime — a mixture that renders a gooey pudding for kids to play with.</p>
      <p>But it was the most mysterious ask of all that seemed to capture social media.</p>
      <p>“WTH she gone do with $4,000[?]” <a href="https://twitter.com/DeawnaKMarie/status/1194997115853922304">one asked</a>.</p>
      <p>“I was thinking this wasn’t so bad until I got to the $4,000!!” <a href="https://twitter.com/angie__pangiee/status/1195063738526846978">another added</a>.</p>
