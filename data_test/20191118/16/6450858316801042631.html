      <h2>No headphone jack? No problem. Apple's AirPods and the best alternatives are true wireless earbuds to save the day.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:49:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Martin</a></address>
      <p>Not many phones have headphone jacks any more and the popularity of Apple's AirPods means that true wireless earbuds are everywhere. We've reviewed and ranked the best earphones you can get including the likes of Sony, RHA, Cambridge Audio and more.</p>
      <p>We're focusing on what are known as 'true wireless' earbuds here – ie not ones that are attached to each other with a cable that hangs on your neck like the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/headphones/google-pixel-buds-review-3668266/">Google Pixel Buds</a> or <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/headphones/bo-beoplay-h5-wireless-earphones-review-3643948/">B&amp;O Beoplay H5</a> - aka neckbuds.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for general wireless headphones then we have a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/audio/best-wireless-headphones-of-2018-3661901/">dedicated chart for that</a> which includes on- and over-ear headphones. </p>
      <p>In terms of wireless earbuds, you're going to have to spend a fair amount to get a decent pair. This is because there's a lot of technology packed into tiny headphones. Since the category is very new, prices won't come down for a while – the average price for a well-known brand is £200/$200.</p>
      <p>Make sure you check out our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/audio/best-headphones-deals-3665740/">best headphone deals</a> article for the top bargains right now.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking, the earbuds from different manufacturers are very similar. The headphones connect to your phone (or other devices) and each other over Bluetooth and tend to have playback controls on at least one earbud.</p>
      <p>You'll get a few hours of battery life (there's not much space for the battery) and the carry case will handily charge them up, normally a few times over.</p>

      <h3>Should I buy wireless headphones now or wait for Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year, and in 2019 takes place on <b>29 November</b>. We're already seeing some great consumer tech deals and expect them to continue right into January, with <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday deals</a> followed by <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/gadget/best-cyber-monday-deals-3667890/">Cyber Monday deals</a>, Christmas deals, Boxing day deals and then we've got the January sales.</p>
      <p>That's both good and bad, of course, because how do you know that a product won't drop in price the very next week? The truth is you can never be entirely sure, but we're now close enough to the main event that many retailers have already begun their Black Friday sales. Of the big UK retailers, Currys has started its <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3673682-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsearch-keywords%2Fxx_xx_xx_xx_xx%2F-why_wait-%2Fxx-criteria.html">Why Wait? sale</a>, guaranteeing that products won't drop any further in price for Black Friday, while <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Friday-Deals/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;node=161428031&amp;ascsubtag=06-3673682-11-0000000">Amazon</a> has a range of Black Friday Countdown deals, with its main event starting on 22 November. </p>
      <p>They aren't the only ones, and we've been busy hunting down the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/audio/best-headphones-deals-3665740/">best headphones deals</a> so that you don't have to. While prices may go down further for Black Friday, some discounts will also end sooner, so unless you're sure that a product will be discounted it's always best to take a deal at face value: if you think the product is worth that amount of money, go for it. Sometimes it doesn't pay to hold out for something that will never happen.</p>

        <p>At they're affordable price compared to the big name rivals out there, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 wireless earbuds should be lacking in a few areas but they're really not.</p>
        <p>They might not have the most striking design but they're lightweight and comfortable. The buttons can handle a whole range of functions once you learn the system, too.</p>
        <p>More importantly, there's excellent battery life on offer here combined with top sound quality so what more could you want? Perhaps noise cancelling but not at this price.</p>

          <p>Simply put, the RHA TrueConnect are one of the best pairs of wireless earbuds we've tested.</p>
          <p>Although they don't have active noise cancelling like the Sony WF-1000X, the comfortable and efficient seal provides excellent noise isolation instead. This means they're cheaper and don't suffer from dropouts either.</p>
          <p>Add in a whopping 25 hours battery life via the charging case, IPX5 splash resistance and top-notch audio quality and this is the pair to beat.</p>

            <p>With great noise cancelling and the ability to tweak everything, including the touch key functions, in the companion app and use Siri or Google Assistant hands-free, they're a great buy.</p>

              <p>They have arrived a bit later than the competition but Libratone has managed to create a very tempting pair of true wireless earbuds thanks to a nice balance of price, features and sound quality.</p>
              <p>Importantly, the Track Air+ offer noise-cancelling which is very rare for this type of headphone, and at a lower price than Sony. Build and audio performance are good but look to RHA and Cambridge Audio if noise-cancelling isn't a must.</p>
              <p>The app could do with a couple of improvements but overall we're pretty impressed.</p>

                <p>AirPods have always been good, but the Pro model makes them great. Apple has done this by improving the design and therefore fit and comfort for starters.</p>
                <p>They're also very fuss-free thanks to easy pairing, plus automatic pause and off. Then there's the way they maintain a solid connection and have decent active noise cancelling, which is still a feature quite rare on wireless earbuds. </p>
                <p>While we welcome these improvements and new features, they're expensive and really should offer better sound quality at this price. Look to the regular <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/headphones/apple-airpods-2-3700979/">AirPods</a> if you need something cheaper.</p>

                    <p>Despite offering incredible audio quality and a great fit (thanks to the inclusion of a variety of eartips and O-hooks), the smart features of the earbuds fail to work most of the time - even when it comes to fairly basic tasks, like turning on automatically when being taken out of the case.</p>
                    <p>But despite the dumb smarts, the design, audio quality and cheap price-tag make these a highly-desireable pair of wireless earbuds. </p>

                      <p>They lack the active noise cancellation of the Sony WF-1000X and the buttons are badly placed so you have to be careful not to push them too far into your ears, but other than that they are an excellent choice.</p>

                          <p>The Galaxy Buds are in the middle of the wireless earbud pack. They're better and cheaper than the older IconX headphones but still aren't perfect.</p>
                          <p>We like the comfortable and lightweight design which is suitable for general listening or running. There are also some handy features including an Ambient Sound mode, sensors and touch controls.</p>
                          <p>However, the sound quality isn't as good as rivals and if you have an iPhone you're best off steering clear with no Galaxy Wearable app to access those aforementioned features.</p>
