      <h1>“Lock Me Out” is a more powerful version of Digital Wellbeing’s Focus Mode [Giveaway]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:11:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/curb-android-smartphone-addiction-lock-me-out/">we highlighted an app</a> called “Lock Me Out” that aimed to help reduce your smartphone use. Since then, “digital wellbeing” has become a big part of every smartphone platform, and Google has even made it mandatory for OEMs to include in their software. That doesn’t make third-party alternatives useless, though, as they may still offer features that aren’t available in the stock software. That’s why Lock Me Out is still under active development and has received many updates since we first covered it, and to celebrate the latest release, the developer is offering <b>promo codes for XDA readers</b>.</p>
      <p>Google <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/digital-wellbeing-focus-mode-schedules-breaks/">recently added a “Focus Mode”</a> to its own Digital Wellbeing app, and Lock Me Out is essentially a more powerful version of that feature. But that’s not all it does. There are three lockout modes to choose from: blocked apps, allowed apps, and lock screen only. You can also setup lockouts based on location, screen time, opened apps, and more. If you require some hardcore enforcement of lockouts, <i>you can even require payment to get out</i>.</p>
