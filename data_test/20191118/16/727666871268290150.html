      <p>Luda is the subject of class at GSU, so the rap star decided to unexpectedly drop in on the students.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Rapper Ludacris recently surprised students at Georgia State University by stopping by to check out a course dedicated to his career as an entertainer.</p>
      <p>The rap star is the subject of a new College of Law class exploring the business contracts that shaped his professional life.</p>
      <p>He decided to see what it's all about for himself by heading back to school to pay attorney Mo Ivory and her students a special visit.</p>
      <p>Ludacris has since shared video footage of the experience on Instagram and marveled at how far he had come.</p>
      <p>"One of the most Humbling Experiences of my Entire Life!!" he exclaimed in the video caption.</p>
      <p>"I had the honor of visiting @georgiastateuniversity to drop in on #TheLegalLifeOfLudacris which is unbelievably the college course being taught at @gsulaw on my career by professor @moivoryshow...</p>
      <p>"Thank you to all the students I met that wanted to learn more about my journey as an artist, actor, producer, entrepreneur, and philanthropist! I Hope This Inspires not only Artists Worldwide, but future Attorneys as Well. Love!"</p>
      <p>The visit was particularly meaningful for Ludacris as he was also a student of GSU during his youth, although he only spent a year there back in 1998 studying music management.</p>
