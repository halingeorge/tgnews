      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/wiley">Wiley</a> has dared <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/dizzee-rascal">Dizzee Rascal</a> to a rap “clash” on London’s streets.</p>
      <p>The ‘Godfather of Grime’ today (November 18) tweeted the <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-dizzee-rascal-7140">‘Boy In Da Corner’</a> artist to spit bars in one of two east London streets. “Dizzee let’s have a clash Roman road or Devon’s road ? You choose,” he wrote, citing areas of Bow where the two rappers grew up and were part of the grime collective Roll Deep.</p>

      <p>The pair have an ongoing feud that dates back to 2003 (<a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/wiley-dizzee-rascal-skepta-beef-explained-2455338">read the full timeline here</a>).</p>
      <p>Last year Wiley released a song called <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/wiley-dizzee-rascal-feud-2404051-2404051#h49sg1XkW0QOsdxP.99">‘Flip The Table’</a> in which he disses Skepta and calls Dizzee a “grime scene quitter”. Earlier this year he <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/wiley-massive-rant-skepta-dizzie-rascal-2391057#hZkwojieSf6azZt0.99">called the pair “frauds” for working together</a>.</p>

      <p>To date, Dizzee is yet to respond to Wiley’s challenge but plenty of fans are goading the pair into meeting. One fan wrote: “Yooooo that would be the dogs bollocks ya know come on!!! @DizzeeRascalwhat yooouuuu saying hahaha” while another said: “Roman Road #E3 where it all started. I will make the pilgrimage back home for this clash!”</p>
      <p>In other news, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/wiley-drops-new-freestyle-track-quick-to-forget-confirms-godfather-3-release-date-2567254">Wiley claimed recently that one of his “closest friends” tried to “bump” him for money</a>. He quickly moved on from the accusation, however, and announced that his fourteenth album, ‘Godfather 3’, will drop on January 1, 2020. The news came with a new freestyle track ‘Quick to Forget’.</p>
