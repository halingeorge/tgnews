      <h3>Xbox Gameplay Chart: Fortnite Finally Topples, Modern Warfare is Number One</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Heidi+Nicholas">Heidi Nicholas</a>, 18 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>You've been here. You've seen it. The lower ranks have shifted and reshuffled. New games have made their debuts and older titles have dropped off the top 40, but every single Gameplay Chart for the last six months or so has had a line in it, somewhere, acknowledging that <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Fortnite/achievements">Fortnite</a> was at no. 1. And still at no. 1. And there again. And the next week. And the week after that. We've had Borderlands 3, Control, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and Gears 5. Each of these releases has caused some shuffling up and down the ranks, but none has managed to shift that Fortnite-shaped shadow looming at the top spot. Until now. Fortnite has officially been knocked out of the number one position it's held for over seven months, and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare/achievements">Modern Warfare</a> was the game to do it.</p>
      <p>Here is the top 40 Xbox Gameplay Chart for the week ending 17 November 2019.</p>

      <p>Modern Warfare has had plenty of issues since it released, such as the footsteps issue and the overpowered 725, but the fact that it's at no. 1, booting out Fortnite, shows just how highly anticipated this game was. Previously, the only game to have managed the same feat was <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Apex-Legends/achievements">Apex Legends.</a> Apex Legends is still in the top 10, and remains at no. 6. this week. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Minecraft/achievements">Minecraft,</a> the other top five giant, is still at no. 3. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Rocket-League/achievements">Rocket League's</a> jumped back into the top 10, and is now at no. 9. Psyonix have detailed a new system coming to the game to replace the Crate loot boxes. Blueprints will be awarded after completing matches online, and will differ from loot boxes in that players will be able to see what the item on the blueprint is before deciding whether to spend Credits to build it. Psyonix will also be giving the first three Rocket League DLC packs for free to all players. Those who have already bought them will be refunded. The game's also getting a winter-themed event for December, titled Frosty Fest. Perhaps these new additions and changes within the game will see Rocket League move further up the chart.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Outer-Worlds/achievements">The Outer Worlds</a> has dropped out of the top ten to no. 11, just a few weeks after its release. The game has scored highly in reviews and garnered a lot of praise, but single-player games don't tend to have a long shelf-life in the Gameplay Chart, with the notable exception of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey – one of the only single-player games to remain on the chart for an extended period, and which only recently fell off. All this shuffling has pushed <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Gears-5/achievements">Gears 5</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Red-Dead-Redemption-2/achievements">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> down a step each, landing at no. 15 and no. 16 respectively. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Star-Wars-Jedi-Fallen-Order/achievements">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> has appeared on the chart following its release last Friday, and is already at no. 15 on the chart despite being three days old. The game has scored well and it's possible we could see it move higher in the next few weeks. Perhaps the game is bringing back some Star Wars nostalgia, because <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Star-Wars-Battlefront-II/achievements">Star Wars Battlefront II</a> has moved up a place since last week, landing at no. 36.</p>

        <figcaption>RAGE 2 makes a return, thanks to its stealth drop into Xbox Game Pass last Friday</figcaption>

      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/RAGE-2/achievements">RAGE 2</a> has also appeared on the charts for the first time, at no. 28. RAGE 2 has recently been added to <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass,</a>, so the sudden influx of players makes a lot of sense. This addition was part of Xbox's announcement at X019, regarding <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39723/xbox-game-pass-reveals-x019">50 games coming to Xbox Game Pass.</a> Plus, RAGE 2 just got its <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39678/rage-2-terrormania-achievements-release-date">TerrorMania expansion,</a> which adds eight new achievements with a total of 195 Gamerscore. Likewise, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Remnant-From-the-Ashes">Remnant From the Ashes</a> has also been made available for Xbox Game Pass, which likely explains its sudden entrance into the charts at no. 32.</p>
      <p>As the year draws to a close, our <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/gamereleases.aspx">upcoming releases calendar</a> shows that there aren't a huge amount of titles releasing which might upset the top ten. This week sees <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Civilization-VI">Civ VI</a> coming to Xbox on November 22nd – the first major Civ release on consoles. December 6th is the console release date for <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Ancestors-Xbox-One">Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey.</a> Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is an ambitious game which has met with mixed reviews since its PC release date, so it'll be interesting to see how it fares with console players.</p>
      <p>Either way, the fact that Modern Warfare has knocked Fortnite off the top spot suggests that the Gameplay Chart is ready for change. What do you think? Will Fallen Order fall in the charts? Will Modern Warfare still be no. 1 next week?

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres — when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
