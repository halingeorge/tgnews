        <b>A Suffolk school's hockey teams have done themselves proud in national and regional tournaments.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Framlingham College's under-11s girls have been crowned East of England champions.</p>
      <p>while the under-13s girls team finished runners up in the national finals.</p>
      <p>Competing in the IAPS National Hockey Finals at Repton in Derbyshire on November 15, the under-13s narrowly lost out in the final to Dean Close School, unfortunately losing their UK champions title from last year.</p>
      <p>However the under-11s took the East of England prize in the In2Hockey tournament held in Ipswich on the same day.</p>
      <p>The team now travel to Haileybury in Hertfordshire for the national finals next week.</p>
      <p>A college spokesman said: "Framlingham College's growing reputation as one of the best hockey playing schools in the country has never been more evident."</p>
