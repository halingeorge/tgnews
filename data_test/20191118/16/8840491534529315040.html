      <p>A Swinford Motors employee was one of the finalists in Toyota Ireland's National Skills Contest 2019.</p>
      <p>Hannah Quinn was a runner-up in the Service Advisor Skills Contest, which was won by Gary Duggan of Kelly's Sales &amp; Service in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal.</p>
      <p>The other runners-up were Michael Bermingham, Tony Burke Motors, Co. Galway; Roy Thomson, McConnell Bros., Co. Waterford; and Aiden Kelliher, Lehane Motors, Co. Cork.</p>
      <p>After the success of the 2017 and 2018 competition, the National Skills Contest expanded to include service advisors alongside technical staff this year.</p>
      <p>“Service advisors play a key role in delivering quality service for customers, and this contest highlights the skills and expertise required,” said Toyota Ireland.</p>
      <p>The contest took place at Toyota HQ, where 20 of the best motoring service advisors in the Toyota Ireland network, including Hannah, competed for the coveted award.</p>
      <p>The first stage of the contest involved an online aptitude assessment and practical skills assessment, from which five service advisors were shortlisted for Service Advisor of the Year Award.</p>
      <p>The final element was for each of the final five candidates to participate in a series of kaizen (continuous improvement) activities, designed to challenge ability and assess customer experience skills.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in the third year of the National Technician Skills Contest, Colin O’Reilly from Brian Geary Sales was named Technician of the Year 2019. The runners-up were Roger Farmer of Kelliher's Garage, Co. Kerry; Derick Bowen of Lehane Motors, Co. Cork; Gerry Carew of Tony Burke Motors, Co. Galway; and Danny O'Shea of Bowlers Garage, Co. Kerry.</p>
      <p>Steve Tormey, chief executive of Toyota Ireland, said: “We’re delighted to host a competition of this nature for our service advisor and technical employees. It’s a great opportunity to showcase the calibre of customer experience of those interacting with Toyota customers throughout the network.</p>
      <p>“The service advisors' skills are tested through an aptitude test followed by a series of kaizen activities. To be placed in the top five is an incredible achievement.”</p>
