      <p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/black-friday-2019/">Black Friday</a> is inching ever closer, and Sony has revealed the PlayStation deals you’ll be able to grab this year. The big seller will likely be this year’s 1 TB PS4 bundle, which includes three top-notch games pre-installed – God of War, The Last of Us Remastered, and Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition. It would have been nice to see Sony drop below the $200 mark (Microsoft is offering an <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-one-150-black-friday-flash-sale/">Xbox One S All-Digital Edition for $150 this year</a>), but still, a console and three great games for $200 is a solid deal. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a bit more power, you’ll be able to get a PS4 Pro for $300 (a $100 savings).</p>

      <p>Here are some of the other <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/11/18/playstation-2019-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-revealed/">PlayStation deals being offered</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PSVR Multi-game Bundle</b> for $199.99 – Includes a PSVR headset, PS Camera, and Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Skyrim VR, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Everybody’s Golf VR, and PlayStation VR Worlds.</li>
        <li><b>PS VR Blood &amp; Truth + Everybody’s Golf Bundle</b> for $249.99 – Includes a PSVR headset, PS Camera, two PS Move controllers, Blood &amp; Truth, and Everybody’s Golf VR.</li>
        <li><a href="https://fave.co/2KwoLSH">PS Gold Headsets</a> for $69.99</li>
        <li><a href="https://fave.co/2NWbdBO">DualShock 4</a> controllers for $39.99</li>
        <li><b>Recent major PlayStation exclusives</b> for $20 – Includes <a href="https://fave.co/2XzASDT">Days Gone</a>,<a href="https://fave.co/2XmSumc"> Spider-Man: Game of the Year Edition</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/348G2ct">MediEvil</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/37hmrsj">Concrete Genie</a>, and <a href="https://fave.co/355EOi6">MLB The Show 19</a>. PlayStation Hits titles will also all be available for only 10 bucks each.</li>
        <li><b>PlayStation Plus yearly subscription</b> 25 percent off</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Not a bad lineup! Again, I feel like Sony could have been just a touch more generous with the hardware deals, but offering almost all their recent first-party offerings (minus Death Stranding) for only $20 bucks apiece is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
      <p>The PlayStation Black Friday deals will be available from November 24 to December 2 at most major retailers. What do you think? See any deals you just can’t pass up?</p>
