      <p>SUN PRAIRIE, Wis. - The city of Sun Prairie is among government entities thinking about providing free child care at its meetings to increase the public's participation.</p>
      <p>Alderwoman Theresa Stevens says it would encourage people, particularly those 24 to 45 who have young children, to participate in the government process. The pilot program would make two child care workers available for each of the 314 city meetings each year at a cost of about $23,000.</p>
      <p>The program will next be considered at the city's budget meeting Tuesday. The State Journal says Madison and Dane County are looking at similar initiatives.</p>
