      <h1>Historic Sunderland power station site set to be revamped by developers</h1>
      <h2>The building was linked to Durham Collieries Power Company and was listed in the 1980s.</h2>

      <p>Part of a historic former power station on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Wearside </a>is set to become a garage and MOT test centre under new plans.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, proposals were lodged for a section of the former coal-fired power station off Philadelphia Lane, near Shiney Row.</p>
      <p>Dating 1906, the building was linked to Durham Collieries Power Company and was listed in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-council">Sunderland City Council </a>planners, the main 'annexe building', also listed, has remained vacant for several years and has fallen into disrepair.</p>
      <p>New plans from applicant Philadelphia Estates Ltd aim to bring the site back into use while conserving its historical features.</p>
      <p>The development will see a host of repair works to masonry, metal, windows, doors and a new roof, the removal of metal stairs and new roller shutters.</p>
      <p>Plans for garage and MOT testing centre were approved by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-council">Sunderland City Council</a> on Wednesday, November 13.</p>
      <p>To allow the works to go ahead, a link building on site will be demolished to provide access to vehicles from the rear.</p>
      <p>A planning report states it is a "unattractive modern structure that detracts from the historic character of the site".</p>
      <p>The report adds: "The proposed adaptation and conversion of the listed former power station annexe will return a vacant listed building into beneficial usage in a manner generally consistent with its conservation, sustaining its significance into the future."</p>
      <p>Under planning conditions, the project must start within three years.</p>
