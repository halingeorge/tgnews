      <h1>Let's Talk About THE MANDALORIAN Chapter 2: The Child, Which Was an Exciting Continuation of The Story!</h1>

      <p>With the weekend behind us, I feel that most of you have already had the opportunity to watch the second chapter of <b><i>The Mandalorian</i></b>, which is called “The Child”. After the end of Chapter 1, I was excited to see how the story would continue, epically with The Mandalorian’s new little companion. Fans have had a lot of questions about this 50-year-old baby Yoda-like character.</p>
      <p>The first episode of this series was enough to sell me on the fact that this series is the best <i>Star Wars</i> story we’ve seen since the original trilogy. While some people are a little more skeptical and waiting to see how the whole series plays out, Chapter 2, which was directed by <b>Rick Famuyiwa</b>, was a great episode that was a perfectly entertaining continuation of the story. It also started to answer some of the questions that arose with the end of Chapter 1.</p>

      <p>While the Yoda-like character looks like a cute little baby, he is very knowledgable and very powerful when it comes to The Force. We get to see him use The Force as a way to help The Mandalorian out of a sticky situation. This act wore the kid out, and The Mandalorian and his new friend Kuiil were left wondering what is going on. This 50-year-old kid is obviously a powerful force to be reckoned with and certain people in the universe know that. While some want him dead, others have other plans for him.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite parts of the episode is when The Mandalorian comes across a gang of Jawas stripping his ship and stealing his stuff. It was a lot of fun watching him violently chase down the Jawas when as they are on the run in their sandcrawler, and in the process he disintegrates a few of them! After the Jawas take him down, Kuiil helps him negotiate a trade to get his stuff back, and that trade involves The Mandalorian acquiring an egg from a large horned beast, which is what what the child eventually helps him with using The Force, allowing The Mandalorian to kill the beast and get the egg.</p>
      <p>Kuiil helps The Mandalorian fix his ship and sends him on his way. I would have actually liked to see Kuiil join him on his journey. I loved that The Mandalorian made the offer, though! It’s okay because I know that more characters are coming that will aid The Mandalorian on his journey and I can’t wait to be introduced to these characters and learn more about them.</p>
      <p>With the child recovered from his exertion of The Force, it’s going to be interesting to see what how The Force will come into play later in the story. Obviously he is powerful and he might be even more powerful in ways than people think. There is speculation that the character from Chapter 1, Doctor Pershing, who is wearing the Kaminoan Clone insignia, might want the Force sensitive child to make clones of it so they have an army of these creatures. Then there’s the question… is The Child already a clone? </p>
      <p>Fans have a lot of questions and I’m excited to see where Chapter 3 ends up taking us! It’s hard having to wait every week to watch these episodes, but in the meantime it’s a lot of fun to talk about and speculate what might happen! I have spoken.</p>
      <p>What are your thoughts on <i>The Mandalorian</i> Chapter 2 and what are some of your theories regarding The Child?</p>
