      <p>Suspected cybercriminals from Turkey have stolen huge amounts of cash in the Indian state of Tripura by cloning devices installed in ATMs, police said on Monday.</p>
      <p>According to police, over 60 customers of different banks in Tripura, including the State Bank of India, have lost millions due to the fraudulent acts of cybercriminals and ATM hackers.</p>
      <p>A similar incident recently occurred in the north-eastern state of Assam.</p>
      <p>Tripura police’s cybercrime officer Sharmistha Chakraborty says that a preliminary probe points towards the involvement of <a href="http://sputniknews.com/world/20191114/1077300583.html">Turkish nationals</a> who withdrew millions of rupees from banks with the help of similar cloning devices to those used recently in Guwahati in the neigbhouring state of Assam.</p>
      <p>We are collecting complaints from bank customers, from various police stations and different bank branches related to stolen cash from ATMs through ATM-cloning devices, the officer told the Indian media agency IANS.</p>
      <blockquote>“Our probe is on. If necessary, we would take help from other agencies of concerned States where similar crimes took place,” the official added.</blockquote>
      <p>Customers have been robbed of nearly $111,520 in the past few days in Tripura, local media reported.</p>
      <p>Nearly 45 complaints have been received from customers, saying that they lost money due to ATM hacking, according to the State Bank of India’s Regional Manager Dibyendu Chowdhury.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, over one-third of <a href="http://sputniknews.com/europe/20190928/1076911038.html">cybercrime</a> cases comprise debit/credit card frauds while ATM card frauds comprise 200-300 cases per month.</p>
      <p>In August, the “<a href="http://sputniknews.com/society/20190129/1071901427.html">dark web</a>” released the first batch of stolen credit card data dumps from an alleged point-of-sale  breach at the US-based gas and convenience store chain Hy-Vee.</p>
