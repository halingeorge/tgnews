      <p>In May of 2019, Diggin’ In The Crates co-founder Diamond D released <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/03/diamond-d-the-diam-piece-2-tracklist-release-date/"><i>The Diam Piece 2</i> </a>album. The 16-track LP features Raekwon, Snoop Dogg, Fat Joe, <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/07/elzhi-diamond-d-i-cant-lose-video/">Elzhi</a>, <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/10/david-banner-diamond-d-bodied-video/">David Banner</a>, and Xzibit, as well as many more that have worked with the Bronx producer/MC/DJ over a career that dates back 30 years.</p>
      <p>Released through his Dymond Mine/EMPIRE, Diamond has been aggressive with the visuals. He released <a href="https://youtu.be/4VZvleVupxg">“Maintaining”</a> featuring Lord Tariq, Peter Gunz, and a-Kash, <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/07/elzhi-diamond-d-i-cant-lose-video/">“I Can’t Lose”</a> featuring Elzhi and Blake Moses, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nofhlGPoio">“Watch Yo Back”</a> featuring Buckshot, General Steele, and Rockness, before <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/10/david-banner-diamond-d-bodied-video/">“Bodied,”</a> featuring David Banner, Big Rec, and Edson Sean. Now comes “Hold Up,” featuring A-F-R-O, Dillon, and onetime <i>Guinness</i> record-holder, Twista.</p>

      <p>When<a href="https://www.afhtv.com/videos/diamond-d-discusses-his-new-album-featuring-styles-p-xzibit-elzhi-more"> speaking to AFH TV earlier this year</a>, Diamond D went into detail about the process of making the record. He said, “For a while, I just had Twista’s verse. So I’m like, ‘Yo, who can I put on here that can at least keep up with Twista?’ I was about to put [the song] on hold for <i>The Diam Piece 3</i>.” Once D’s engineer, Amond Jackson, suggested to add A-F-R-O to the track, he had a change of heart. He adds, “I wasn’t thinking about A-F-R-O, because I already had a solo joint from A-F-R-O that I’m gonna release [on my next album]. Then I said, ‘f*ck it,’ and I just shot it to him. Man, yo, A-F-R-O said as soon as he heard it, he jumped on it. He sent me the vocals maybe two days later. He jumped right on it.” The self-proclaimed <i>“best producer on the mic”</i> went on to say, “In the case with Twista, I just shot him the beat. I said, ‘I don’t really have no concept for the beat at this point. But wherever you take it, whoever I put on there will have to follow your lead.’ That’s all I told him. When I got it back, I was blown away.”</p>
      <p>The video showcases the three MCs spitting gasoline infused freebees while the audience can hear Diamond’s haunting piano keys playing over a strong drum kick. Even though the lyricists are present in their separate hometowns, the video’s transitions complement the artists’ flow in such a way that the viewer may feel that they are in the same space.</p>

      <p>First on the mic is A-F-R-O. “<i>F-R-O in a particular mind / The flow ridiculous/ So inconspicuous / I do it with the pride,</i>” the R.A. The Rugged Man protege begins. “<i>Either I’m ready to prove that even at my level that the fellow flow and skills are incredibly sharp / Hold up, meant to be the head, Don Corleone / Beat em’ dead, feed em’ lead, speak the best audio flow / You don’t know how to party, well then you ought to go home / It gotta be a body the way that my cardio go.</i>” Veteran Dillon, <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2017/10/ready-or-not-dillon-diamond-d-music-video/">who has worked with Diamond in the past</a>, then comes in with the hook.</p>

      <p>The Tung Twista holds nothing back by rhyming, “<i>Locomotion when I get up in the race / I was itching to get up in the place / So I can spit in your face / I was searching for a beat like Diamond D, I was downstairs diggin’ in the crates / Hold up, an Immaculate ni**a from the East Coast; I’m from the Midwest / Just creeping / So let’s just peep it / Twista on a beat by the producer for the video for ‘Best Kept Secret’ / Hold up, even make a lion fear / When I am near / Pioneers is something when I appear / On the track with a veteran / It be something like medicine / And the sh*I be so potent it be giving them diarrhea.</i>”</p>
