      <p>Andre de Ruyter has been appointed as the new group chief executive of struggling state-owned power utility Eskom, minister of public enterprises Pravin Gordhan announced on Monday.</p>
      <p>De Ruyter currently serves as CEO of Nampak, Africa's biggest packaging company, and previously worked for petrochemical group Sasol in a number of senior management positions.</p>
      <p>Gordhan said he has ample experience in the energy sector.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank Mr De Ruyter for not only accepting this position at a difficult time for Eskom, but, given Eskom's current financial situation, also agreeing to a lower compensation package than the position currently pays."</p>
      <p>Eskom chairman Jabu Mabuza has been acting as chief executive of Eskom since Phakamani Hadebe stepped down at the end of July.</p>
