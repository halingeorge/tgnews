      <p>It features elegant tapered legs and a fluted, curved back, giving it a distinct retro Art Deco vibe.</p>
      <p>Part of the new Kirkton House range, it looks just like the designer offerings that are currently on the high street.</p>
      <p>However, at just £59.99, it's a fraction of the price.</p>

      <p>The store added: "With its wooden legs the style will fit in with any décor, while the velvet look and feel of the upholstered seat will encourage you to take the time for some much needed relaxation."</p>
