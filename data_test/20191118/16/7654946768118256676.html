      <p>FedEx CEO Frederick Smith wants to go toe-to-toe with The New York Times over a bombshell report on the shipping giant’s tax bill.</p>
      <p>Smith challenged the Gray Lady’s publisher, AG Sulzberger, and its business editor to a public debate Sunday after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html">the paper revealed</a> how FedEx drove its taxes down to zero.</p>
      <p>“I hereby challenge A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax,” Smith <a href="https://about.van.fedex.com/newsroom/statement-from-frederick-w-smith-chairman-and-ceo-of-fedex-corporation/">said in a statement</a> slamming the Times’s story.</p>
      <p>“The focus of the debate should be federal tax policy and the relative societal benefits of business investments and the enormous intended benefits to the United States economy, especially lower and middle-class wage earners,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Times’s Sunday report identified Smith as the “public face” of FedEx’s lobbying campaign for the tax reform bill President Donald Trump signed into law in 2017.</p>
      <p>The legislation cut FedEx’s effective tax rate from 34 percent in the 2017 fiscal year to 0 percent in 2018 — but the company did not spend more money on new business investments as Smith said it would, according to the Times.</p>
      <p>Smith slammed the story as “distorted and factually incorrect,” though he did not specify what the paper got wrong. He also said the Times itself paid no federal income tax in 2017 and “only $30 million” in 2018.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for The New York Times Company dismissed Smith’s statement as “a stunt and an effort to distract from the findings of our story.”</p>
      <p>“FedEx’s colorful response does not challenge a single fact in our story,” Danielle Roades Ha, the company’s vice president of communications, said in a statement. “We’re confident in the accuracy of our reporting.”</p>
