        <b>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> star Clive Allen has backed Harry Kane to fulfill his ambition of starring in the NFL after his football career comes to an end.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The England captain said earlier in 2019 that becoming a placekicker in the NFL is something he ‘definitely wants to try in 10 or 12 years.’</p>
      <p>Kane is a big fan of American football and suggested that crossing codes would give him the chance to become the ‘greatest sportsman ever.</p>
      <p>The Spurs striker told ESPN: ‘It goes back to that drive to be the best. Even if I download a game on my phone, can I be the best in the world?</p>
      <p>‘If you play in the Premier League and the World Cup and you then play in the NFL, would you then be considered one of the greatest sportsmen ever?’</p>

      <p>Allen knows better than most about what it takes to play both sports, having also played for Spurs and England, and for the London Monarchs in NFL Europe.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old recognises that Kane would have a lot to learn but has backed him to manage the switch.</p>
      <p>‘Former strikers are the ones that can do it well,’ Allen told the Daily Star. ‘Kane has a great interest in it and I wouldn’t be surprised if in years to come he’ll be kicking an NFL football.</p>

      <p>‘Knowing Kane – and having worked with him – I know all about his mentality and attitude.</p>
      <p>I’m sure he could adapt his style to do the job and I wouldn’t put it past him being very successful at it.</p>
      <p>‘It’s also not got the physical demands of soccer – kicking at least – so players can go on a little longer.’</p>
      <p>‘It’s a different technique, certainly from kicking a soccer ball.’The NFL ball is remarkably light and deviates a lot.’The kicking technique is straight leg, locked knee and pointed toe. And where you strike the ball is really important.’It took quite a lot of practice and work for me to hone the skill and make it work.’</p>

      <p>Morten Anderson, who is the NFL record appearance-holder and former kicker, says that Kane could not just jump straight into the NFL, but he could certainly learn.</p>
      <p>‘It is ludicrous to think you can just step in and do it at that level,’ Andersen told Sky Sports. ‘I want the fans to understand that I don’t feel disrespected, but there is more to it than meets the eye.’</p>
      <p>Anderson did offer his services to help Kane with his ambition, though, telling talkSPORT: ‘I don’t think he would have a big learning curve. I would love to work with him. I think that would be fascinating.’</p>
