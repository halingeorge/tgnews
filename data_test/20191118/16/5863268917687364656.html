      <p>ISLAMABAD (APP) - Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Saturday rejected a news story carried by a section of press claiming that the Prime Minister was annoyed at the PTI media team for failing to convey the government performance to people.</p>
      <p>In twitter message, Dr. Firdous Ashiq Awan said that this is totally fake news and a completely concocted story published by a private local news channel. Nothing of this sort was discussed in the meeting, she categorically said.</p>
      <p>“And I would hope after this official denial by me, channel will retract this false story,” she said.</p>
      <p>It was stated earlier that Prime Minister Imran Khan was reportedly annoyed at his social media team over its failure to convey the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government’s performance to the people, private local news channel said after the party held a meeting of its core committee. </p>
