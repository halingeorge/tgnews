      <p>A man claims he found an insect wriggling around inside an unopened packet of couscous, just seconds before he was about to make lunch for his flat mates.</p>
      <p>Lukasz Marzec says he had bought the item from a branch of Morrisons in Stoke on Trent.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old warehouse worker said he was looking at the cooking instructions on the packet when he saw the small "maggot-like" creature inside the packet.</p>
      <p>He then recorded a short clip on his phone.</p>
      <p>Lukasz, who works at Dunelm's distribution centre, told <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/">Stoke on Trent Live</a> : "As soon as I started preparing my meal, I was reading the label on the back and I saw a little dark thing in the corner.</p>

      <p>"I shook the bag and that's when I realised it was still alive. I think there is just the one in there but I didn't want to open the packet to see. You never know, there could be more.</p>
      <p>"I was making chicken with couscous with my housemates and some of our friends were going to come round, but there was no way I was going to cook that. We decided to get a takeaway instead."</p>
      <p>He added: "Initially I thought I would throw it away but then I realised other bags could be affected.</p>
      <p>"It's the first time anything like that has happened to me. If I hadn't have spotted it, it could have ended up in our meal and made us sick. I didn't think it was worth the risk.</p>

      <p>"I will have to wait and see what Morrisons say but I'm not very happy. Hopefully they will come back to me soon."</p>
      <p>Lukasz has now put in an official complaint with Morrisons' head office and is waiting for a response.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Morrisons for comment.</p>
