      <p>The cab driver <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/cab-driver-wanted-for-bronx-stabbing-says-hes-the-victim/">accused of stabbing an alleged fare-beater in The Bronx </a>will turn himself into the NYPD on Monday in the hopes of clearing his name.</p>
      <p>Sandy de Jesus Rodriguez will surrender to detectives in the 46th Precinct in University Heights to speak about the alleged Oct. 13th stabbing of a man inside an apartment building on Webster Avenue near 184th Street.</p>
      <p>De Jesus Rodriguez claims he was defending himself against the man and his girlfriend, who allegedly robbed him of $190 after catching a ride. He said the pair then attacked him when he followed them into the apartment building to get the money back.</p>
      <p>“The only mistake I made was trying to get the $190.00 the female passenger stole from me. I should have taken the loss and drove away but it was hard not bringing food to my table. I hope that they are held responsible for what they did,” said de Jesus Rodriguez in a press release by the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers.</p>
      <p>The cabbie claims it wasn’t the first time he was targeted by the lovebirds. He said the same couple skipped out on a fare four months before the alleged stabbing.</p>
      <p>De Jesus Rodriguez is calling on police to check medical records of the man he is accused of stabbing, which he claims will prove his innocence.</p>
      <p>“I did not hit him or stab him unless he intentionally cut himself to make it like but I did it but I did not cut him in any way,” the cab driver previously told The Post.</p>
