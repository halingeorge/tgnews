      <p>B.C.’s police watchdog has been called to Penticton to investigate the death of a man arrested by RCMP.</p>
      <p>The Independent Investigations Office of B.C. says officers were called on Nov. 8 at 8:40 a.m. to a theft from a store. The suspect resisted arrest and sustained a "minor head injury."</p>
      <p>“He was taken to hospital, which he subsequently left and had to be returned later, again by police,” the IIO said in a news release.</p>
      <p>In hospital, the man’s condition deteriorated and he died six days later, on Nov. 14. The IIO was notified by the BC Coroners Service. </p>
      <p>The Coroners Service is conducting an investigation into the cause of the man’s death, while the IIO has opened a parallel probe into “what role, if any, officers’ actions or inaction may have played into the death of the male.”</p>
      <p>The identity of the man has not been released.</p>
