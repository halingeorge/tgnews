      <h1>See's Blindness Consultant On the Show's Explosive Fight Scenes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:11:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Cynthia Vinney</a></address>
      <p>In the new <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> series <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/see/"><i>See</i></a>, Jason Momoa stars as the leader of the Alkenny tribe. Set 600 years in the future, the series takes place after most of the human race has been wiped out and the people that remain have been left blind. Despite its characters' lack of sight, this world proves to have plenty of opportunities for visceral fight sequences. In the first three episodes alone, the Alkenny tribe engages in a major battle sequence, Momoa’s character takes on a group of men who are threatening his family, and the Witchfinders who roam the land inflict torture on anyone they believe could be harboring sighted heretics.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, this leads to a great deal of action. However, it’s sometimes difficult to discern how accurate and realistic the fight scenes are. In a press conference and round table in support of the show’s release, CBR and other outlets spoke to the cast and blindness consultant Joe Strechay about the show’s dynamic action.</p>

      <p>Hera Hilmar (<i>DaVinci's Demons</i>), who plays Maghra on the series, said that in training to play someone without sight, she learned, “how capable people who are blind and with low-vision are.” Noting “I know maybe it sounds silly,” she observed that she “just didn’t know that you could be as physically, amazingly capable as so many [blind] people are.”</p>
      <p>This capability was reflected in blindness consultant Strechay’s perspective on <i>See</i>’s fight scenes. First, he pointed to how many people with blindness and low-vision have accomplished physical feats most of us could only dream of.</p>

      <p>“There are people who are blind who are judo experts and champions that compete in the Paralympics,” he said. “My buddy, he’s a mountain-climber, he’s summited Mount Everest and the highest peak on each continent.”</p>
      <p>When it came time to execute the fight scenes, Strechay consulted with the stunt team. He said, “The fight coordinator and myself spent some time and I spent some time with some of the other stunt people working on some of the things.”</p>

      <p>He provided some examples of  the things he told the stunt team they should consider when executing action sequences between blind characters. “You can judge… whether [someone’s] going to punch if I’m holding on their right arm or shoulder,” Strechay explained. “I can feel if they’re pulling back their other arm to punch [me]. Now if they don’t pull back and just go it’s harder to judge. Just from their arm I can feel if they’re going to try to kick me. There [are] all kinds of things you can pick up just from getting to know someone’s movements and their body. And we played with that in the show.”</p>
      <p>As with many other aspects of <i>See</i>, great care was taken to ensure that the fight sequences made sense for the world of the series. And Strechay was impressed with the way the actors rose to the challenge. “[Momoa], who did most of his own stunts, and his stunt double, Kim… they were tremendous.”</p>
