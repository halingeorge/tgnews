      <h1>The Official Title Sequence For Marvel's HAWKEYE Series Has Been Released</h1>

      <p>Earlier this year during the big Marvel panel at Comic-Con, the studio showed off the opening title sequence for their Disney+ series <b><i>Hawkeye</i></b>. That animated graphic art sequence has now been released for the rest of you to see.</p>
      <p>This is said to be the official title sequence for the series, but I imagine when the series launches in the Fall of 2021, there will be a different title sequence. I think this is just something that was created to show to the fans at Comic-Con. Regardless, it’s pretty cool and you can check it out below:</p>

      <p><b>Jeremy Renner</b> is set to reprise his role as Clint Barton and <b>Hailee Steinfeld </b>has been offered the role of Kate Bishop, but she has yet to <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/hailee-steinfeld-doesnt-seem-so-sure-about-playing-kate-bishop-in-marvels-hawkeye-series">accept the offer</a>. The fans are really hoping to see her take it.</p>
      <p>There are no details on the story that the series will tell, but we do know that Hawkeye will train Kate to become the badass warrior she was born to be. In the comics, Kate has a high level of skill in archery, sword fighting, and unarmed combat. Kate also possesses a significant stock of fighting weapons.</p>
      <p>The series is set to be released in fall 2021 on Disney+ as part of Marvel’s Phase Four round of releases. All of the Marvel shows that are being produced will tie directly into the MCU movies, and they are being produced by Marvel Studios president <b>Kevin Feige</b>. <i>Mad Men</i> scribe <b>Jonathan Igla </b>is writing the series.</p>
