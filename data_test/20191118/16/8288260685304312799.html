      <p>The temperature is set to plummet in The Black Country overnight – with forecasters warning the mercury could fall to as low as -8C in some parts of the UK.</p>
      <p>Forecasters have even issued a yellow weather warning for freezing fog as the cold snap grips the region from 4am onwards on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>The Met Office say tonight (November 18) could be the coldest night across the UK so far this autumn.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In Wolverhampton and Walsall, the temperature is set to be -1C, while in the Staffordshire Moorlands and Stafford it will be even colder at -2C. Birmingham will also see the temperature fall below zero.</p>
      <p>But a spokesman said the current cold spell may soon come to an end, with temperatures recovering throughout the week and values pushing upwards above average for the time of year with double digits in places.</p>

      <p>Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: “Slow-moving rain returns to the West on Tuesday and to Yorkshire and other parts from Thursday for the rest of the week, with bands of rain.</p>
      <p>“It's cold in the northerly flow. Monday night could be the coldest night of autumn in Scotland and England, exceeding -8.1C in Scotland and down to -6C in northern England.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Snow showers could be seen on higher ground of Scotland, with a bit of snow over northern England.</p>
      <p>“Daytime maximums will be 7-9C for most to start the week, easing to 12C in the South from midweek as the flow turns southerly, but still only 7-10C in the North.</p>
      <p>“It stays unsettled from next weekend onwards, with bands of rain through the following week.”</p>
