      <p>A grieving boyfriend killed himself after being left ‘heartbroken’ by his girlfriend’s suicide, a coroner has found.</p>
      <p>Adam Howarth, 29, was killed by a train six days after Chloe Spencer, 27, was found hanged at home in Wigan, their joint inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Chloe had suffered with mental health problems and a custody battle but showed no signs of suicidal thoughts, Bolton Coroners Court was told.</p>
      <p>The pair started <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> in July 2018 and had an ‘on-off relationship’.</p>
      <p>On 21 June this year, the pair had plans to meet up, but Chloe cancelled at the last minute to meet up with a friend, David McCormick.</p>
      <p>Adam’s mother, Ann Lloyd, told the inquest: ‘The following day Adam unexpectedly received a call from a friend saying she had taken her own life. He was heartbroken.’</p>

      <p>She added: ‘He had plans for the future, he had recently been offered a new job and he planned to meet up with some friends the next day.</p>

      <p>‘When he was asked if he had any suicidal thoughts he kept saying he had to get through the funeral first. I was just thinking “I’ve got time to get him out of this and get him through the grief”.’</p>
      <p>Adam, who planned to carry Chloe’s coffin, ‘seemed quiet but OK’ at a family barbecue on 27 June but was noticed leaving in an upset state by his cousin later on, Ann said.</p>
      <p>The family reported him missing after going out to search for him in vain and were told of his death the next day, she said.</p>
      <p>Chloe’s mother Deborah said her ‘wonderful’ daughter’s mental health had suffered since falling victim to a sexual assault several years before her death.</p>
      <p>She was supposed to sleep at her mother’s house after meeting up with David, but instead collected her keys and went home, the coroner heard.</p>

      <p>Deborah told the inquest: ‘I last spoke to her at 3am on 22 June, 2019. She phoned me but she didn’t seem anxious or depressed during the call. We made arrangements to see each other later that day.</p>
      <p>‘I’m aware Chloe had taken tablets in the past but I believe those were a cry for help and I do not believe this particular incident was a clear indication for Chloe to end her own life.’</p>
      <p>David McCormick told the inquest he and Chloe went for drinks at a pub and bar before going back to her house.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘We just drank and had a laugh and we joked. I went to sleep at about 11.30pm as I was training for a charity fight the next day.</p>
      <p>‘I woke up at about 5am to go to the toilet and I found her.</p>
      <p>‘There’s lots of times I was thinking “what if I had woke up ten minutes earlier” but I just can’t say. It was such a short window. She seemed in a good mood.’</p>

      <p>He said Chloe had told him about her mental health issues and said she was taking medication but ‘she seemed fine’.</p>
      <p>David added: ‘There’s no way in the world I thought she would do it.’</p>
      <p>Tests found alcohol levels just over twice the legal drinking limit in Chloe’s blood as well as traces of cocaine in her system, the coroner heard.</p>
      <p>The court also heard that before his death, Adam had been due to meet mental health experts after a referral by his counsellor, but he was never seen due to staff shortages.</p>

      <p>Det Ch Insp Lee Owen of British Transport Police said there was no indication Adam died in suspicious circumstances but that he believed Adam had tried to jump out of the way of the train at the last minute.</p>
      <p>Coroner Rachel Syed concluded a verdict of suicide for both Adam and Chloe.</p>

      <p>The coroner said: ‘At no point did Chloe disclose to her family, GP or mental health services that she intended to take her own life.</p>
      <p>‘There is no evidence she was researching how to take her own life and this came as a great shock to her family.’</p>
      <p>Deborah said: ‘I would describe Chloe as a beautiful person, a wonderful daughter and sister, but most of all she adored her daughter in the short years she has given some wonderful memories.</p>
      <p>‘We are all deeply distressed by her death.’</p>
