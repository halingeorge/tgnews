      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- For the first time in more than a half-century, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ford_Motor/?tps=1">Ford Motor</a> Company has added to its Mustang lineup -- an electric sport-utility version it says "strikes like forked lightning."</p>
      <p>The American automaker unveiled the Mustang Mach-E on Sunday ahead of its official debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It's Ford's first addition to the Mustang lineup since the iconic ponycar was introduced in 1964.</p>
      <p>Ford said the Mach-E has a range of 300 miles on a single charge and can reach 60 mph in four seconds -- or three seconds, if you have the GT Performance edition. It's scheduled to go on sale late next year.</p>
      <p>"At the first-ever Detroit auto show, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Henry_Ford/?tps=1">Henry Ford</a> said he was working on something that would strike like forked lightning. That was the Model T," CEO <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Bill_Ford/?tps=1">Bill Ford</a> said. "Today, the Ford Motor Company is proud to unveil a car that strikes like forked lightning all over again. The all-new, all-electric Mustang Mach-E.</p>
      <p>"It's fast. It's fun. It's freedom for a new generation of Mustang owners."</p>
      <p>The Mach-E is available in rear- and all-wheel drive versions and can reach 332 horsepower. Ford said the standard all-wheel-drive model can hit 60 mph faster than the base version of the Porsche Macan.</p>
      <p>Ford said it also plans to offer a full-glass roof and animal-free interior. The Mach-E will be built at Ford's Cuautitlan, Mexico, plant.</p>
