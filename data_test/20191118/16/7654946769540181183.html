      <h1>Bill Belichick shows he never forgets with trolling of Lane Johnson</h1>

      <p>Who says Bill Belichick doesn’t read the newspapers, watch TV or have a sense of humor?</p>
      <p>After his team beat the Eagles Sunday in Philadelphia, the Patriots coach delivered a deadpan special as he trolled Eagles tackle Lane Johnson with a read-between-the-lines zinger.</p>
      <p>To review: After the Eagles beat the Patriots in Super Bowl LII two seasons ago, Johnson, on a podcast, tweaked the rigid “Patriot Way,” saying, “I just think that the Patriot Way is a fear-based organization. Obviously, do they win? Hell yes, they win. They’ve won for a long time. Do I think people enjoy [it] and can say, ‘I had a lot of fun playing there?’ No, I don’t. I’d much rather have fun and win a Super Bowl than be miserable and win five Super Bowls.”</p>
      <p>Enter Belichick and his elephant-like memory on Sunday.</p>

      <p>“It looked like everyone had fun out there today and we played with a lot of good energy, and it was good to come down here and get a win,” Belichick told reporters.</p>
      <p>Anyone who doesn’t believe that wasn’t an intentional (albeit subtle) shot doesn’t believe Tom Brady is an elite quarterback. Every strained morsel that comes from Belichick’s mouth is calculated.</p>
      <p>It was amusing — and “fun” — to see Belichick’s well-played tweak, which was a break from the monotony of his usual array of dismissive one-word non-answers.</p>
