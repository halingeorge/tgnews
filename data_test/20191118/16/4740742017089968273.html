      <p>A popular <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/henleaze">Henleaze</a> café avoided more than £45,000 in tax.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/bristol-restaurants-named-tax-avoidance-3268222">HMRC</a> has charged Café 96, in Henleaze Road, £23,539 because of deliberate tax defaults between 2012 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The business avoided payments of £45,789, according to the September update of HMRC’s ‘Deliberate Defaulters’ list.</p>
      <p>Café 96 has garnered a string of glowing reviews on TripAdvisor, with an average of four and a half stars after 43 ratings.</p>
      <p>One review reads: “Great local independent café that is not a chain and is well supported by locals.</p>
      <p>“Called in for the traditional English breakfast and a cup of tea and it was the full works and was well prepared. Incredibly good value for money.”</p>
      <p>Others praised the “perfection” of the food and the “lovely” atmosphere at the “delightful” café.</p>
      <p>HMRC lists the defaulter as Ms Xiu Mei Lu, who is an active director of the business, according to Companies House.</p>
      <p>And the Companies House records show Café 96 was issued a notice for compulsory strike-off in February.</p>

      <p>The company was warned it would be dissolved in two months unless it provided evidence it was still running.</p>
      <p>This notice was temporarily suspended in April because Companies House received an objection to the strike-off.</p>
      <p>Café 96 has been approached for comment.</p>
      <h3>Is the ‘name and shame’ list effective?</h3>
      <p>The Publishing Details of Deliberate Defaulters (PDDD) scheme provides information about people and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/business/">companies</a> given financial penalties for failing to comply with tax obligations or deliberately filing errors in tax returns.</p>
      <p>Details are published when a person or business has made at least one deliberate default on more than £25,000.</p>
      <p>HMRC’s own research last year found the 'name and shame' scheme is largely ineffective as a deterrent – mainly because not many people know it exists.</p>
      <p>The report said: “The research found no strong evidence that PDDD is an effective deterrent to defaulting on one's tax obligations, either for businesses and individuals that submit their own tax returns and therefore have the potential to deliberately default, or for those that have actually defaulted in the recent past.</p>
      <p>“Among the general public, awareness of PDDD was relatively low, with only just over a quarter aware of the policy.</p>
      <p>“None of the named defaulters felt publication had affected them, and some did not even know that their details had been published.”</p>
      <p>The HMRC website warns: “If you wait until HMRC investigates you, and do not provide all the information we need right at the start of the investigation, you run the risk of having your details published.”</p>
