      <p>Ukraine's military confirmed on Monday that <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/kremlin-confirms-putin-to-take-part-in-ukrainian-peace-summit-in-paris-262934">Russia is returning three Ukrainian naval ships </a>that it captured in the Kerch Strait in November 2018.</p>
      <p>Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier on Monday that Moscow had successfully handed three naval ships it captured last year back to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Ukraine has been pushing for their return as a goodwill gesture from Moscow ahead of a four-way peace summit on eastern Ukraine next month in Paris.</p>
      <p>More than 13,000 people have been killed in the more than five-year-old conflict in east Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces.</p>
      <p>Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula, which prompted Western sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising to end the conflict.</p>
