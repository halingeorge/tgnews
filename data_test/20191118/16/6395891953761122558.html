      <p><b>BAR HARBOR, MaineÂ (AP)</b> - A U.S. Coast Guard airplane is in the air as the search for a missing sailboat enters the third day.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard searched 2,700 nautical miles over the weekend after someone called 911 early Saturday to say that a boat was in distress. The Coast Guard determined that the call came from a location 20 miles south of Mount Desert Island.</p>
      <p>The missing sailboat is a 40-footer named the Dove, with three crew members.</p>
      <p>Petty Officer Nicole Groll, a Coast Guard spokeswoman, said the search has covered an area from Maine to Nantucket Island off the Massachusetts coast.</p>
      <p>So far, searchers have found no evidence of the boat. Groll said the Coast Guard is investigating all options about where the boat could've gone.</p>
