      <h1>Video: Any man who services a woman in bed for over 30 minutes is a mad person – Nigerian pastor</h1>

      <p>Ladies of today dully consider the number of minutes a guy lasts in bed before agreeing to marry them in the long run. To these ladies, marrying a guy who can’t last long in bed during intercourse can’t be classified a marriage material and also not worth dying for.</p>
      <p>This perception is relatively weird; however, you can’t blame them either taking into consideration the benefits of intercourse in relationships. But in the rightful thinking of as Pastor Oladele Ogundipe, any man who services a woman in bed for over 30 minutes is a mad person</p>
      <p>Pastor Oladele Ogundipe during his sermon in church asserted that a meaningful s-x between a couple should not be more than five minutes and that any man who wants to stay on a woman for over 30 minutes is a mad man.</p>
      <p>His assertion in the viral video has garnered several reactions. It could be recalled that renowned <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/two-powerful-angels-in-ghana-on-heat-as-rev-obofour-descends-heavily-on-angel-obinim-calls-him-fake-fraudster-among-others/">Ghanaian Cleric Bishop Obinim</a> made a similar assertion concerning duration s-x should last.</p>
      <p>In one of his sermons, he indicated that s-x shouldn’t exceed 15 minutes and that s-x mostly last for 10 minutes.</p>
