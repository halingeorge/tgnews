      <p>An Italian youth soccer coach was fired Saturday after his team defeated an opponent 27-0, including getting seven goals from one player.</p>
      <p>Invictasauro, an under-18 squad, fired Massimiliano Riccini after the blowout Tuesday over Marina Calcio.</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>The firing came after Marina Calcio sporting director Tiberio Pratesi claimed Invictasauro disrespected his club in the win. Marina Calcio suffered several key injuries in the match, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/italian-serie-a/story/3992197/manager-sacked-after-27-0-win-as-club-president-left-fuming-at-a-lack-of-respect">ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>An Invictasauro representative called Pratesi after the match and apologized for the 27-0 win. The club’s president, Paolo Brogelli, later announced the departure of Riccini.</p>
      <p>“We were stunned and deeply regretful when hearing that our [Juniors] team had beaten Marina Calcio 27-0,” Progelli said <a href="https://www.grossetosport.com/16-11-2019/linvictasauro-fa-27-reti-in-una-partita-ed-il-presidente-paolo-brogelli-esonera-il-tecnico-i-nostri-tecnici-hanno-il-compito-di-educare-i-ragazzi/153074/?fbclid=IwAR1vbbVzre72r_WYMDyamxkOEgZo8UUV57DqVf-usKPcbQoTqwNi0wL5UnE">in a statement</a>.</p>

      <p>"The values of youth team football are antithetical to such a thing. The opponent must always be respected and that did not happen today.</p>
      <p>“As president, I sincerely apologize to the Marina club. I announce that our directors decided, unanimously, to sack coach Riccini.</p>
