      <p>"The interest shown in our brands is valuable as it shows that the perception they create in the countries where they open stores is strong, as well as putting forth how effective the steps taken in line with years-long branding are," she added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>20,000 STORES ABROAD BY 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>During interviews with Daily Sabah, executives said they were pleased with the current situation abroad, and pledged even greater expansion in the period ahead. In addition to already proven quality production and products, according to executives, Turkish brands have everything they need to obtain even greater recognition in the international arena.</p>
      <p>BMD's 106 brands currently have stores in around 125 countries, the association's chairman, Sinan Öncel, told Daily Sabah. "BMD member brands have nearly doubled the number of their stores abroad in nearly three years, reaching almost 4,396," he said, adding that this figure goes up to around 17,280 when 12,884 other sales points are included.</p>
      <p>"We aim for BMD member companies to reach 20,000 stores abroad by 2023," he added.</p>
      <p>A global player in the clothing industry, Turkey is the fifth-largest supplier of the world and the third-largest supplier of the European Union, according to İHKİB board member Nejdet Ayaydın, who is also a member of the board of one of the most prestigious women's ready-to-wear brands İpekyol.</p>
      <p>"In 2018, we carried out exports worth $17.6 billion to 224 countries and autonomous regions. Some 75% of our country's total ready-to-wear exports were performed by over 10,000 members of İHKİB," Ayaydın noted.</p>
      <p>According to İHKİB data, ready-to-wear exports by member companies in the first 10 months of this year reached $10.3 billion, while the country's total ready-to-wear exports amounted to $14.8 billion.</p>
      <p>In his address at a dinner his association traditionally organizes every year on the sidelines of the event, Shopping Malls and Investors Association (AYD) Chairman Hüseyin Altaş noted the importance of the world's largest international retail and real estate exhibition, which offers important opportunity for Turkey's projects with high-standards to meet global retailers and shopping mall investors.<br/><br/><b>KİĞILI'S MASSIVE OPENING IN GERMANY</b></p>
      <p>The year 2020 will be a year of major opening into the German market for Kiğılı, a major Turkish brand specialized in menswear, the company's CEO Hilal Suerdem told Daily Sabah.</p>
      <p>"We are developing a different project for Germany. Rather than the retail store concept, we are in a different structuring; a system that will rapidly introduce our brand and that will make us pretty accessible. The logic behind is to be close to customers as much as possible. We want to announce it when everything is set," Suerdem explained.</p>
      <p>The firm has already finalized an investment in the country and has rented a large site that, as a concept, will include a store, storehouse, showroom and office, he stated. "We looked for a strategy that will enable us to reach many regions in the country and we have found such a strategy," he stressed.</p>
      <p>"Briefly, we will be in 32 cities in a period of one year. It is a really big project," Morris Erginbaş, International Sales and Marketing Director at Kiğılı, underscored, adding that first store will be opened in Düsseldorf.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FOOTBALL TEAMS SEEK SPONSORSHIP</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Many football clubs in Germany approached us the moment they heard we are opening to Germany. They asked us to make sponsorship agreements with them," said Erginbaş.</p>
      <p>"We have agreed with Schalke 04 for the 2020 season," Suerdem added. "We have agreed with Dusseldorf for this season."</p>
      <p>Erginbaş continued by saying, "You will see Kiğılı everywhere after two weeks, starting with a match with Bayern Munich." He added that many teams from other sports branches also showed interest.</p>
      <p>The Turkish brand currently operates in 32 countries, according to the executives, who said the brand is continuously adding new stores and has just recently opened a store in Romania, Palestine and Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>In addition to Germany and its other operations abroad, the firm also looks to expand into neighboring countries, including those in the Balkans, Erginbaş emphasized. "We have decided to make our own investments in the Balkans. We will open two stores in two shopping malls, BBI and Alta, in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2020," he said, adding that they also have plans to open a store in the country's southern city of Mostar, a hot spot for tourists. The company has already given a franchise to a firm in the country.</p>
      <p>"We opened companies in North Macedonia and Serbia," he continued, explaining that they also have a dealership in Kosovo, one store in the capital Prishtina and will soon open another one in Prizren. "We have reached 11 stores in the Balkans," he stressed.</p>
