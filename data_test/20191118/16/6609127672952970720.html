      <p>They say the crash was avoidable if they had taken to time to scrape their windscreen.</p>
      <p>The driver has been charged with a number of alleged offences, including dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Police Scotland said: "#WestLothianRP attended a collision this morning which was more than likely avoidable had they taken an extra few minutes to clear their windscreen.</p>

      <p>And Scots are braced for another overnight freeze tonight with the subzero temperatures to return.</p>
      <p>A homeless man died in Glasgow after taking unwell in a Glasgow multi-storey car park in the freezing temperatures.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old was discovered having taken unwell at the NCP car park on Mitchell Street at around 5.50pm yesterday.</p>
      <p>And a Scots hillwalker has been missing overnight on the coldest night of the year after vanishing yesterday.</p>
      <p>Paul Murphy, 51, was last seen leaving his home in Stenhousemuir, Falkirk, at around 7am yesterday, as he set off to go hillwalking.</p>
      <p>He left in his car which has since been found at the Cairngorms Ski Centre in Aviemore.</p>
      <p>He has not been seen or heard from since, and concerns are growing for his safety amid freezing temperatures.</p>
