      <p>A Tiruchi-based NGO helped the Railway Protection Force (RPF) rescue 10 homeless people from the Tiruchi railway junction on Monday. The organisation was approached by the RPF and asked to rehabilitate them after they noticed several people sleeping on the platforms.</p>
      <p>C. R. Raja, Executive Director, Heal India and Kangaroo Karunai Illam, who led the rescue work says that one of the 10 people rescued will be reunited with his family tomorrow. The other nine will be taken care of at the Kangaroo Karunai Illam. “The RPF will continue to rescue and hand over these rescued people to us,” Mr. Raja said, as he requested government support in rehabilitating them.</p>
