      <p>OTTAWA — Conservative Sen. Jean-Guy Dagenais is leaving his party's caucus over concerns about leader Andrew Scheer's socially conservative views.</p>
      <p>Dagenais says he'll remain a member of the party, but he's going to sit with the newly-formed Canadian Senators Group in the upper chamber.</p>
      <p>Dagenais says Scheer's views on abortion and same-sex marriage led to a "mass exodus" of support in the province of Quebec and that he thinks there's no possibility things will change in time for the next election.</p>
      <p>He says given his opinions, it would be inappropriate for him to continue to participate in the Conservative caucus.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Senators Group was formed earlier this month by 11 senators seeking to ensure regional issues get their due.</p>
      <p>The majority of its members have links to the Conservative party, but Sen. Percy Downe, who was appointed as a Liberal, was also announced as a new member of the group today.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 18, 2019.</p>
