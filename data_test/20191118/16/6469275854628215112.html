      <p>Harry Potter, Where’s Wally? and a jolly court jester were amongst the imaginative costumes on parade for a fancy dress fund-raiser for Children in Need.<br/>Staff from Suresite Group, in Fulwood, raised £316.50 for the national charity appeal, by dressing up, selling raffle tickets and enjoying a lunch.</p>
      <p>Raffle prizes included champagne, donated by Hays Recruitment, M&amp;S vouchers from Search, a Majestic classic selection of wine, gifted by branding and digital agency Seven Seven, a set of headphones donated by branded merchandise and print company Pink Sheep and a FitBit3, donated by Suresite Group.</p>
      <p>Suresite Group has raised money every year for Children in Need since 2007.<br/>Janine Wilson, people development manager, Suresite Group, said: “Charity fund-raising has always been really important to Suresite Group. We raise money for a number of projects, both locally and nationally.<br/>“Our fancy dress fund-raiser for Children in Need was a lot of fun and there was a great atmosphere in the office all day. Everyone should be very proud of the money we raised.”</p>
