      <p>'Brazen' burglars forced Sherwood cafe The Bakehouse to close today after stealing the safe containing the weekend's takings.</p>
      <p>The two men weren't bothered about being seen by passersby walking along Mansfield Road, through the large floor to ceiling windows, as they searched inside around 10pm last night.</p>
      <p>The break-in, which took just a minute, was captured on CCTV.</p>
      <p>Business owners Craig and Rosea Poynter closed the cafe today to deal with repairs to the back door where the offenders broke in using a crow bar.</p>

      <p>Rosea, who is expecting their second child, said: "At 30 weeks pregnant it's not what you want. It's really frustrating. It will be covered by the insurance but it can take a while and as a small business cash flow is important.</p>
      <p>"They managed to rip a hole in the back door. It looks like they were career criminals as they had hoods up and were wearing gloves.</p>
      <p>"I don't think they knew the property as they were looking in the toilets. They ripped the safe out with the cash takings from the weekend. We're not sure yet exactly how much but it would have been a few grand. Fortunately a lot of people pay on card.</p>

      <p>"It was brazen doing this at 10pm when people are walking past the big glass fronted windows."</p>
      <p>Mrs Poynter added there had been a spate of house burglaries in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/passenger-numbers-up-nottingham-city-3550592">Sherwood</a> over the last week.</p>
      <p>"It's a blessing they didn't trash the place. It's a good exercise for us in terms of what we need to do to upgrade our security."</p>
      <p>The couple are hoping to re-open The Bakehouse tomorrow (Tuesday, November 19).</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Police are reviewing <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/staff-radford-shop-threatened-knife-3549025">CCTV </a>and conducting enquiries into the incident.</p>

      <p>Sergeant Wealthall, from the local neighbourhood policing team, said: “We have also had two residential burglaries reported to us in the Sherwood area in the last week.</p>
      <p>"We are investigating all of these reports thoroughly and I would encourage residents to take sensible precautions, such as keeping doors and windows locked.”</p>
      <p>Witnesses are asked to call Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 812 of November 2019.</p>
