      <p><b>DOYLESTOWN, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - Authorities in Pennsylvania say they won't pursue the death penalty against a man convicted in the slayings of three young men found buried at a suburban Philadelphia farm.</p>
      <p>The Bucks County district attorney's office said Monday that it is dropping its pursuit with the understanding of the victims' families.</p>
      <p>A sentencing hearing was scheduled Monday for 22-year-old Sean Kratz. He was convicted Friday of first-degree murder and other offenses.</p>
      <p>A cousin, 22-year-old Cosmo DiNardo, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say DiNardo lured the victims to his family's Solebury farm in 2017 as part of a robbery plot. They say Kratz shot one man in the head and served as a lookout while DiNardo killed the others.</p>
      <p>DiNardo also confessed to killing a fourth man.</p>
