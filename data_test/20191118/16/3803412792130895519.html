      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Yes, and no. There's no built-in SmartCast app, and the built-in Chromecast feature doesn't work at all. Apple's AirPlay feature does, however.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A galaxy of videos: <a href="https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU58951YYw%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpreview.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=DwREBB4-">Disney+</a> ($7/month at Disney+)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Here's what's going on</h4>
      <p>There's no Disney+ app in the built-in SmartCast operating system. That's a shame — especially for those who <i>only</i> use the built-in OS with their Vizio TV without any other sort of streaming device plugged in. And that <i>shouldn't</i> be (and in fact isn't quite) the end of the world because all modern Vizio TVs also serve as a target for Chromecast — Google's (and Android's) method of getting video from a phone to a TV — and Apple's AirPlay protocol.</p>
      <p>AirPlay works just fine. If you have Disney+ on an iPhone or iPad, you can use it to to get Disney+ onto your Vizio TV without anything else plugged into it.</p>
      <p>Chromecast, however, <a href="https://support.vizio.com/s/article/Disney-App-EXT?language=en_US">does not work</a>. Try, and you'll be greeted with an error message.</p>
      <p>All's not lost, though. You can plug in virtually <i>any</i> modern streaming dongle, box or stick and get access to Disney+ — and a lot more than you'll get natively with SmartCast, now that we think about it — that way. Grab a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-Media-Player/dp/B07WVFCVJN/?tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58951YYw">$29 Roku Express</a>. Or use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA3A00403A14-Chromecast-Ultra/dp/B0157OY5EA?tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58951YYw">$69 Chromecast Ultra</a>. Or how about a $49 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21?tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58951YYw">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</a>? It really just depends on what you want to use — they'll all get you there.</p>
      <p>And, by the way, Vizio says it's expecting a native SmartCast app from Disney+ in 2020.</p>
      <h4>Disney+ — the short version</h4>
