      <p>Deputies said the 28-year-old victim, who lives in Lowell, was severely injured. He was taken to Spectrum Health Hospitals Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, where he was listed Saturday in serious but stable condition.</p>
      <p>The brothers told deputies they had gotten separated while searching for a deer in dense corn around 5:30 p.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>"The shooter in this case was some distance away and believed he saw the deer moving and heard the deer making noise," deputies said in a news release. The victim's 29-year-old brother, who lives in Saranac, opened fire and struck the 28-year-old with a shot from his muzzle-loading rifle, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>Deputies said the 29-year-old called 911 for help immediately after he shot his brother. Deputies were investigating the case to determine the exact cause of the shooting. Officials said Saturday that all people involved in the incident were fully cooperating with investigators.</p>
