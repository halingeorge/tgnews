      <p>Yang has called out the company for deleting a series of explicit copycat comments on its official Instagram account referencing the sketch that aired Saturday on NBC.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/03/saturday-night-live-mocks-elizabeth-warren-52-trillion-medicare-for-all/"><i>SNL</i></a> sketch, Styles plays a social media moderator for Sara Lee who is caught using the official company Instagram account to post emoji-illustrated sexual fantasies and to make graphic comments about threesomes and other sexual acts.</p>
      <p>Some of his comments included “Destroy me King and “Wreck me Daddy,” both of which were directed at Nick Jonas. Another comment featured abundant use of the eggplant emoji.</p>

      <p>Following Saturday’s broadcast, the real Sara Lee reportedly experienced a flood of copycat comments on its Instagram account @SaraLeeBread, prompting the hashtag #SaraLee to start trending on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Yang, who stars in the sketch as a Sara Lee executive, has accused the real Sara Lee of censoring some those comments.</p>
      <p>“Sara Lee disabling and deleting IG comments wow they really could have been THE bread for f*gs,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>When reached for comment, Sara Lee’s parent company <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/sara-lee-reacts-to-harry-styles-raunchy-snl-sketch/">told</a> the <i>New York Post</i>: “We didn’t participate in creating the skit and its content doesn’t align with Sara Lee Bread’s brand. But, we all know SNL pushes the envelope for laughs and we are taking it in stride.”</p>
