      <p>Following <a href="https://www.cbr.com/rumor-deadpool-3-development/">reports of <i>Deadpool 3</i></a> being in development at Marvel Studios, one of the cast members from the first two films, T.J. Miller, has opened up about his disinterest in making a return to the franchise.</p>
      <p>"Of course, if they want me to do <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/deadpool-3/">Deadpool 3</a></i>, I’m going to. I’m under contract," Miller said on <i><a href="https://adamcarolla.com/tj-miller-and-mark-geragos/?fbclid=IwAR0bzC70EwX7vAzvqx32_DAAihU19FFnZWgB3yzEHSqA7l56yGDs_5ZGSDQ">The Adam Corolla Show</a></i>. "To be honest, I’d almost would rather that they didn’t. I think <i>Deadpool 2</i>, we knocked it out of the park. I really think it ended up being great and I was worried about that. So what if <a href="https://screenrant.com/deadpool-3-kill-x-men-universe/amp/"><i>Deadpool 3</i></a> is… eh."</p>

      <p>Since Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox, Marvel Studios has yet to unveil how, exactly, it plans to weave the character's R-rated nature <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-deadpool-mcu-r-rated/">into the Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. However, with Ryan Reynolds having recently paid a visit to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-marvel-studios-photo-mcu-speculation/">Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios</a>, the wait for an official <i>Deadpool 3</i> announcement may soon be over.</p>
      <p>Miller made his debut in the R-rated superhero franchise as Wade Wilson's best friend Weasel in 2016's <i>Deadpool</i>. He then reprised the role in David Leitch's <i>Deadpool 2</i>, which also stars Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Stefan Kapičić as Colossus, Zazie Beetz as Domino, Julian Dennison as Russell and Josh Brolin as Cable.</p>
