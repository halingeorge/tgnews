      <p>If you’ve experienced the mild horror of losing, or even momentarily thinking you may have lost, an AirPod, then beware these fake AirPod stickers. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/PabloRochat/status/1196117139070963713">genius prank</a>, Pablo Rochat made these incredibly realistic stickers of AirPods and placed them on sidewalks. They’re even the right size. When stuck to the ground, they look just like actual AirPods — so much so that you might check your pocket (or your ears) to make sure you didn’t drop yours by accident.</p>

      <p>Now, you can pull this prank, too. Rochat has templates of the stickers for both the original AirPods and AirPods Pro available for <a href="http://pablorochat.com/freebies">free downloads on his website</a>. Rogue fake AirPods could soon take over your streets.</p>
