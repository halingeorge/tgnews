      <p>Tobias Menzies has revealed that he was third-in-line for the role of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-philip/">Prince Philip</a> in the new series of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-crown/">The Crown</a> and we’re honestly shocked.</p>
      <p>Taking over the role of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth</a>’s husband from Matt Smith and starring opposite Oscar winner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/olivia-colman/">Olivia Colman</a> in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/crown-season-3-review-olivia-colman-reigns-supreme-queen-elizabeth-steps-back-major-plot-roles-11039940/">Netflix drama’s third series</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/outlander/">Outlander</a> star Tobias was left with some pretty big shoes to fill as he joined the franchise.</p>
      <p>This was made all the more challenging as the actor revealed that he was aware he wasn’t their first choice at the time of filming, with Netflix bosses originally having their eye on both Kingsman’s Mark Strong and Marvel’s Paul Bettany for the role.</p>
      <p>‘Initially I think they went after Mark Strong, then Paul Bettany, and then it came back around to me,’ Tobias told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tobias-menzies-interview-the-crown-season-three-prince-phillip-n8n2kqcpd">The Sunday Times Magazine</a>.</p>

      <p>We know, it’s hard to believe, but even world-class actors get picked last – the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/james-mcavoy-third-line-dark-materials-role-11041045/">same thing happened to James McAvoy</a> in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/his-dark-materials/">His Dark Materials</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Tobias was unfazed by this progression and, if anything, was surprised by just how easy the casting process was.</p>

      <p>‘I did one audition where I read 10 pages with Colly [Olivia Colman] and two weeks later I found out. Weirdly, for the size of the show it was relatively straightforward.’</p>
      <p>It turns out auditioning for the role was the least of Tobias’ problems, with the pressures of playing such a well known public figure bringing its own challenge for the Game of Thrones actor.</p>
      <p>‘I read quite a bit and a lot of it began technically. The voice is very important — and the gestures… He’s very pointy,’ the 45-year-old said.</p>
      <p>‘Wanting to be like him but not have it become a caricature is quite a tough pitch. If you become too vocally mannered, then it’s hard for the viewer to get into the story.’</p>
      <p>Launching on Sunday, the new series of The Crown has been praised by critics and fans alike, with the show’s portrayal of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/crown-season-3-praised-heartbreaking-aberfan-disaster-portrayal-11171015/">1966 Aberfan disaster</a> gaining particular admiration for its heartfelt and unflinching tribute to the 144 people who died in the Welsh mining town.</p>
