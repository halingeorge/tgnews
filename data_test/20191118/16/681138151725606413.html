        <b>Police are warning drivers in a Suffolk seaside town to show consideration for their neighbours after receiving reports of anti-social behaviour in one of the car parks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Halesworth Police, who serve the communities of East Suffolk, said the Fort Green car park in Slaughden Road, Aldeburgh, has become a hotspot for car enthusiasts.</p>
      <p>They have warned drivers to reduce the amount of noise their cars produce following complaints from residents in the last week.</p>
      <p>Halesworth Police said: "Fort Green car park in Aldeburgh has become a popular meeting point for car enthusiasts.</p>
      <p>"We're aware some are using their cars in an anti-social way with no consideration for those living close by.</p>
      <p>"Please remember your actions impact on others.</p>
      <p>"It's a common misconception that car-parks are an area in which traffic offences cannot be prosecuted. This is untrue, and Section 59 notices can be issued for the anti-social behaviour use of a motor vehicle in a car park as they can on a public road.</p>
      <p>"If you are one of those gathering in Fort Green car park or know somebody who is, please have some thought for those residents living close by who are affected negatively by the noise and disturbance.</p>
      <p>"Police do not wish to stop such gatherings, provided they are respectful and legal.</p>
      <p>"We would encourage the public to report any incidents of anti-social driving and behaviour so that we can ensure reports are dealt with swiftly.</p>
      <p>"The public can assist police by recording the vehicle registration details of the vehicles involved, along with a description of the vehicles and its occupants.</p>
      <p>"In addition, anybody with relevant dash-cam footage should contact Halesworth Safer Neighbourhood Team or by calling 101."</p>
      <p>Businesses in Aldeburgh have reported hearing loud noises from the car park "once or twice a week" in recent times.</p>
