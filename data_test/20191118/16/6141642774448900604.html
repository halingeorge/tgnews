      <p>Two men and a woman have been shot dead outside a Walmart store in south-western Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Two victims were shot inside a car and the third was in the car park outside the store in Duncan, Police Chief Danny Ford said.</p>
      <p>The gunman was among the dead, police said.</p>
      <p>Two bodies covered with sheets were visible in the car park on Monday afternoon. One body was in the driver’s seat of a red, two-door car. The other body was lying on the ground next to the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Bullet holes were visible in the car’s windshield. Police said in a Facebook post that a handgun was found at the scene.</p>
      <p>Authorities from multiple agencies including the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, the state highway patrol and the Stephens County sheriff’s office were investigating the scene.</p>

      <p>Aaron Helton, of Duncan, said he was parking outside the Walmart where he planned to buy groceries when he heard about nine gunshots.</p>
      <p>“I arrived and there were three bodies,” Mr Helton said.</p>
      <p>No staff members were involved in the shooting and the store was not evacuated, Walmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins said.</p>
      <p>“This was an isolated incident in the parking lot and was not an active shooter situation,” Jenkins said.</p>
      <p>Duncan is about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>The Walmart store is in a commercial centre that includes a sporting goods store and a dollar store along US Highway 81, the main road that passes through Duncan heading south toward Texas.</p>
