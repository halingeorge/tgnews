      <h1>'We have been looking' - latest on new investment plans for Derby County</h1>

      <p>Mel Morris says the challenge to succeed at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county?hjhhjhhjhjh">Derby County</a> remains a "constant quest".</p>
      <p>Derby's owner and chairman, who bought the Rams in 2015, has invested tens of millions of pounds in the club and he has been searching for new investment.</p>
      <p>That investment could be in place by the end of the year, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/">DerbyshireLive</a> understands.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mel-morris-rich-list-efl-3423255">Morris</a> said recently that the club is "close" to landing new investment.</p>
      <p>Those discussions are ongoing, and progressing.</p>
      <p>Morris recently received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2019 Derby Telegraph Sports Awards' ceremony at which he said: "We have been looking for investment and we are close to trying to get something sorted out on that front, which is important," he added.</p>
      <p>"I have always believed that it's not the best structure to have a single person at the club because it's expensive, but also because you need a balance. So we have been looking for the right person."</p>
      <p>As DerbyshireLive has reported previously, it is likely to be part-investment and not a takeover.</p>

      <p>Mel Morris' words at the Sports Awards' evening pointed to the new investment being a 'partnership', with him staying on which is something he has said he is very keen to do.</p>
      <p>Morris was asked on the night if owning Derby County has been what he expected.</p>

      <p>"It's not been anything like I thought it would be like, it has been a lot tougher than I thought it would be," he said.</p>
      <p>"But it's one of the challenges. What keeps us going is the fans, the supporters of the club.</p>
      <p>"We want to achieve. We want to continue to strive for more. That is a constant quest for us.</p>
      <p>"So, of course, that needs money but it also needs the people - and we have got some great people."</p>
      <p>Derby have gone close to winning promotion in four of the past six seasons.</p>
      <p>They were beaten finalists in 2014 and again in May of this year when they lost to Aston Villa at Wembley.</p>
