      <h1>Callum Smith's trainer taunts Billy Joe Saunders with Anfield declaration</h1>
      <h2>Eddie Hearn is talking to Liverpool FC about Smith fighting at the stadium in 2020, and trainer Joe Gallagher says he needs a big box office opponent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:43:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/billy-joe-saunders">Billy Joe Saunders</a> is not a big enough name to fight <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/callum-smith">Callum Smith</a> at Anfield, claims his trainer Joe Gallagher.</p>
      <p>Promoter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/eddie-hearn">Eddie Hearn</a> is talking to Liverpool about Smith fighting at Anfield early next summer if he comes through the second defence of his WBA Super super-middleweight title on Saturday against John Ryder.</p>
      <p>Gallagher claims Smith needs a high-profile opponent to help him fill Anfield and claims WBO champ Saunders is not big enough box office, despite being a two-weight world champ.</p>
      <p>“It’s an opportunity and we will see what happens,” said Gallagher. “But we don’t want Anfield with just 10,000 there, we want Anfield with a proper dance partner.</p>

      <p>“From what I hear about Billy Joe Saunders he either wants to move back down to middleweight or get the Canelo fight.</p>
      <p>“But I don’t think Billy Joe Saunders would bring 30-40,000 in, just look at his last fights.</p>
      <p>“We will just have to wait and see, but first and foremost, we have to take care of John Ryder and he’s in the form of his life.”</p>

      <p>Gallagher is confident Smith will beat Islington’s Ryder at the M&amp;S Bank Arena to extend his unbeaten record to 27-0 in his first fight in his native Liverpool since September 2017.</p>
      <p>He says he has performed better than ever in training and claims the youngest of the four fighting brothers is still improving at 29.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t see the best of Callum Smith yet, that’s the frightening thing,” said Gallagher.</p>
      <p>“Against George Groves I was really annoyed that he stopped him in the seventh round because he had so much more to show in terms of shot selection.</p>
      <p>“Listen, he’s still got huge potential and hopefully John Ryder will be able to bring another skill set out of Callum for everyone to sit back and say he is the real deal.</p>
      <p>“We did testing last week and everything is the best it’s been. His weight is down, that tells you everything that he won’t take any challenge lightly. He’s absolutely on it.</p>
      <p>“It’s the homecoming and he won’t anything spoil that.”</p>
