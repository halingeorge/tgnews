      </p>
      <h3>Leaderboard</h3>
      <p>-20 Todd</p>
      <p>-19 Taylor, Long, Ortiz</p>
      <p>-17 English</p>
      <h3>Day four report</h3>
      <p>Brendon Todd held his nerve to claim the third PGA Tour title of his career after a rain-hit Mayakoba Golf Classic carried over into a fifth day in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Thursday's play was washed out due to persistent rain, with the second round staged on Saturday before rounds three and four were played in three-balls at the first and 10th tee for as long as the light permitted.</p>
      <p>This left Todd and fellow American Vaughn Taylor as joint leaders at 20 under par with four holes of the tournament remaining on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Todd, who won the Bermuda Championship earlier this month, took the initiative at the 15th hole - his first on Monday - with a birdie to get to 21 under.</p>
      <p>A bogey at the next saw him drop back alongside Taylor, but Todd was at the summit on his own again with two holes remaining after his playing partner bogeyed the 16th.</p>
      <p>And the 34-year-old parred the last two holes to hold onto his one-shot advantage ahead of home favourite Carlos Ortiz and American Adam Long, who both posted final rounds of 66, and Taylor on 19 under.</p>
      <h3>Day three report</h3>
      <p>Brendon Todd and Vaughn Taylor are tied for the lead with three-and-a-half holes to go in the Mayakoba Classic, which will resume on Monday after failing light forced play to be suspended.</p>
      <p>Todd bogeyed the 14th hole of the final round just before the horn blew for the end of play, and after Taylor saved par the pair were inseparable at the top of the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>Mexico's Carlos Ortiz is just one shot back, but he has just one hole left to play and likely needs to birdie the tough 18th to hold any chance.</p>
      <p>Harris English sits alongside him on 19-under after two late birdies got him back into contention, and he'll return to a 15-foot birdie putt when play resumes on Monday lunchtime UK time.</p>
      <p>Todd also has a birdie chance of around 25 feet, with Taylor inside five feet for par, as the final group finish the par-three 15th before heading to a tricky closing stretch which at least gives Ortiz hope.</p>
      <h3>Day two report</h3>
      <p>American Harris English will be hoping to turn back the clock when he takes a one-shot lead into Sunday at the rain-marred Mayakoba Golf Classic in Mexico on Sunday.</p>
      <p>English fired a superb second round of seven-under 64 on Saturday to follow a first round 65 carded on Friday, a day after Thursday's washout, leaving him at 13 under par through two rounds.</p>
      <p>Players will be grouped in threes for the third round and regrouped after it is completed. Organisers are hoping to finish the tournament on Sunday, but if necessary play will resume early on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old English won this tournament in 2014 - and hasn't won since.</p>
      <p>He heads into Sunday leading by the barest margin from countryman Vaughn Taylor, who had a 66 on Saturday to lie one stroke ahead of another American, Brendon Todd, who shot 68.</p>
      <p>New Zealand's Danny Lee sits next on 10-under following a Saturday 70.</p>
      <p>English said he was looking to parlay his early-season momentum into his third career win on the PGA Tour.</p>
      <p>"I think I missed two greens today," he said after chipping in for birdie on the 18th. "And if you do that every day out here, you're going to take it deep."</p>
      <p>Scotland's Calum Hill is six shots off the lead in equal 12th place, with England's Graeme MCDowell a further two strokes back.</p>
      <h3>Day one report</h3>
      <p>New Zealand's Danny Lee leads the Mayakoba Classic by one stroke after firing a nine-under par 62 in the opening round.</p>
      <p>South Korean-born Lee was out in 29 at the El Camaleon course in Mexico's Playa del Carmen, helped by an eagle on the fifth, and was 10-under after 13.</p>
      <p>At that stage Lee had thoughts of shooting a sub-60 round, only to three putt from 15 feet on the 14th for his only bogey, before finishing with four pars.</p>
      <p>"Definitely, it was in my head, 59 or 58," said Lee on pgatour.com. "I have never shot that score out on the PGA Tour before, so I really wanted to make that happen.</p>

      <p>"On 14, I had a less than 15-footer for birdie. Just one of those days I felt like I can make anything. I just gave it a little too much extra and hit it through the break and missed the next one coming back. I was a little bit bummed out on that one. But still, nine under is a great start."</p>
      <p>American duo Adam Long and Brendon Todd are tied for second on eight under.</p>
      <p>Todd, who won the Bermuda Championship two weeks ago, missed a five-foot birdie putt at the 18th that would have tied him for the lead.</p>
      <p>Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell and England's Luke Donald led the European challenge on five under.</p>
