      <p>Syfy announced during the third season last year that they were pulling the plug on the TV series <b>“The Expanse</b>,<b>“</b> but it didn’t take long for Amazon to swoop in for the save. On <b>December 13th</b>, the fourth season of the revived series will begin streaming on <b>Amazon Prime</b>, and today the official trailer for the brand new season has been unleashed upon us.</p>
      <p>Season 4 begins a new chapter for the series with the crew of the Rocinante on a mission from the U.N. to explore new worlds beyond the Ring Gate. Humanity has been given access to thousands of Earth-like planets which has created a land rush and furthered tensions between the opposing nations of Earth, Mars and the Belt. Ilus, the first of these planets, is rich with natural resources but also marked by the ruins of a long dead alien civilization.</p>
      <blockquote>While Earthers, Martians and Belters maneuver to colonize Ilus and its natural resources, these early explorers don’t understand this new world and are unaware of the larger dangers that await them.</blockquote>
      <p>Check out the trailer below, along with a recap (hosted by Kevin Smith!) of seasons 1-3.</p>
