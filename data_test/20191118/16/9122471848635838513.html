      <h1>Rutgers Cheerleader Addresses Saturday’s Funny Mistake vs. Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:09:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State did so much scoring against Rutgers on Saturday, even the Scarlet Knights cheerleaders were celebrating. It wasn’t on purpose, though.</p>
      <p>A Rutgers cheerleader mistakenly did some clapping following a J.K. Dobbins touchdown during Saturday’s blowout.</p>
      <p>The cheerleader was seen clapping following the touchdown, before realizing the mistake.</p>
      <p>Pretty funny:</p>

      <p>Oops.</p>
      <p>The Rutgers cheerleader took to Twitter to explain what happened:</p>
      <p>“Hi yea that was me. They were both red so I was a little confused until I saw the rutgers student section not cheering. Oops,” he wrote.</p>

      <p>Hey, it’s tough to blame him. I’d cheer for Ohio State over Rutgers this season, too.</p>
