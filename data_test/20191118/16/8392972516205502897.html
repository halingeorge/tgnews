      <p>Presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> unveiled his new tattoos on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> last night and lots of his fans were left wondering what they meant.</p>
      <p>Ant made his <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/im-a-celebrity-fans-teary-as-ant-mcpartlin-makes-his-return/">return to presenting I'm A Celebrity...</a> on Sunday (November 17) and fans were stunned to see one huge change about him - the new inkings on his arms.</p>

      </p>
      <p>We're used to seeing Ant with his arms covered in smart suits and jackets.</p>
      <p>But the warmer climate in Australia saw him wearing just a short-sleeved shirt, which unveiled new body art on both of his forearms.</p>
      <aside>Ant has a mental health awareness tattoo on his arm.</aside>
      <p>Fans were surprised to see the new markings and, by the looks of them, he's had them done fairly recently.</p>

      <p>And, it's perhaps unsurprising to learn that the TV presenter's new tatts have a particular significance, bearing in mind what a difficult few years he's had - including the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/ant-mcpartlin-to-come-face-to-face-with-lisa-armstrong-to-get-their-divorce-over-and-done-with/">break-up of his marriage</a>, a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin-admits-hes-still-haunted-by-drink-drive-crash/">drink-drive conviction</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin-hails-rock-anne-marie-corbett-for-role-in-recovery/">overcoming an addiction to painkillers</a>.</p>
      <p>According to one tattoo fan, the arrow on his right forearm, and the floral design on the left are all nods to his recent troubles.</p>
      <p>One said: "That tattoo on Ant's arm says 'clean 1 year' #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Ant on I'm A Celeb has a mental health awareness tattoo on his arm."</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10367973/ant-mcpartlin-tattoos-explained-rose-arrow-im-a-celebrity/">The Sun</a>, a single arrow "stands for power and direction" and can also signal moving forward, as "arrows point the way".</p>
      <p>With regard to the rose flower design on his left forearm, that can "express promise, hope and new beginnings.</p>
      <p>"It is contrasted by thorns symbolising defence, loss and thoughtlessness."</p>
      <p>Last year, Ant revealed he'd had the Alcoholics Anonymous symbol tattooed on the inside of his wrist.</p>
      <p>His triangle tattoo inside a circle represents the group's motto "stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety".</p>
      <p>The star also has an 'S' for sober on his right wrist.</p>

      <p>The series kicked off tonight with half of the celebs arriving on board a luxury yacht, while the other half were taken by speedboat to a beach.</p>
      <p>The teams were stunned when the gang on the yacht - Nadine Coyle, Ian Wright, James Haskell, Kate Garraway, and Myles Stephenson - were told they had to swim to the beach in the clothes they were wearing to partner up with someone else.</p>
      <p>Those waiting on the beach were Caitlyn Jenner, Roman Kemp, Adele Roberts, Jacqueline Jossa, and Andrew Maxwell.</p>
      <p>Once the pairs had been made, a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/martin-and-shirlie-kemp-left-breathless-and-shaking-watching-son-roman-on-im-a-celeb/">terrifying challenge awaited six of them</a> as they had to walk the plank high in the sky.</p>

      <p>Ant took a year off after being arrested for drink driving and going to rehab, so he missed presenting last year's series.</p>
      <p>Holly Willoughby made the trip to Australia alongside Dec Donnelly to present in Ant's absence.</p>
      <p>But depsite the fact she was hit with fans, it was made very clear it was just temporary and Ant would be returning.</p>
      <p>And return he has.</p>

      <p>Within minutes of the opening title sequence, Ant and Dec were cracking jokes like they'd never been separated - and fans loved it!</p>
      <p>Some <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/im-a-celebrity-fans-teary-as-ant-mcpartlin-makes-his-return/">were even in tears that he was back</a> and looking so well.</p>
