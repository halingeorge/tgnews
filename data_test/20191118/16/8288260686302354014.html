      <p>Former West Brom head coach Tony Pulis reportedly turned down the chance to return to management with Cardiff City - because the Welshman is holding out for a job in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Pulis left Albion in November 2017 after a run of three wins in 24 league matches spanning two separate campaigns, and has since had an 18-month stint in charge of Middlesbrough which involved two failed attempts at winning promotion from the Championship.</p>

      <p>Linked with the Cardiff vacancy recently, after the departure of fellow managerial stalwart Neil Warnock, the Sun claims that Pulis rejected the chance at jumping back into Championship life with the Bluebirds, because he fancies his chances at landing a top flight gig in the near future.</p>
      <p>Former Millwall manager Neil Harris was eventually appointed as Warnock’s successor and was unveiled to the press on Monday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl and West Ham United gaffer Manuel Pellegrini are said to be under serious pressure at their respective clubs after poor runs of form, and should either job become available any time soon then Pulis is expected to throw his hat into the ring.</p>
      <p>Pulis, who has also had stints at Crystal Palace and Plymouth Argyle among other clubs in a lengthy managerial career, was also recently linked with the job at struggling former side Stoke City before the Potters turned to Northern Ireland head coach Michael O’Neill.</p>
