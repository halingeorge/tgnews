      <p>Amazon released has the first full-length trailer for Season 4 of “The Expanse,” which makes its Amazon debut next month.</p>
      <p>The science fiction series will launch globally Dec. 13 on Amazon Prime. It aired its first three seasons on Syfy. Watch the video above.</p>
      <p>It’s been more than a year since “The Expanse” aired a new episode — it’s third season ended in June 2018 — and Amazon is giving the series a global audience. With that in mind, Amazon released a video of Kevin Smith recapping the first three seasons, which you can view below.</p>

      <p>The series, created by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, follows a police detective in the asteroid belt. He is the first officer of an interplanetary ice freighter and an earth-bound United Nations executive slowly discover a vast conspiracy that threatens the Earth’s rebellious colony on the asteroid belt.</p>
      <p>Per Amazon, Season 4 of “The Expanse” begins a new chapter for the series with the crew of the Rocinante on a mission from the U.N. to explore new worlds beyond the Ring Gate. Humanity has been given access to thousands of Earth-like planets which has created a land rush and furthered tensions between the opposing nations of Earth, Mars and the Belt. Ilus, the first of these planets, is rich with natural resources but also marked by the ruins of a long dead alien civilization.</p>
      <p>While Earthers, Martians and Belters maneuver to colonize Ilus and its natural resources, these early explorers don’t understand this new world and are unaware of the larger dangers that await them.</p>
