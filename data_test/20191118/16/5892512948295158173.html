      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) doesn’t have an event this weekend so regrettably, I am forced to compensate for that lack of pre-event coverage with awful video posts like the one above, which may look familiar to longtime fans of mixed martial arts (MMA).</p>
      <p>Hussain Ayyad broke his leg in the first round, courtesy of a defensive check from Matiss Zaharovs, in the Brave FC 29 event last Friday inside Khalifa Sports City Arena in Bahrain, a grisly scene not unlike the Anderson Silva vs. Chris Weidman finish from late 2013.</p>
      <p>Revisit that disturbing gallery by clicking <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2013/12/29/5252778/ufc-168-in-pictures-anderson-silva-suffers-broken-leg-in-dramatic-scene">here</a>, if you’re into that sort of thing.</p>
      <p>Anyone who remembers what happened to Corey Hill at the promotion’s “Fight for the Troops” event more than a decade ago (<a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2008/12/11/corey-hill-suffers-broken-leg-in-loss-to-dale-hartt-at-ufc-fight-night-16-pic/">see it</a>) will know “The Spider” wasn’t the first televised leg break. We also had <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2014/4/13/5609232/side-by-side-pic-tyrone-spong-anderson-silva-broken-legs-glory-15-ufc-168-istanbul-mma">the Tyrone Spong disaster</a> under the GLORY banner in early 2014.</p>
      <p>Kinda makes you wonder how <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/1/12/16883254/video-crazy-amazon-lady-chops-down-tree-with-her-leg-screams-in-your-face-mma">something like this</a> is even possible.</p>
