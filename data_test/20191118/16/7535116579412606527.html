      <p>According to <a href="http://bernama.com/bm/news.php?id=1789254">Bernama</a>, he said that this program is known as Insentif Generasi Muda Selangor (iGems), and couples would have to attend a family course before they are eligible for the incentive. <b>One person is entitled to RM300 each so if both are from Selangor and attends the course, so together they can receive RM600.Â </b></p>
      <p>This program is different from the previous incentive given by the government, and they have decided to start a new one in order to try and reduce the divorce rate in Selangor. Selangor has one of the highest divorce rates in the country, with a third of marriages less than five years old ending in divorce. In 2017 alone, there were 12,203 couples who got divorced in Selangor.</p>

      <p><b>This program is available for those who are married after 1st September 2018 and applications start from today, November 18th.</b> The course is supposed to inform and guide couples who are going to tie the knot on various aspects such as financial management, emotional management and parenting skills so that they are more prepared for the future.</p>
      <p>This course is only about half a day and couples must attend it to be eligible for the RM300 incentive. The RM300 will be given in the form of a voucher which can be redeemed from any Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN) branch within 45 days.</p>
