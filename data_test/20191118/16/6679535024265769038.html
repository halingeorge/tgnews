      <p>The Income Tax department conducted searches on the premises of Shobikaa Impex, a mosquito net manufacturing unit, for the fourth day on Monday.</p>
      <p>Based on intelligence that the company was indulging in substantial tax evasion, the search was carried out covering about 20 premises, including residences, factory premises and offices of the company.</p>
      <p>Without naming the company, a press release issued on Sunday by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, Ministry of Finance, said the search at a tier III city in Tamil Nadu had led to the seizure of unaccounted cash of ₹32.6 crore and also about 10 kgs of gold jewellery. The undisclosed income of the company and its promoters was estimated at about ₹435 crore, the release said.</p>
      <p>The major finding of the action was that the company had systematically inflated its expenditure using bogus or fabricated invoices. By booking such non-existent expenditure in its books of account, the company and its promoters had suppressed the true income of the company over the years, the release said.</p>
      <p>The company paid for such bogus expenses by cheque or RTGS and then received the cash back. The unaccounted income so generated had been deployed by the company’s promoters into investments in immovable properties by making unaccounted payments, further investments in the business itself as share capital and in fixed deposits, cash and other valuables, the release said.</p>
