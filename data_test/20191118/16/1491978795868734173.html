      <p><b>Name:</b> Face tattoos.</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> They were outlawed by the Roman emperor Constantine in AD316, so older than that.</p>
      <p><b>Appearance:</b> extremely noticeable.</p>
      <p><b>Obviously. You wouldn’t get a tattoo on your face if you didn’t want people noticing it. </b>No. Or if you ever desired gainful employment.</p>
      <p><b>Why is that?</b> They are known in the tattoo trade as “jobstoppers”. A 2018 survey found that six in 10 employers would be “substantially” less likely to hire someone with a face tattoo.</p>
      <p><b>That was then. This is now. </b>In the meantime, face tattoos have become more popular, thanks to Instagram and inked celebrities including Justin Bieber and Little Mix’s Jesy Nelson. “I can’t go a week without a young person coming into our studio asking for a tattoo on their neck, face, or hands,” says Lee Clements of the British Tattoo Artist Federation (BTAF).</p>
      <p><b>That’s because face tattoos are cool. </b>You know they don’t come off, right?</p>
      <p><b>Of course. So what? </b>So what happens when you grow up and apply for a job in public relations?</p>
      <p><b>It will never happen. Anyway, by then having flames tattooed above each eyebrow will probably be completely socially acceptable. </b>But what if it isn’t?</p>
      <p><b>Dunno. </b>This is precisely why the BTAF is proposing to change the legal age for face tattoos.</p>
      <p><b>What is it now? </b>If you are 18, you can legally get a tattoo anywhere on your body. They want to raise it to 21 for anything on the face, neck or hands.</p>
      <p><b>That’s so unfair. Having tats is my right!</b> But why on earth would anyone want tattoos on their face?</p>
      <p><b>Because Lil Xan has them! </b>If Lil Xan robbed a bank, would you do that, too?</p>
      <p><b>I think so. </b>That’s why we need the law changed.</p>
      <p><b>I don’t care about your laws, mate, or what the average Daily Mail reader thinks. </b>They think people with face tattoos should be denied benefit payments.</p>
      <p><b>Really? </b>“If you intentionally make yourself unemployable by doing this – no benefits for you,” said one, commenting on the news.</p>
      <p><b>Well. That is slightly concerning. </b>“Anyone that gets a tattoo on their face which does prevent them from working should have all benefits permanently stopped,” said another.</p>
      <p><b>I don’t see that sentiment gaining wider currency, do you?</b> “Ink on faces should be instant disqualification from access to benefits,” said a third.</p>
      <p><b>Huh. I’m just going to text my mum.</b> OK.</p>
      <p><b>Do say: </b>“It says ‘LIB DEMS’, but I was only getting tattooed tactically.”</p>
      <p><b>Don’t say: </b>“That’s my CV, right there on my left cheek. Ignore the MySpace address.”</p>
