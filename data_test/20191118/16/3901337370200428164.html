        <i>“All I can do is laugh listening to this person and the things he says. He's entitled to his opinion that’s for sure. I for one am not saying Chiefs will win the league, but I’m optimistic that they can. Therefore, in my view he is just another naysayer who can’t stomach the fact that Chiefs are sitting on the totem pole.”</i>

      <p>This was the view of SL Supporter @PeaceLoving in response to Orlando Pirates legend, Edward ‘Magents’ Motale, who in a recent SLTV interview, boldly predicted that the men from Naturena will not win the league this season, despite their impressive start.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, SL Supporter @Honestkhosi feels that Ernst Middendorp’s side is well on course to win their first Absa Premiership title since the 2014/15 season, although they are not getting carried away.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We don't have to be disrupted by anti-Chiefs people like this 'Magents' guy. Chiefs are on course, and it's gonna take a lot for any team to stop 'THE NATURENA TRAIN'. However, we as Kaizer Chiefs, we know very well, that the league title can be not won in November. We honestly have to wait until May 2020 before we can officially lift our league title. As for now, we are working very hard in our training sessions.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Although @SL Supporter MDANANA agrees with the 53-year-old, and feels that it is still a long way to go before the league champions are revealed.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“He is right, because nobody knows who will win the league, but Chiefs fans will be silly if they think beating Sundowns will win them the league.”</i>

        <b>Do you think Kaizer Chiefs can prove the doubters wrong and win the league this season?</b>
