      <h1>Yung Booke Is About His Business in New Freestyle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T16:51:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/robbyseabrookiii/" target="_blank">Robby Seabrook III</a></address>
      <p>You gotta have the look. Atlanta's own <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/yung-booke/">Yung Booke</a> never really wanted to rap, but his friend told him he already looked like a rapper. He brushed this off, then went on to make a diss track along with his friend about some guys at his high school. Booke became the talk of the town off the song, but his partner-in-rhyme passed away shortly after high school. Deciding to hold his friend down, he kept on rhyming and eventually spent some time signed to <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/10/t-i-cancel-culture-fake-kanye-west-gucci/">T.I.</a>'s Grand Hustle Records. Now, with his most recent project, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Goat-Explicit-Yung-Booke/dp/B07YGGQTQJ?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07YGGQTQJ">Blue Goat</a></i>, available everywhere, he came to the <i>XXL</i> office to kick a freestyle.</p>
      <p>Most of Booke's freestyle is all about the kind of life he lives. "You see me out, then you see the gang/You know it's six when you see the chain," he spits. "Let up the top when we feel the rain/You can't get wet when them shots fire/Bad bitch with me, count cash until she cockeyed."</p>
      <p>The Down South rhymer fires off some more bars that proves he's not playing any games. "Everybody shootin', hop out the whip, let it ghost ride/Real fuck wit' real and we ain't fuckin' with yo kind/We ain't playing both sides/I ain't playing at all, I'm ’bout my business, suit and bowtie."</p>
      <p>When it comes to rap, Yung Booke knew he was headed in the right direction with his 2015 track "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Y6-Freestyle-Explicit/dp/B00XIXRK7W?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B00XIXRK7W">Y6 Freestyle</a>." "The city picked it, I really didnt pick it," he shares. "I went in Club Crucial and the response I got was overwhelming. I was like, wow, I can do this."</p>
      <p>In addition to the support of his city, his family keeps him going. "I got two kids and they my biggest fans," Booke explains. "My sister, my mom and dad and my peers." Through it all, Booke will never give up. " I just stayed down with it, it's paying off," he says.</p>

      <p>"My house was $3.7 million. Then I put about $600,000 into it. That's the most I've ever spent, but I look at it as a good investment. At the end of the day, that shit already went up in value. It could be there for the kids. I don't feel like I'm playing myself no more. Just paying rent was never feeling good anyways."</p>
      <p>"Other than that, trips. Hawaii trips. I bring homies with me. I usually go like five to seven deep. It'll cost sometimes if I go on a trip. Sometimes it's around $80,000 to $100,000. Spend 100 racks on a trip, that's something you can never lose. Your watch can get taken from you, your chain can get taken, you can go to jail and they can take your home, but memories are forever."</p>
