      <p>The doppelganger of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/clemson-tigers">Clemson</a> quarterback Trevor Lawrence who went viral across social media showed up at the Tigers’ game against Wake Forest and took a picture with the national champion.</p>
      <p>Lawrence and Bella Martina – a 16-year-old girl from Georgia – met ahead of Clemson’s win. Bella went viral for her TikTok video which appears to show her looking exactly like the sophomore quarterback.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I’ve seen a lot of those,” he said, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/ToddSummers7/status/1191412107633258496">WSPA-TV</a>. “It’s crazy. That one girl actually does look like me. It’s kinda crazy but it’s funny.”</p>
      <p>Clemson’s official TikTok account also posted their own video with the woman and Lawrence side-by-side. In a separate video, the woman appeared to be shocked that Lawrence responded to her videos.</p>

      <p>Bella was also asked by <a href="https://theathletic.com/1359206/2019/11/07/clemson-football-trevor-lawrence-impressions-meet-girl-gone-viral/">The Athletic</a> what she would do if she met Lawrence.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what I would say to him [if we ever met] because I don’t know how he would react,” she said. “I’d be like, ‘Hi! My name is Bella. You’ve seen my TikToks. We have the same face.’ I’d be so overwhelmed. I might just squeal.”</p>
