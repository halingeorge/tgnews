      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German biotech company Morphosys said more patients would be recruited for a study testing its most advanced drug against a common type of blood cancer, following an encouraging interim data readout.</p>
      <p>An independent data monitoring committee recommended an increase in the number of patients to 450 from currently 330 in the ongoing trial named B-MIND, which tests the tafasitamab drug against relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma.</p>
      <p>The efficacy data that led to the committeeâ€™s endorsement was not shared with Morphosys, the company said.</p>
      <p>Its shares surged on the news, trading 10% higher at 1539 GMT.</p>
      <p>The German biotech company is using proceeds from a second listing in the United States last year to build a U.S. sales force from scratch in expectation of the launch of tafasitamab, previously known as MOR208, next year.</p>
      <p>The company suffered a recent setback when it halted development of an experimental atopic dermatitis treatment that analysts had pinned hopes of blockbuster sales potential on.</p>
