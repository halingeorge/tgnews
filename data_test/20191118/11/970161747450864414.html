      <p>In what may be one of the best value releases ever, Capcom is offering almost everything ever created for Street Fighter V in one package.</p>
      <p>The latest <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/call-duty-already-best-selling-game-2019-us-switch-best-selling-console-11165125/">NPD sales results</a> from America revealed a surprising fact, that October was the most successful month ever for fighting games in the whole of video game history.</p>
      <p>That’s primarily thanks to Mortal Kombat 11 and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate though, with Street Fighter V never quite getting over its fumbled launch.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/19/street-fighter-v-arcade-edition-review-capcoms-redemption-7241560/">Arcade Edition</a> in 2018 acted as a semi-relaunch for the game and now there’s a new version called the Champion Edition, that includes not only every fighter, including all the DLC ones, but also all the stages and costumes.</p>

      <p>There are a few exceptions, such as Capcom Pro Tour DLC, Fighting Chance costumes, and collaborations with other brands but you get all the regular stuff in one package for a staggeringly low £25 – or just £20 if you’re an existing player looking to upgrade.</p>

      <p>That means Street Fighter V: Champion Edition includes 40 fighters (including Gill, who won’t be released until next month), 34 stages, and over 200 costumes.</p>
      <p>The only downside is that the Champion Edition won’t be out until 14 February on PlayStation 4 and PC, so don’t expect to find it in your Christmas stocking.</p>
      <p>When Street Fighter V first launched there was a lot of talk from Capcom of it lasting the whole generation, but with the PlayStation 5 due out next year that inevitably leads to the question of whether Street Fighter VI is being readied to replace it.</p>
      <p>As recently as <a href="https://twitter.com/Yoshi_OnoChin/status/1154239224628912128">this summer</a> Capcom was denying it had any plans for a new game, but that’s obviously not going to be the case forever.</p>
      <p>There’s also the question of whether Street Fighter VI would still be a PlayStation 4 console exclusive, but until Capcom make an announcement it’s anyone’s guess.</p>
