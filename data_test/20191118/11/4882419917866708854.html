      <h2>Argentina face Uruguay in a friendly in Israel on Monday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:40:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Vero Brunati</a></address>
      <p>Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez will park their friendship for 90 minutes as Argentina face Uruguay in a friendly in Tel Aviv on Monday night. They finish their year with a clash which will be followed by qualifiers for the Qatar 2022 World Cup which starts in March. Coaches Lionel Scaloni (Arg) and Oscar Washington Tabarez (Uru) can use it to refine their tactical plans for the important games ahead.</p>
      <p>Argentina arrive in high morale after beating Brazil, a result fitting the rising form the country have enjoyed since Scaloni took over. He has earned 14 wins, four draws and just two defeats since taking over, finishing third in the Copa America.</p>
      <p>Uruguay, for their part, can go 2019 unbeaten if they avoid defeat, recording eight wins and four draws so far.</p>
      <p>Messi's participation is in doubt afer playing the 90 against Brazil, scoring the winner in a 1-0 victory. He took a lot of blows and had ice on his knees after training, although he is fit to play. Suarez had a more placid game against Hungary, only featuring in the first 45 mins.</p>
