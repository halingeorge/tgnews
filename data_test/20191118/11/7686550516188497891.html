      <h2>The first Amazon Black Friday deals are live and they include Shark vacuum cleaners</h2>

      <p>Amazon has started Black Friday early with the launch of discounts on Shark vacuum cleaners, toys and mobile phones.</p>
      <p>The Amazon Black Friday Countdown is now live with a series of daily deals and shorter lightning deals as it prepares for the biggest shopping day of the year on 29 November.</p>
      <p>The retailer has somewhat confusingly confirmed it will launch Black Friday deals from 22 November but has now released a host of discounts that it is calling a 'countdown' to the sale.</p>
      <p>The discounts include a big reduction on popular vacuum cleaner brand Shark, which has been praised by cleaning influencer Mrs Hitch among others as an alternative to Dyson.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2rPJwC8">Shark cordless stick vacuum cleaner</a> has been reduced from £359.99 to less than £300 for a day only in the biggest 'daily deal' on Monday 18 November.</p>

      <p>Amazon has also cut the prices of <a href="https://amzn.to/3594jiz">Samsung Galaxy 10 handsets</a> , including a 128gb version down from £800 to £614. Samsung smart watches are also reduced from £279 to £179. The watches use Bluetooth and can monitor your sleep pattern and be used as a payment system via Samsung Pay.</p>
      <p>Away from electronics Amazon has also reduced the price of <a href="https://amzn.to/37jQDmS">Playmobil toys</a> for the day. The deals include discounts on the Hawk Knights' Castle down from £89.99 to £58.99. Other Playmobil box sets have also been reduced for one day only.</p>
      <p>The Amazon deals are available early for users of <a href="https://amzn.to/2OquSsP">Amazon Prime.</a> The service also includes free delivery on most items and is available for a month completely free using a free trial.</p>
      <p>Amazon is not the first retailer to launch early Black Friday deals. Currys PC World has launched an early <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=1599&amp;clickref=Tendendo-Amazon&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.currys.co.uk%252Fgbuk%252Findex.html%5D%5D">Black Friday prices sale</a> , which it promises has cut the price of TVs and other items to prices matching those on Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Sky TV has also launched an early Black Friday set of deals including <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=11005&amp;clickref=Tendendo-Amazon&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.sky.com%252Fshop%252F%5D%5D">half price Sky Sports</a> and Netflix for just £6 a month.</p>
