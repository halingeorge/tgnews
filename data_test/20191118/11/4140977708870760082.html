                          <p>Meanwhile, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu confirmed in September that Messi has a clause in his current deal which would allow him to leave for free at the end of any given season.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>Bartomeu told Barca TV: “He signed until 2021. And it was agreed that, when the penultimate season finished, he would have the power to leave for free. He has the liberty to decide his future. But he is very ‘culé’ and I’m relaxed.”</p>
                            <p>“Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta and [Carles] Puyol had the same clause. To Messi, the best player of all time and a ‘culé’ all his life, we couldn’t give him a different clause. But I repeat: I have no doubt he will stay here for many years.</p>
                            <p>“He will be here as long as he is able to perform for Barcelona. Let’s hope we have him until he is 40 years old.” He concluded.</p>
