      <h1>Airbnb seals $500m Olympics sponsorship deal ahead of listing</h1>
      <h2>Short-stay platform’s agreement covers summer and winter games until 2028</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:00:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Murad Ahmed, Alice Hancock</a></address>
      <p>Airbnb has signed a $500m deal to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dfc917ce-bda9-11e9-b350-db00d509634e">sponsor</a> the Olympic Games until 2028, as the accommodation-booking platform targets the world’s biggest sporting event. </p>
      <p>On Monday, the San Francisco-based company announced it had joined an elite <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/903a3660-9690-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36">corporate list</a> that included Coca-Cola, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b5e16726-de1e-11e6-9d7c-be108f1c1dce">Alibaba</a> and Toyota as part of the “worldwide sponsorship programme” for the International Olympic Committee, the governing body of the games. </p>
      <p>The deal covers the next five Olympics starting with next year’s in Tokyo, and including the subsequent winter and summer games in Beijing, Paris, Milan and Los Angeles. The five cities are among Airbnb’s biggest markets for private accommodation rentals worldwide. </p>
      <p>People briefed on the negotiations valued the deal at about $500m, which includes a substantial payment to the IOC but takes into account the cost of services that Airbnb will provide, such as free accommodation to athletes and executives. </p>
      <p>The contract is in line with other recent sponsorships of the IOC, such as with Bridgestone and Panasonic, which have paid $200m-$250m over a four-year Olympic cycle. According to the IOC, its top 12 sponsors provided revenues of a little more than $1bn for the 2014 winter games in Sochi and 2016 summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
      <p>“In the past, people have travelled to the Olympics on Airbnb, of course,” said Joe Gebbia, Airbnb’s co-founder. “But we have never been able to officially market to host cities or potential hosts about the opportunity of taking visitors. Through this partnership, we actually can.”</p>
      <p>He said the company has 200,000 Airbnb hosts in the five upcoming Olympic host cities, a number he hopes to vastly increase through its IOC sponsorship.</p>

      <p>It is the first time Airbnb has signed a large sponsorship deal. The group has previously turned away approaches for broad marketing initiatives, such as working alongside airlines to create package holidays, a person familiar with the company’s thinking said.</p>
      <p>However, Airbnb executives decided the Olympics offers rare reach for a group that operates in the majority of countries and big cities across the world. </p>
      <p>Thomas Bach, IOC president, has been under pressure to institute reforms to lessen the eye-watering costs of hosting the games. He said the Airbnb deal will allow cities to avoid building new hotels, saving tens of millions of dollars in construction costs.</p>
      <p>“In terms of the visibility and sustainability of the games, I think the advantages are obvious,” Mr Bach said.</p>
      <p>The move is designed to promote Airbnb’s brand to new hosts and customers, as it prepares a listing planned for next year. The company, which was founded in 2008, has about $3.5bn of cash, providing the financial firepower for the Olympics deal, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>Last month, investors trying to buy indirect stakes in the Airbnb in private markets valued the group at <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55a444ba-0057-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">up to $42bn</a>. The US company said it had revenues of more than $1bn in the second quarter of this year. It generated profits, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation expenses, in 2017 and 2018.</p>
