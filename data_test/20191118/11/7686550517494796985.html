      <p>Celebrity X Factor has been branded a ‘disgrace’ by angered viewers after Simon Cowell ignored Vinnie Jones’ plea to ‘step down’.</p>
      <p>Jones in currently taking part in the celebrity version of the contest, which will see one lucky winner bag a record deal with Syco.</p>
      <p>After ending up in the bottom two with Kevin McHale, Vinnie begged Simon to let him go, saying: “I feel that I’ve had a fantastic time. I’ve really enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>“It’s been everything I’ve needed since my wife’s passing.</p>

      <p>“This guy [Kevin] is a real singer.</p>
      <p>“I think he could win it. For his career, I would like to step down Simon, and let him go through”.</p>
      <p>Vinnie then performed his version of Galway Shawl in the sing off, before the judges decided who they were sending home.</p>
      <p>Ignoring his plea to leave, Simon said: “This is not disrespect to Kevin. I’m voting with my heart.</p>

      <p>“I think that you can come back next week with a song.</p>
      <p>“I think you have a chance of winning this competition still.</p>
      <p>“I’m insisting please that you stay in the competition.</p>
      <p>“The act I’m sending home is Kevin.”</p>
      <p>Vinnie insisted to host Dermot that Kevin ‘was the best’ out of the two of them, but it was Kevin who was sent home after the judges’ decisions.</p>
      <p>Furious viewers took to Twitter after the elimination, with one branding the show ‘a disgrace’.</p>

      <p>One said: “Vinnie Jones had the chance to leave the show there with the highest dignity, but as far as I’m concerned, Simon Cowell has just taken that all away from him at the expense of Kevin.”</p>
      <p>Another branded Simon an ‘absolute idiot’, saying: “This whole thing is to win a record deal. And I mean Vinnie Jones yeah he’s a funny guy. But I was only watching because Kevin McHale was in it who by the way is the best singer/performer on the whole show.”</p>
      <p>Dancing on Ice star James Jordan tweeted: “I’m a massive Vinnie Jones fan and have huge empathy for him but surely it’s a singing competition.”</p>
      <p>Another furious viewer branded Simon ‘deluded’ after the decision, saying: “Kevin McHale of Glee gives the best sing off performance of the series against Vinnie Jones who asked to be sent home and Simon... sends home Kevin? It is not possible for someone to be this deluded? Worst thing I've ever seen.”</p>
