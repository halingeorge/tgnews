      <p>Sevilla midfielder Ever Banega revealed Lionel Messi's greatest virtue.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Goal, Banega spoke about his Argentina captain, with whom he is good friends.</p>
      <p>"Yes, I don't think there's anyone like him," said Banega. "The truth is that for everything he does and the time he's spent among the best, yes I think he's the best."</p>
      <p>Banega explained Messi's virtue is that "in humility, Messi never changes. We always greet each other with a hug when we cross paths and never speak about football, instead our families and how we are."</p>
