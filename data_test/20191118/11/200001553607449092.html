      <p>Willian once again finds himself on the front page of a Spanish newspaper.</p>
      <p>Monday’s edition of <a href="http://mundodeportivo.com/">Mundo Deportivo</a> has the Chelsea attacker plastered across the cover, along with Napoli midfielder Fabian Ruiz.</p>
      <p>The claim is that both players are holding back on contract renewals because they want to give Barcelona a chance to make a move for them.</p>

      <p>According to the Catalan newspaper, Willian is ‘happy’ at Stamford Bridge, but still has a ‘dream’ of signing for Barcelona, and is aware that a free transfer would make it much likelier.</p>
      <p>Chelsea may not be prepared to wait endlessly for agreement on that renewal offer.</p>
