      <h1>Collymore says Liverpool’s Oxlade-Chamberlain can be England’s new Gascoigne</h1>

      <p>Stan Collymore reckons Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is the closest thing England have to a modern-day Paul Gascoigne.</p>
      <p>The ex-Red made the observation <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-closest-england-20899542">in a column for The Mirror</a>, before the Three Lions beat Kosovo 4-0 to win their Euro 2020 qualifying group on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain started in Pristina and received the highest rating of any player from BBC Sport after the game.</p>
      <p>He also started against Montenegro days earlier, and Collymore reckons he has the potential to provide the wow factor for his country as Gascoigne so often did in the 90s.</p>
      <p>He said: “As for Montenegro, they were ­disappointing and the game left me feeling that we still desperately need a player who can run with the ball from the halfway line to the edge of the opponents’ box next summer. A Paul Gascoigne-type figure.</p>

      <p>“The one man who can do it is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>
      <p>“Now, I’m not comparing him to Gazza, but what I am saying is that he gave us a taster last week of his ability to run with the ball and commit midfielders and defenders – and that’s not something any England player has done well for a long time.</p>
      <p>“Maddison and Mount do it from time to time, but not in the same way as the Ox, who can run past players at pace.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Bold comments</h3>
      <p>Collymore says he isn’t comparing, but his comments are unlikely to go down well.</p>

      <p>Gascoigne was one of the most naturally gifted players of his generation, and so the bar is very high.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain – who earns £120,000-a-week at Anfield (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/liverpool-f.c/payroll/">Spotrac</a>) – is a fine player and he might share traits with Gascoigne, but hyping him up as the potential second coming is probably unwise.</p>
