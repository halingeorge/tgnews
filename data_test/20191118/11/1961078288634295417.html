      <p>In the satirical Video Op-Ed above, cancel culture is reimagined with the help of a medieval mob. Pray thee, the video begs, is there any room left for transgression?</p>
      <p>These days, it seems like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html?module=inline">everyone’s being canceled</a> — from celebrities like Louis C.K. and Kanye West to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/style/cancel-culture.html?module=inline">ordinary high-schoolers</a>. Some cancellations are temporary (we’re looking at you, Aziz Ansari). Some seem permanent (has anyone even <i>seen</i> R. Kelly?). But all are very public. And rarely is an apology good enough. Even more rare: redemption.</p>
      <p>Last month, former President Barack Obama <a href="https://twitter.com/attn/status/1189349299118727168">urged young people to leave cancel culture behind</a>. “This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff” he said, “you should get over that quickly.”</p>
      <p>A mob quickly rose to the defense of cancel culture, sprinkled with a bit of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/opinion/obama-cancel-culture.html?module=inline">“O.K. Boomer”</a> judgment. For a brief moment, we wondered: Could even President Obama be canceled?</p>
