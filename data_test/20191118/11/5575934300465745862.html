      <p>China is trying to reduce its dependency on America.</p>
      <p>According to economists at ANZ, the trade war is causing the world’s second-biggest economy to move away from the dollar, and instead upping its holdings of other foreign currencies.</p>
      <p>“The ongoing trade war and geopolitical issues have increased the risk of a financial decoupling between China and the US,” said Raymond Yeung, Greater China chief economist, in a note.</p>
      <p>“Although China still allocates a high share of its FX exchange reserves to the US dollar, estimated at around 59% as of June 2019, the pace of diversification into other currencies will likely quicken going forward,” Yeung said.</p>
      <p>China’s currency, the yuan, is dollar-pegged currently and in the last year became a weapon to fight back against Trump’s trade war. In August, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trade-war-china-currency-hits-7-per-dollar-for-first-time-in-11-years-2019-8-1028416373">China let its currency fall</a>, letting it decline to make Chinese goods cheaper to export, and American goods more expensive in light of tariff hikes – a move that shocked markets.</p>
      <p>“The Chinese government has already discreetly diversified its offshore portfolios to include alternative investments,” Yeung said, roughly 1.8 trillion yuan worth ($US256 billion) since June.</p>
      <p>The ANZ economist added, “China has been a major contributor to the global savings glut,” saying that excessive savings led to mass capital flows towards American households and low-interest rates. Yeung also said there’s been a “significant amount” invested from China’s manufacturing sector to US government bonds.</p>
      <p>He said this trend, which his team nicknamed, “factory-dollar recycling,” has contributed to “the global prominence of the US dollar over the past decade. However, if China initiates a convertible standard superior to the fiat-money regime, not only will it gain a market following, but it will also boost the global acceptance of the RMB.”</p>
