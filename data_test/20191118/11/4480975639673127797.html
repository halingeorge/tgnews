      <h1>UK PM Johnson: Postponing further cuts in corporation tax</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:10:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>While speaking business leaders at a conference organised by Britain's main business lobby, the CBI, on Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that they will be postponing further cuts in corporation tax.</p>
      <p>"Pausing cuts in corporation tax is fiscally responsible, it does not mean we are averse to reducing taxes on business," Johnson further explained, per Reuters.</p>
      <p>These comments had little to no impact on the British pound's market valuation. As of writing, the GBP/USD pair was trading at 1.2965, adding 0.52% on a daily basis.</p>
