      <p>Mitsubishi has given its Mirage hatchback a fresh set of tweaks ahead of 2020.</p>
      <p>Initially introduced in 2012, the most notable change to the refreshed Mirage is the introduction of Mitsubishi’s corporate front fascia. Chrome strakes flank a blacked-out grille, with two red horizontal stripes sitting at either side of the badge.</p>

      <p>Reshaped headlamps have been introduced, while the rear of the car sees a squared-off bumper brought in in a bid to give it a ‘wider and more stable look’.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the visual changes to the car is a set of fresh 15-inch alloy wheels, while customers can now opt for two new colours: White Diamond or Sand Yellow.</p>

      <p>Inside the car, a new armrest has been thrown in while cloth has been used on the previously exposed plastic ‘hand-touch’ areas. A carbon fibre-effect pattern has been added around the window switch panel, with a combination fabric and synthetic leather upholstery introduced too.</p>
      <p>A new touchscreen infotainment system has also been introduced to the car, featuring support for both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.</p>

      <p>No word on any new powertrains for this iteration of the Mitsubishi Mirage as yet, so it’s fair to assume it will retain the existing car’s 1.2-litre, naturally-aspirated petrol engine with the option of a five-speed manual or CVT gearbox.</p>
      <p>Pricing and specifications for the new Mitsubishi Mirage will be revealed in early 2020, with its arrival in showrooms likely to follow shortly after.</p>
