      <p>A suspected stolen car smashed into a hair salon during an early morning police chase.</p>
      <p>A black Vauxhall Corsa crashed into Viva hair salon on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Union Street, Southport</a> , at around 2.15am, with the driver then fleeing from the scene on foot.</p>
      <p>A male passenger suffered a head injury in the crash.</p>
      <p>The car was believed to have been stolen from Janes Brook Road shortly before and was spotted by patrols on Seabank Road.</p>

      <p>A short pursuit followed before the car smashed into the shop front and destroyed a lamppost in the process.</p>
      <p>The passenger, a 48-year-old man, was taken to hospital for treatment and is said to be in a stable condition.</p>
      <p>The driver of the car has not yet been located and efforts to locate him are ongoing.</p>
      <p>Images show the devastating damage caused to the salon - with some of Southport's brand-new Christmas lights also ruined in the smash.</p>
      <p>Vivien Sebasianelli owned the shop for 27 years before recently handing over the reigns to her daughter.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Visiter later that morning, she remained defiant in the face of the setback.</p>
      <p>She said: “At about 3am, the police rang and said there’d been an incident. Police were chasing two men in the car and it turned sideways and came through the windows. <br/> </p>

      <p>“We’ve had trouble before with people throwing bins at the windows and fighting in the street but never anything like this.”</p>
      <p>Viven added: “We’ve just got to keep going and keep smiling. We can’t let them hold us back.”</p>
      <p>Enquiries into the incident are ongoing and police are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>Anyone who witnessed the incident or has dashcam footage is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC.</p>
