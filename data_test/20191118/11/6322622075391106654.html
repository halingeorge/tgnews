      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): GD Express Carrier Bhd’s (GDeX) net profit shrunk 26.44% to RM4.76 million in the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (1QFY20), from RM6.47 million in the same period last year, due to margin squeeze.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share, accordingly, was down to 0.08 sen, from 0.12 sen, a filing with Bursa Malaysia showed.</p>
      <p>GDex attributed the narrower profit margin to investment into human capital to build a stronger regional team, investment in IT and other infrastructure. The company also blamed increasingly intense competition to lower pricing to win market share, as another factor.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue, however, grew 11.45% to RM83.04 million from RM74.51 million, on increase in demand for courier services for both its B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-consumer) segments.</p>
      <p>On prospects, the group is pro-active and will continue to invest in human capital, IT infrastructure and regional expansion towards a commitment for a strong intra-Asean delivery network.</p>
      <p>“This will ensure the growth and sustainability of the business, despite intense competitive environment in the industry,” GDeX said, adding that the group remains focused on maintaining the growth of B2B and B2C segments, with a more customer centric approach, to win market share.</p>
      <p>Shares of GDeX dropped 0.5 sen or 1.8% at 28.5 sen today, valuing the company at RM1.61 billion.</p>
