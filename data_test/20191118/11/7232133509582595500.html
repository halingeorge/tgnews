        <li>EOS is slightly recovering as bulls seem to be back in the game</li>
        <li>The short-term correction is keeping EOS on suspense for a major bullish move</li>

      <p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/18/crypto-market-and-bitcoin-might-decline-further-bch-eos-trx-ada-analysis/">EOS has seen relatively strong growth</a> of about 23% after establishing a mid-year low at around $2.4 on September 25.</p>
      <p>Recently, the price of EOS stalled around $3.5, currently the monthly high. The cryptocurrency has increased by 2.37%, now trading at the $3.47 price level. The 7th largest cryptocurrency in the global market is likely to recover above key resistance levels if the market corrects gains.</p>
      <h3>EOS Price Prediction</h3>
      <p>Looking into the daily chart, EOS has been shaping inside a descending channel since July but the price has recently been up for a while now. Meanwhile, the last six weeks of trading have positioned the asset on an uptrend, which makes the price to test the channel’s resistance at $3.5 earlier this month.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the EOS/USD pair has gained support at $3.4, followed by $3.2. If the token corrects below this mentioned support, the next low may be located at $2.5. A further drive may cause the market to plunge at the channel’s lower boundary.</p>
      <p>However, the cryptocurrency is currently demonstrating <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/a-mysterious-airdrop-called-eidos-is-clogging-eos-to-make-a-point">bearish movement</a> on the hourly chart. If the price can stay well above $3, the EOS market is expected to bounce back to $3.65. A price surge could move the token out of the channel boundary to $4 and $4.6 resistance levels. All in all, the bulls seem to be stepping back into the market.</p>
      <p>EOS is ready for a positive breakout on the daily chart but it appears that the recent price drop is keeping the bulls waiting. If the asset can surpass the $0.365 price levels, the price could demonstrate an extended rally before the end of the year. Inversely, a rejection may lead the market to serious price reductions.</p>
