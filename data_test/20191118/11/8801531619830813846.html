      <h1>Country Being Defamed And Image Of The Prime Minister Being Tarnished"; PIL In Bombay HC Seeks Ban On Tiktok</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:22:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:22</time> by <a rel="author">Nitish Kashyap</a></address>
      <p>Heena Darvesh, a Mumbai resident has filed a Public Interest Litigation before the Bombay High Court seeking a ban on the popular mobile app "TikTok".</p>
      <p>The PIL claims that the Chinese application which has over 200 million users worldwide, is affecting the youth of the country as it is addictive which leads to degradation of mental health.</p>
      <p>According to the PIL filed on November 11, innumerable deaths and accidents have been caused due to TikTok. The PIL claims that national integrity is in danger, Hindu-Muslim enmity is being promoted, youth of the country is being destroyed, "our country is defamed in the whole world" and "the Prime Minister's image is getting tarnished."</p>
      <p>On April 3, 2019 the Madurai bench passed an ex-parte order directing the Government to ban the application. The bench noted, "the application is dangerous for children in view of inappropriate contents including language and pornography being posted in the application."</p>
      <p>However, the company that owns the application - Bytedance (India) Technology Private Limited filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court against the ban directed by the Madurai bench.</p>
      <p>The apex court refused to stay the order and directed the Madras High Court to consider the matter. The Madras High Court then lifted the ban on April 24.</p>
      <p>Ironically, the PIL also claims that a lot of public money, through the judiciary and executive,is being wasted as plenty of cases have been filed against TikTok.</p>
      <p>Advocate Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh is appearing on behalf of the petitioner. Speaking to Livelaw, Deshmukh said - "We will not be waiting for the CMIS date, I will mention the matter tomorrow at 11 am before the bench headed by Justice SC Dharmadhikari."</p>
