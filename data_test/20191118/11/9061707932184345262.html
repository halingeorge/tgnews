      <p>A deal expected to be worth billions of pounds has been secured by <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/rolls-royce">Rolls-Royce in Derby</a>.</p>
      <p>Dubai-based airline Emirates has signed an agreement to buy 50 A350 Airbus A350-900s, which will all be powered by Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB engines, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/sinfin">designed and built in Sinfin</a>.</p>
      <p>The precise value of the deal is undisclosed but could be in the billions of pounds.</p>
      <p>The contract for the fleet of aircraft was signed at the Dubai Air Show, taking place this week, by Emirates chief executive and chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum and Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury.</p>
      <p>Rolls-Royce is the sole engine supplier for the A350.</p>
      <p>The Trent XWB engine was designed and developed at its civil aerospace site in Sinfin where it is also built.</p>
      <p>Sheikh Ahmed said: “Today, we are pleased to sign a firm order for 50 A350 XWBs, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. <br/><br/>“This follows a thorough review of various aircraft options and of our own fleet plans.</p>
      <p>“It is Emirates’ long-standing strategy to invest in modern and efficient aircraft and we are confident in the performance of the A350 XWB. <br/><br/>“Complementing our A380s and 777s, the A350s will give us added operational flexibility in terms of capacity, range and deployment.</p>
      <p>“In effect, we are strengthening our business model to provide efficient and comfortable air transport services to, and through, our Dubai hub.” <br/><br/>The A350 features the latest aerodynamic design and a carbon fibre fuselage and wings.</p>
      <p>Together with its Trent XWB engines, these technologies result in 25% lower operating costs, as well as 25% reduction in fuel burn and carbon emissions compared with previous-generation competing aircraft, according to Airbus.</p>
      <p>Dubai-based airline Emirates first announced its intention to order the aircraft in February.</p>
      <p>Mr Faury said: “We are honoured by Emirates’ strong vote of confidence in our newest widebody aircraft, taking our partnership to the next level. <br/><br/>“The A350 will bring unbeatable economics and environmental benefits to their fleet. We look forward to seeing the A350 flying in Emirates colours.”</p>
