      <h3>When given the opportunity to capture gameplay, you capture gameplay.</h3>
      <p>Stevivor attended X019 in London last week, and as a result, we’ve a ton of new gameplay to show off to you. Titles include <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/bleeding-edge/">Bleeding Edge</a>, <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/halo-reach/">Halo Reach</a>, <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/kartracer-drift/">KartRacer Drift</a>, <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/tunic/">Tunic</a>, <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/carrion/">Carrion</a> </i>and <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-resistance/">Project Resistance</a>.</i></p>
      <p>Without further adieu, you can find it all below. Expect proper previews in the days to come.</p>
      <h4>Bleeding Edge X019 gameplay</h4>
      <p>Of note here is the newly announced character Cass. We were also able to spend a large chunk of time in the in-game Dojo ahead of the actual match, useful for testing out characters and their abilities.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/bleeding-edge/">Bleeding Edge</a> </i>heads to both Windows PC and Xbox One on 24 March 2020.</p>

      <h4>Halo Reach PC X019 gameplay</h4>
      <p>Stevivor was able to go hands-on with <i>Halo: Reach </i>on PC at X019. Check out action from the Winter Contingency level below.</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/halo-reach/"><i>Halo Reach</i></a> will be added to <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection/"><i>Halo The Master Chief Collection</i></a> on 3 December across both Windows PC via the Microsoft Store &amp; Steam and Xbox One.</p>

      <h4>KartRacer Drift X019 gameplay</h4>
      <p>Developed by Nexon, <i>KartRacer Drift </i>is a westernised version of a popular Korean karting game named <i>Crazyracing Kartrider</i>, a title that’s been available in various forms since 2004.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/kartracer-drift/">KartRacer Drift</a> </i>will heads to Windows PC and Xbox One in 2020; a closed beta takes place between 5-8 December.</p>

      <h4>Tunic X019 gameplay</h4>
      <p>The ever-charming <i>Tunic </i>featured at X019, and Stevivor jumped at the chance to capture gameplay from it. If you’re not picking up on the massive <i>Zelda </i>vibes coming from this title, largely developed by the singular Andrew Shouldice, we don’t know what to tell you.</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/tunic/"><i>Tunic</i></a> doesn’t have a release date as yet but it planned for release on Windows PC, Mac and Xbox One.</p>

      <h4>Carrion X019 gameplay</h4>
      <p>We delighted at the chance to play Phobia Game Studio’s <i>Carrion, </i>a title in which you play as the same type of biohazardous blob that usually ends up the final boss battle of a <i>Resident Evil</i>-style game. Check out the carnage below.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/carrion/">Carrion</a> </i>will head to Windows PC and Xbox One in 2020.</p>

      <h4>Project Resistance X019 gameplay</h4>
      <p>Stevivor was lucky enough to capture <i>Project Resistance </i>gameplay as both a survivor and a Mastermind; both are below.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-resistance/">Project Resistance</a> </i>is a 4v1 experience announced by Capcom at Tokyo Game Show 2019. It’s planned for Windows PC, Xbox One and PS4.</p>
