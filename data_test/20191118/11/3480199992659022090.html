      <p>“That was the Model T. Today, the Ford Motor Company is proud to unveil a car that strikes like forked lightning all over again. The all-new, all-electric, Mustang Mach-E. It’s fast. It’s fun. It’s freedom. For a new generation of Mustang owners.”</p>
      <p>Inside, the Mach-E benefits from a 15.5-inch infotainment screen with touch, swipe and pinch controls which, Ford state that ‘every smartphone owner will be comfortable using’.</p>
      <p>First deliveries are expected to commence in October next year, with prices likely to start around £40,000.</p>
