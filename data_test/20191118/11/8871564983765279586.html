      <h1>American boutique hotel brand, The Standard, has landed in the Maldives and it looks amazing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:31:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coco%20Travel" target="_blank">Coco Travel</a></address>
      <p>American boutique hotel brand, The Standard, has opened up for business in the Maldives and based on a quick visual tour of the premises, it looks like the tropical, idyllic island destination of our dreams — with a funky, fresh aesthetic that The Standard is known for, making for a fun twist on the typical, ahem, <i>standard</i> bungalow-look we’re used to seeing for Maldives properties.</p>

      <p>Although it’s called The Standard, the small chain, known for its cool locations in New York City, LA, and Miami Beach, its style is anything but conventional and boring. The brand’s island destination, which just officially opened up on November 1, seems to follow suit, keeping the aesthetic funky and fresh — for instance, there’s a disco ball above the bathtub in each villa.</p>
      <p>Situated between the Raa and Baa Atolls on a naturally protected island, The Standard Huruvalhi Maldives has 115 villas, that are a mix of beachside and over-water, each with their own infinity plunge pool, private deck and — the best part in our opinion — direct lagoon, ocean, or beach access.</p>
      <p>Getting there is a small adventure in and of itself and involves taking a 35-minute sea plane from Velana International Airport. Alternatively, you can get there from a 20-minute domestic flight to Dharavandhoo and 35-minute speedboat ride to the resort.</p>
      <p>Have a look around and try not to drool too much (ngl, we’re salivating):</p>

      <p>Notice how those waters are clear AF? The reef around the resort is protected and makes a prime snorkeling spot. (Looks like the resort takes its obligation to conservation seriously as it has its own lagoon coral nursery with over 3,000 juvenile corals; tip of the hat to them for that.) Snorkeling and diving excursions from the resort are also an option for the more adventurous, as well as boat trips to uninhabited islands. Meanwhile, there’s recreational equipment available like glass bottom kayaks, jet skis, and windsurfers for the more active traveler. For the family, there’s an 82-square meter inflatable water park that can be reached by pontoon (and there’s also a kids club for parents in need of some R&amp;R). Plus, there’s pool parties for those feeling social. And of course, there’s a spa for some self-care time (um, yes please!).</p>

      <p>Being on a little island, you would think there’s not exactly a bunch of dining options around, but the resort actually has six different restaurants to meet different needs and tastes. Some of the ingredients are even sourced from the resort’s own island farm. If you want to get some culture in, prioritize eating at GUDUGUDA, a Maldivian restaurant, said to be the first of its kind. Food there is made by Maldivian “aunties”. Think locally caught, seafood, coconut-milk curries, and aromatic rice dishes. Also in the restaurant lineup is a beachside BBQ shack — called Shak — for grilled seafood, along with a poolside bar, a another bar featuring craft cocktails, and and adults-only over-water-club.</p>

      <p>As the resort is still in its opening phase, they are offering special rates from US$395 a night in one of the private villas along with buffet breakfast included.</p>
