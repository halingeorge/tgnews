      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State on his re-election in the November 16 gubernatorial poll.</p>
      <p>The President described the election and emergence of the All Progressives Congress candidate as “a race well run and a victory well won.”</p>
      <p>Buhari commended APC supporters for remaining steadfast and resolute even in the face of isolated incidents of violence.</p>
      <p>Buhari condoled with the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives as a result of regrettable acts of violence by thugs doing the bidding of their political sponsors.</p>
      <p>According to the President: “All political actors and stakeholders must take deliberate steps to eschew electoral violence as a peaceful and orderly process is vital to our quest for enduring democracy.”</p>
      <p>He saluted officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies for creditably discharging their responsibilities under difficult conditions.</p>
      <p>President Buhari urged Bello to see his renewed mandate as another opportunity to build on the foundations already laid towards improving the lives of the people of Kogi State.</p>
      <p>He also enjoined the governor to imbibe the spirit of magnanimity in victory by extending a hand of partnership to opposition candidates, while urging those dissatisfied with the outcome of the election to approach the courts.</p>
