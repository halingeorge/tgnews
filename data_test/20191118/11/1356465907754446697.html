      <h1>Dutch VC firm Borski Fund raises €21 million fund to blow wind in the sails of female founders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:36:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tech.eu/author/robin/" target="_blank">Robin Wauters</a></address>
      <p>Dutch investment firm <a href="https://borskifund.com/">Borski Fund</a> has raised 21 million euros to invest in female-led startups, which it claims is the first such initiative to stimulate women entrepreneurship in The Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The three leading Dutch banks – ABN Amro, <a href="https://www.ing.com/Newsroom/News/ING-joins-group-investing-in-female-entrepreneurs.htm">ING</a> and Rabobank – have all committed to the fund, which is named after banker extraordinaire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_Borski">Johanna Borski</a>, investing €5 million each. Other backers include Van Lanschot, family offices and “a large number of informal investors” which were not named.</p>
      <p>The Borski Fund is an initiative by <a href="https://thenextwomen.com/">The Next Women</a>, a network for female entrepreneurship in the Netherlands, and StartGreen Capital, the largest fund manager focused on sustainability in the country.</p>
      <p>Simone Brummelhuis (founder of The Next Women and initiator of the Borski Fund), comments on the need for a female-focused fund thusly:</p>
      <p>“Venture capital investors are mostly men, who are often inclined to invest into like-minded peers. As a result, female entrepreneurs sometimes even refrain from seeking funding from these parties, and therefore often do not raise the venture capital that they deserve.”</p>
      <p>The firm aims to ‘stimulate the power of female entrepreneurs and gender-diverse teams’, and to financially aid them in their growth. Brummelhuis says her work with The Next Women demonstrated a need, and expects plenty of interest and sufficient deal flow for the fresh fund as a result.</p>
