      <h1>Modders already adding cut Pokémon into Sword and Shield</h1>
      <h2>The internet asked Furret.</h2>

      <p>Pokémon fans weren't happy to discover <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-04-watch-out-the-pokemon-sword-and-shield-leaks-are-everywhere">the latest entries to the series wouldn't contain every Pokémon ever made</a>, and now a modder has taken it upon himself to start putting the cut creatures back in.</p>
      <p>Michael (<a href="https://twitter.com/SciresM">@SciresM</a>) on Twitter recently posted a thread showing an Omastar he's managed to import into the game, the model for which was essentially copy pasted from Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee.</p>

      <p>In the video above, Michael has edited a Yamper using save editor, PKHeX, to add Omastar's model - the latter hasn't replaced the former however, Omastar has been inserted into the game's model table with its unique species ID.</p>
      <p>The modder claims it took about an hour to get to the point the Omastar is at in the tweets, though it still needs a lot more work to get the Pokémon's animations working properly, as the Let's Go models don't have animations for some of Sword and Shield's new features (like Dynamaxing).</p>
      <p>"Point of this was mostly just to demonstrate that adding new models/animations is possible to justify further work towards natdex," he says in a follow up tweet.</p>

      <p>It's worth noting this method might not be so easy for a lot of the other Pokémon in the National Pokédex, however - any Pokémon that don't have a 3D model for Switch already would likely need new ones made, and it's unknown right now if models from the older 3DS titles could be imported as easily.</p>
      <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield is out now for Nintendo Switch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-13-pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-a-shadow-of-a-former-great">Chris Tapsell touches on the #Dexit controversy in our review</a>:</p>
      <p>"In essence, despite the clamour and the rage, the lack of a National Pokédex is not the problem. The real problem with Pokémon Sword and Shield lies much deeper, or rather where that depth ought to be."</p>
