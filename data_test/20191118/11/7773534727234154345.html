        <b>The first drug to treat disease progression in patients with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis was among five new medicines recommended for use in Europe on Friday. </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mayzent </b>(siponimoid), <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/fda_approves_novartis_next-gen_ms_drug_mayzent_1282733">developed</a> by Swiss pharma Novartis, has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).</p>
      <p>SPMS is typically characterised by an irreversible decline of neurological functions – if Mayzent receives approval from the EMA, which is likely following the CHMP recommendation, it will become the first oral treatment for this type of MS in Europe.</p>
      <p>“Today’s CHMP opinion marks a milestone in supporting people in Europe who are living with active SPMS,” said Christoph Thalheim, director of external affairs, European Multiple Sclerosis Platform.</p>
      <p>“Today’s CHMP opinion marks a milestone in supporting people in Europe who are living with active SPMS,” he added.</p>
      <p>Roche’s <b>Polivy </b>(polatuzumab vedotin) has also been <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/roches_polivy_gets_fda_okay_for_lymphoma_chemo-immunotherapy_1290491">granted</a> a conditional marketing authorisation for the treatment of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma – a rare type of cancer that affects white blood cells.</p>
      <p>Following this conditional approval, a final decision regarding Polivy is expected from the European Commission in the near future.</p>
      <p>Polivy's recommendation is based on the results from Roche’s phase 1b/2 GO29365 study, which showed that 40% of people treated with the drug, plus bendamustine and rituximab (BR), achieved a complete response, compared to 17.5% of those treated only with BR.</p>
      <p>This means that no cancer could be detected at the time of assessment – a significant benefit for patients with otherwise limited treatment options.</p>
      <p>Novartis Europharm also gained a marketing authorisation for <b>Isturisa </b>(osilodrostat) for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome – a rare disorder that occurs when the body produces too much corticosteroid hormones. This in turn leads to weight gain, fat build-up on the face and bruising.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the new medicines approval was Jazz Pharmaceutical’s <b>Sunosi </b>(solriamfetol), which gained a positive opinion for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy, a sleep disorder that causes individuals to fall asleep suddenly, and obstructive sleep apnoea.</p>
      <p>The CHMP also recommended marketing authorisations for two generic medicines – Mylan’s <b>Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic acid Mylan </b>(clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic acid) for the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events and Accord’s Healthcare’s <b>Deferasirox Accord</b> (deferasirox) for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions in patients with beta thalassaemia and other anaemia types.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Safety reviews of Lemtrada and Xeljanz</b>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to approving a number of new drugs, the CHMP also restricted the use of two medicines.</p>
      <p>This includes Sanofi Genzyme’s multiple sclerosis medicine <b><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/tags/lemtrada?tag=TGVtdHJhZGE=&amp;cachebuster=667779317">Lemtrada</a> </b>(alemtuzumab), which now has restricted use due to reports of rare but serious side effects, including death. The side effects include cardiovascular disorders and immune-related disorders.</p>
      <p>Lemtrada is now restricted for use only in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS if the disease is highly active, despite treatment with at least one disease-modifying therapy, or if the disease is worsening rapidly.</p>
      <p>It is also restricted for use by patients with certain heart, circulation or bleeding disorders, or in patients who have autoimmune disorders other than MS.</p>
      <p>Also receiving a recommendation for restriction is Pfizer’s rheumatoid arthritis medication <b>Xeljanz </b>(tofacitinib), after the EMA concluded that it could <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/ema_could_follow_fdas_xeljanz_blood_clot_warning_1279718">increase the risk of blood clots</a> in the lungs and deep veins in high-risk patients.</p>
      <p>This follows the FDA in the US issuing a formal warning about the risks of the JAK inhibitor earlier this year, after a post-marketing study if the drug showed a 10mg dose could increase the risk of life-threatening blood clots.</p>
      <p>The agency is recommending that Xeljanz should now be used with caution in all high-risk patients, and that the maintenance doses of 10mg twice daily should not be used in patients with ulcerative colitis – unless there is no alternative treatment.</p>
