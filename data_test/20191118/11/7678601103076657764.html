      <p>Batik Air, a subsidiary of low-cost carrier Lion Air, has launched in-flight Wi-Fi dubbed the Wireless Fidelity Entertainment Onboard as part of its ongoing efforts to improve passenger convenience, with a test run scheduled for three of its Airbus planes.</p>
      <p>Batik Air CEO Ahmad Luthfie said in a statement that the new service could already be accessed on several flight routes, including Jakarta-Makassar, South Sulawesi; Jakarta-Gorontalo; and Gorontalo-Jakarta. The service would soon be made available on more routes, he added.</p>

      <p>In cooperation with Airfi Indonesia and Batam Aero Technic, the service allows passengers to stream movies, TV shows, music, games and social media through their mobile devices.</p>
      <p>As a safety measure, the airline calls on its customers to make sure that the internet connection on their mobile devices remain disabled during flights. To access the in-flight Wi-Fi, Ahmad said customers could simply enable the airplane mode on their devices, then select "Batik Entertainment" on the list of available Wi-Fi connections.</p>
      <p>Ahmad went on to say that customers were not allowed to access private information in order to prevent any violations of privacy.</p>
      <p>The in-flight Wi-Fi would be improved to accommodate online transactions such as booking hotel rooms and rental cars, he added. (rfa/kes)</p>
