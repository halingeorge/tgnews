      <h1>Tesla's S-3-X-Y Lineup Is About To Get A Lot Smaller</h1>
      <h2>With a new diecast collection.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:02:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Last week Tesla announced some big news that it would finally begin selling its long-anticipated second-generation <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/roadster">Roadster</a> model. Well, not really. The real car still has a ways to go before it is ready for production but just in time for the holidays, Tesla will begin selling a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-finally-ready-to-sell-its-new-roadster">1:18 scale diecast model</a> for $250. This may be a bit expensive for a toy car but the diecast Roadster includes some amazing attention to detail such as a realistic interior, opening doors, removable roof, carpeted trunk and interior, and fabric seat belts.</p>
      <p>We think the model would make an excellent gift for someone waiting to receive their real-life car but Tesla's diecast collection doesn't stop at the Roadster. In fact, Tesla now offers nearly its entire S-3-X-Y lineup as diecast models available for purchase on its website.</p>

      <p>Of the current Tesla models, you can now buy diecast versions of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-s">Model S</a>, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-3">Model 3</a>, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-x">Model X</a> in various colors, though the Model Y remains absent from the lineup. The Model 3 is offered in white, black, grey, blue, and red; the Model S comes in grey, black, white, blue, and red; while the Model X is only available in white or grey. Tesla says the Model 3 diecast models represent the Performance variant while the Model S and X represent the P100D variants (which now carry the 'Performance' moniker too).</p>
      <p>In addition to the 1:18 scale versions of the existing cars, Tesla will also offer a 1:24 scale version of its <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/get-a-closer-look-at-the-tesla-semi-out-in-the-wild">upcoming Semi truck</a>. It is available for the same $250 amount as the other models and is only available in silver.</p>

      <p>As with the other models, Tesla says the diecast model of the Semi truck was made using 3D CAD data from the real version to replicate every detail, curve, and surface. The model features reverse-opening suicide doors just like the real truck and a detailed interior with a center-seating position. Tesla says it measures 292 mm long x 124 mm wide x 172 mm high and weighs 3.3 pounds, which is significantly more than the Roadster diecast.</p>
