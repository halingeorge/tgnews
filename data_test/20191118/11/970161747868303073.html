      <p>The owner of a cat deliberately mauled to death by a dog ‘screamed his head off’ when he saw the attack on CCTV.</p>
      <p>Gary Truefitt, 60, said he ‘couldn’t believe’ what he was seeing as he watched Amos Price, 30, encourage his lurcher-type dog to go after cat Cleo.</p>
      <p>The thug was filmed opening a gate to let his dog into the garden, in Walsall, West Midlands, before dragging it over to Mr Truefitt’s pet, triggering the mauling.</p>
      <p>He was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/thug-caught-cctv-urging-dog-maul-cat-death-jailed-11126600/">sentenced to 18 weeks behind bars</a> after he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.</p>
      <p>Mr Truefitt said he thought Price should have jailed for more than a year, calling his actions that night ‘disgusting’.</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘It would give me some sort of closure if I could have her cremated, if I knew where her body was.</p>

      <p>‘The dog carried her off after it killed her.’</p>
      <p>He added his life now felt ’empty’ without Cleo, having previously told the court he was struggling to sleep.</p>
      <p>Mr Truefitt said: ‘She’s not there when I wake up in the morning, laying there on the bed. It just seems totally different in my flat now.’</p>
      <p>Price claimed in court he was drunk at the time of the attack and would not have committed the offence had he been sober.</p>

      <p>Defence lawyer Mandeep Sehmi said the father-of-two had since received death threats, after RSPCA released the CCTV footage during a call for his arrest.</p>
      <p>Passing sentence, chairman of the bench Brian Benton told Price that the Walsall Magistrates’ Court was restricted to a maximum sentence of 26 weeks.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Due to your guilty plea, you are entitled to a reduction of one-third, to 18 weeks.</p>
      <p>‘However, due to the circumstances, we would if we were actually permitted to do so have imposed a far greater custodial sentence.’</p>
      <p>Price was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £122 and £250 in compensation to Mr Truefitt.</p>
      <p>He blew a kiss towards the public gallery as he was taken to the cells.</p>
