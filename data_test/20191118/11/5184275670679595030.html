      <h1>Bigg Boss 13: Salman Khan To QUIT The Show? Says, “I’ve Had Enough”</h1>
      <h2>The rumour of 'Salman Khan not hosting the next season' is repeating itself since years now</h2>

      <p>Salman Khan-led Bigg Boss 13 is enjoying a great run at the TV as the show is garnering good TRPs since the last few weeks. Inclusion of Hindustani Bhau, entertainment by Sidharth Shukla and more, the show is proving true to its ‘colours’ for being a pop-corn watch.</p>
      <p>The rumour of ‘Salman Khan not hosting the next season’ is repeating itself since years now. Salman has previously clarified that he thinks about hosting the show every year; somehow, the makers have managed to not let him go. The cast of the upcoming film <i>Paagalpanti</i> was present at yesterday’s episode of Bigg Boss 13.</p>

      <p>At the event, Salman Khan was asked, “Till date, how many seasons of Bigg Boss has Salman Khan hosted?”, and to this, Anil Kapoor says, “Dus” (10). After this, Salman Khan in his quirky style joked that he has had enough and this is his last season. But further, he said that he can stick to the show if makers hike his fee unless he’s not stopping for another season. Bigg Boss without Salman Khan will surely face a hard hit in the TRP numbers.</p>
      <p>Salman Khan was labelled as a biased host by netizens, who came up with the #BiasedHostSalmanKhan hashtag to criticise him for supporting actor Sidharth Shukla and slamming Mahira Sharma in last week’s ‘Weekend ka Vaar’ episode of “Bigg Boss 13”.</p>
      <p>The whole week in the “Bigg Boss” house was about Sidharth getting aggressive and hurting Mahira during a task, for which he was nominated for two weeks punishment. Later, Paras Chhabra also claimed that he hurt his finger because of Sidharth. In the last Saturday’s episode, Salman cleared the whole situation, saying that Paras was responsible for his injury and not Sidharth.</p>
