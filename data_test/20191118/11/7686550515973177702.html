      <h1>Prominent Plaid Cymru activist suspended over anti-Semitic tweets</h1>
      <h2>Sahar Al-Faifi has apologised for the posts and admits they "crossed the boundary into anti-Semitism"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:53:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author">Ruth Mosalski</a></address>
      <p>A Plaid Cymru activist has apologised comments she admits "crossed the boundary into anti-Semitism" and has been suspended from the party.</p>
      <p>Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, appeared in Plaid Cymru's party political broadcast for the General Election. The video was shown on BBC Wales, ITV Wales and S4C on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Screenshots of tweets from 2014 were circulated on social media after it was shown and Plaid Cymru suspended her from the party.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/plaid-cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> spokesman said: "We have taken immediate action to suspend the person in question. We will investigate all allegations.</p>
      <p>"Plaid Cymru will not tolerate anti-Semitism, racism or intolerance in any form. That includes the appalling abuse the individual has been subject to. It is not a part of the Wales we want to build."</p>
      <p>Ms Al-Faifi is a regular commentator in the media on issues particularly involving gender and Islam.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Monday, she said: "Several years ago I made a handful of social media posts that I regret deeply as they crossed the boundary of criticism of Israel into anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>"I deleted the tweets more than five years ago, and issued an apology to Jewish organisations and others.</p>
      <p>"I have also undertaken anti-Semitism training, both formally through the Board of Deputies and informally with Jewish colleagues in order to ensure I never repeat the same mistakes.</p>
      <p>"I am committed to working for a Wales safe and open to all, and free from any kind of discrimination or abuse.</p>
      <p>"I would like to add that I have always been prepared to be open about my activities as an activist and campaigner, and I am willing to be held accountable for my past mistakes.</p>
      <p>"As someone who has faced much abuse, verbal and even physical, I know the importance of language and that the current political climate is one in which many minority groups - including Muslim women - face an impossible tidal wave of abuse, suspicion, and guilt, by simply being active in public life, all of which is most vitriolic online.</p>
      <p>"It is part of a pattern of Islamophobic behaviour that is regularly deployed against Muslim politicians, academics, journalists and others.</p>
      <p>"We must change our political culture if we wish to thrive as a democracy and work towards a Wales that is more inclusive, more welcoming and more just for everyone."</p>
      <p>After Plaid Cymru tweeted about its campaign with an image of Ms Al-Faifi, it said there were a number "Islamaphobic responses" and they issued a tweet in support of her on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"The abusive Islamophobic responses to our tweet are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. We stand with Sahar and all Muslim people in Wales and beyond. Wales is rich in its diversity. We are all Welsh citizens. We are all equal. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NiYwCymru">#NiYwCymru</a> ," it read.</p>
      <p>A Twitter thread by Abdul-Azim, who describes himself as an academic in religious studies and contemporary Islam, puts forward Ms Al-Faifi's response to the allegations.</p>
      <p>He says: "The social media posts in question are historic and have been deleted by Sahar. The screenshots being circulated today are not "current" but taken several years ago.</p>
      <p>"Sahar unreservedly apologised about the tweets to her Jewish colleagues and friends, and to several organisations, including the Board of Deputies.</p>
      <p>"Sahar willingly undertook anti-semitism training (through more than one source).</p>
      <p>"By and large, the issue was dealt with between the parties involved (Jewish friends and colleagues of Sahar, Jewish representative boards, and Sahar herself). It was, until today, largely concluded.</p>
      <p>"For her supporters, I hope this clarifies the screenshots being circulated and that your trust in Sahar isn't misplaced. Politics has always been ugly but recently it feels uglier, with no space for dialogue, and the weaponisation of "call out culture" for personal gain."</p>
