        <b>The Judiciary Police (PJ) announced that it had dismantled an organisation that was engaged in large-scale production of cannabis for export to several Central European countries and detained three foreign nationals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The investigation, conducted through the Northern Directorate of the PJ, began with the detection of an order shipped to Germany, and the subsequent detention of a person of foreign nationality and the identification of two production sites, PJ says.</p>
      <p>“In one of these locations, an industrial warehouse south of Porto, meanwhile abandoned by the organization, was seized with narcotics and relevant evidence and subsequent steps allowed the location and surveillance of a second industrial warehouse, also near Porto,” PJ said.</p>
      <p>In this second warehouse, according to police, “about 5,300 feet of cannabis sativa plants in different growing states were seized, divided into nine autonomous greenhouses, their heating systems, extraction air and ventilation in a highly sophisticated vacuum production and packaging process for later export.</p>
