      <h1>Pundit says LFC should buy Ibrahimovic as Origi isn’t good enough</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:13:47+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Former Scotland international turned pundit Craig Burley reckons Liverpool would be missing a trick by not offering fee agent Zlatan Ibrahimovic a short-term contract until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The Swede, undeniably one of the best players of his generation, is a free agent having left LA Galaxy recently – and Jurgen Klopp recently joked that he would snap the forward up if he hadn’t have previously played for Manchester United [<a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-urged-sign-zlatan-ibrahimovic-20905886">Star</a>].</p>
      <p>Burley though has slammed Divock Origi, our current first-choice backup to Roberto Firmino and suggested Ibra would do a better job.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“We laughed when we talked about if Jurgen Klopp had been asked about him,” Burley explained on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-nZDJ49P_M">ESPN FC</a> . “But this is something I genuinely believe can work short-term.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I know he doesn’t fit their style, with the pressing style and all that.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“But they have nobody else, literally nobody else, other than Roberto Firmino [in a central attacking role].</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Please don’t talk to me about Divock Origi, you’re talking about Liverpool trying to get over the line in the Premier League for the first time in 20-odd years. Sometimes you need something different.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“We’re talking about a guy who may only be coming off the bench now and again for 20 minutes or half an hour, and just bringing something different, that bit of quality.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Nobody is asking him to run around or close teams down in the first half of a game.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“But I think he can really offer something to a team like that for six months towards the end of the season. I don’t suggest it’ll happen, but it would work.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic is 38-years-old, and as Burley suggests, is not set out for the high intensity football Jurgen Klopp demands from all eleven Reds on the field.</p>
      <p>Origi has done well this term already and suits the role of impact sub, as his many important late goals prove.</p>
      <p>Ibra and his enormous ego could potentially damage our excellent squad harmony – especially considering the multiple outrageous statements he makes about how he’s better than his team-mates – something that wouldn’t fit well with Klopp’s humble group.</p>
      <p>It’s a fantasy idea, and not something we should or will seriously consider.</p>
