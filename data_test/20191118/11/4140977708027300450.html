                            <i>â€˜In the last three weeks I have been playing with limitations. â€˜Everyone knows that I donâ€™t like to be substituted, but there was no problem in my gestures after the change. I tried to help Juventus by playing injured.</i>

                            </p>
                            <p>Ronaldo admitted that he has been playing for Portugal while carrying an injury as well and still hasnâ€™t healed despite putting up a great performance in his 2 matches with the European Champions.</p>

Thankfully, I havenâ€™t been injured much in my career but it can happen. â€˜Itâ€™s a pain that prevents me from being 100%, but I always try to play. They created a big controversy where it didnâ€™t need to exist. Iâ€™ll be back to 100% soon.â€™</i>
