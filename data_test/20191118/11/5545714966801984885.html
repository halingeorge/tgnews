      <p>Nintendo's mobile-racer <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> is gearing up for the holiday season, with the latest reveal of a new Winter Tour, which will get underway tomorrow, November 19, at 22:00 PT.<br/><br/>The event was announced on Twitter by developer DeNO, advising racers to bust out their snow tires and chains for "a flurry of fun". The message was accompanied by a simple image of a snowman and a Christmas tree.<br/><br/>With regards to the new events unlockable items, we'll have to wait a little longer to find out what characters and skins will be filling <i>Mario Kart Tour's</i> reward pipe - which is like Santa's sliegh but with terrible odds you'll get a gift you want. We do know, at the very least, that <i>Mario Kart DS</i>' DK Pass circuit will be added to <i>MKT's</i> circulation of tracks.<br/><br/>And if there is a "Santa Suit Mario" variant, I'll eat my own weight in mince pies.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-17-brace-yourself-for-a-flurry-of-fun-as-mario-kart-tours-next-tour-gets-us-in-the-christmas-mood">Brace yourself for a 'Flurry of Fun' in Mario Kart Tour</a> [Eurogamer]</p>
