      <h2>Ford joins the electric crossover fray with the Mustang Mach E</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:02:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>An all-new stallion has just joined Ford's stable. It may called a Mustang, but for the first time it's a crossover. Not only that: it's powered by electricity.</p>
      <p>This is the Ford Mustang Mach E, a crossover aimed directly against the likes of the Tesla Model X, Mercedes-Benz EQC, and the Jaguar I-Pace. Ford says the Mustang Mach E combines sports car-like performance, clean zero emissions, and the practicality and spaciousness of a crossover.</p>
      <p>But is it still a Mustang?</p>

      <p>The Mach E name seems to stem from the original Mustang Mach 1 from the 70's, but it's taller, larger, and has two more doors (3 if you count the liftgate) than any Mustang before. </p>
      <p>The Mach E looks as if Ford took a regular Mustang and transformed it into a sleek crossover. The tapered headlights give this EV an unmistakable look while the front grill provides an imposing finish. But perhaps providing the most prominent design features for the Mustang Mach E are the signature three-bar taillights and the long hood and fastback profile that have become hallmarks of the pony car.</p>
      <p>Hop inside and the Mach E greets its occupants with two digital displays. The first screen makes its home on the driver's side. Meanwhile, a huge tablet-inspired 15.5-inch infotainment display provides in-car amenities, as well as managing the car's onboard settings.</p>

      <p>It offers wireless connectivity and comes with Ford's next-generation SYNC system. It even comes with intelligent voice control via Alexa. Other key features available include Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and a smart navigation system that can disply live traffic feed and available charging stations. Want more sunshine inside the Mach E? An optional panoramic glass roof is avaialable and it comes with infrared protection to keep the occupants safe from harmful UV rays.</p>

      <p>Besides having seating for five individuals, the Mach E takes advantage of space. With the batteries placed on the underside of the body, Ford was able to maximize cabin and luggage space. Moreover, it has a sizable 'frunk' which can hold about 135 liters worth of cargo, big enough to hold a cooler or small boxes.</p>

      <p>The driving force of the Mustang Mach E is, you guessed it, electric motors. Depending on the model chosen, the Mustang Mach E can produce between 255 PS with 415 Nm of torque on the rear-wheel drive versions, and 332 PS with 565 Nm of torque on the all-wheel drive variants. In addition, the Mustang Mach E will have a maximum range between 370 km to over 480 km (when equipped with extended battery). Opt for the top-of-the-line GT, and it can sprint from 0 – 97 km/h in as little 3.5 seconds thanks to a power rating of 459 PS and 830 Nm of torque.</p>

      <p>Recharging the Mach E's batteries can easily be done at the comfort of your own home. When using a 240 volt charging system, Ford claims the batteries can be charged at a rate of 50 km per charging hour. This allows owners to easily charge up the Mach E before going on a long roadtrip just a few hours prior. A mobile charging system comes as standard and can recharge the Mach E at a rate of 35 km per charging hour.</p>
