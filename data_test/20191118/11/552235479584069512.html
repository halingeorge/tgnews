      <p>Former Rangers footballer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/peter-lovenkrands-rangers-lesson-helping-20901416">Peter Lovenkrands</a> has won a battle to stop a new house being built next to his luxury mansion.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/peter-lovenkrands-rangers-lesson-helping-20901416">Danish</a> star complained that a proposed home near his five bedroom pad would ruin his privacy and make his school run more difficult.</p>
      <p>The retired player, now a reserve team coach at Rangers, lives in a £1.3 million property in the upmarket village of Thorntonhall, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/peter-lovenkrands-rangers-lesson-helping-20901416">Lanarkshire</a> .</p>
      <p>He objected to South Lanarkshire Council after businessman Thomas Swanson submitted plans for a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/peter-lovenkrands-rangers-lesson-helping-20901416">four bedroom house</a> on land next to his.</p>
      <p>The local authority has now refused to grant planning permission for the project.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/peter-lovenkrands-rangers-lesson-helping-20901416">Lovenkrands</a> , 39, who lives with his Scots wife Teresa and their two daughters, had raised concerns road closures caused by building work could affect the school run for his children.</p>
      <p>In a letter to planning chiefs, the couple said: "Our family home is directly in front of the new proposed house. This will mean it will look directly onto our living area and bedrooms and into the most used part of our home and a complete loss of our privacy.</p>
      <p>"The road outside our house is a very narrow one with two larger cars struggling to pass each other at best of times. How would this work with lorries and diggers?</p>
      <p>"We have two young children so building work and any affected road closures in such close proximity is a major concern given this is the only route we use for work and school every day.</p>
      <p>"Our privacy is very important to us and we feel very strongly that the proposed house will have a huge effect on that."</p>
      <p>Two other neighbours also objected to the proposed house.</p>
      <p>In a written decision, planning officials said: "Careful consideration of this proposal has been undertaken and although the site is located within an area designated for residential land use, it is considered that this development would be detrimental to the amenity of the surrounding area due to the mass and scale of the proposed dwelling and its over dominance with the adjacent existing dwellings to the north.</p>
      <p>"Furthermore, in order to achieve safe pedestrian linkage with the rest of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/peter-lovenkrands-rangers-lesson-helping-20901416">Thorntonhall</a> , a footpath along the site frontage would require to be constructed which would result in the removal of a mature hawthorn hedge and other shrubs/vegetation, together with regrading which is considered undesirable in amenity terms."</p>
      <p>A statement submitted to the council by Swanson's architects said the proposed dwelling had been "carefully designed in such a way that would not overlook any of the neighbouring properties".</p>
      <p>It added: "The proposed one and a half storey, four-bedroom dwelling which reflects the rural and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/peter-lovenkrands-rangers-lesson-helping-20901416">modern design</a> of the surrounding area aims to enhance the character of the area whilst being sympathetic to the surrounding adjacent buildings."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lovenkrands put his lavish family home ' which features a trendy games room with pool table - up for sale at offers over £1.2million in 2013 while playing down south for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/peter-lovenkrands-rangers-lesson-helping-20901416">Birmingham City</a> .</p>
      <p>However he later took the property off the market when he moved back to Scotland after retiring from the game.</p>
      <p>The property ' which is protected by security gates ' has a cinema, gym and spa.</p>
      <p>Lovenkrands, who had six seasons at Ibrox and also played for Newcastle United, paid £1.3million for the pad in January 2008.</p>
