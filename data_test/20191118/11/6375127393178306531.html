      <h3>SEVEN illegal recruiters who dupe applicants of their hard-earned money in exchange for alleged jobs as hotel or restaurant workers in Singapore only to end up as prostitutes were arrested by the Manila Police District’s Special Mayor’s Reaction Team (SMaRT).</h3>
      <p>SMART chief Maj. Jhun Ibay said the recruiters represent the APP Worldwide Recruitment Services which holds office in Malate, Manila. He said at least 20 applicants were been victimized by the suspects.</p>
      <p>Ibay identified the suspects as Ruben Samonte, general manager; Evelyn Samonte, marketing manager; Agnes Almoguera, clinic staff; Jocelyn Tolentino,  staff; Rolando Patiag, clinic staff; Chaz Patiag, marketing staff and Regino Tolentino, driver.</p>
      <p>The victims sought the help of Manila Mayor Isko Moreno and Ibay that they were offered jobs as waiters and waitress in a bar in Singapore. They said they paid thousands of pesos to cover various fees, including for training and medical exams.</p>
      <p>Ibay said that when the would-be employer in Singapore interviewed the applicants through a video call, it was made clear to them that they will not be able get paid if they don’t agree to have drinks and sex with customers.</p>
      <p>When the applicants refused, the recruitment company hid their passports and warned that they would be blacklisted so that no other agencies will employ them.</p>
      <p>An entrapment operation was setup Ibay’s group which resulted in the suspects’ arrest. The victims’ passports were recovered.</p>
      <p>Charges for violation of the Philippine Passport Act of 1996 (illegal withholding of passports), Presidential Decree No. 28 (illegal recruitment as a crime of economic sabotage), Article 286 ng Revised Penal Code (grave coercion) and Omnibus Revenue Code of the city of Manila were filed against the suspects.</p>
