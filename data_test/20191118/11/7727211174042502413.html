      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:51:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/emilia-bona/" target="_blank">Emilia Bona</a></address>
      <p>A man dropped dead at a Job Centre in South Wales after earlier being reportedly declared 'fit for work'.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old, who has not been identified, is believed to have been waiting for an appointment in Llanelli, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/man-drops-dead-job-centre-queue-declared-fit-work-11174319/">reports the Metro.</a></p>
      <p>He was found slumped in his chair at 9.30am on Llanelli while waiting for an appointment to discuss Jobseeker’s Allowance after reportedly being declared fit for work earlier this year.</p>
      <p>It is understood staff and customers rushed to try and help the man and tried to resuscitate him while an ambulance was called.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/man-drops-dead-job-centre-queue-declared-fit-work-11174319/">The Metro reports</a> that the job centre was evacuated and paramedics declared him dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>A witness told the Metro: "I didn't know him myself, but the man who was sat next to me told me that he had grown up with the guy.</p>
      <p>"The man next to me told me that the poorly guy had diabetes and had been declared fit for work by the Job Centre earlier in the year, but he was obviously ill.</p>
      <p>"The ambulance came, but he sadly died, and they had to take his body out of the Job Centre. It was awful."</p>
      <p>He added: "It was a horrible situation, that should have never happened. The Job Centre is all shut down now."</p>
      <p>An ambulance spokesman said: "We were called on Friday November 15 at approximately 9.33am to reports of a person needing urgent medical attention on Stepney Street in central Llanelli.</p>
      <p>"We responded with one rapid response vehicle, one specialised medical vehicle and one emergency ambulance."</p>
      <p>A DWP spokesman said: "Our thoughts and those of the staff at Llanelli Jobcentre are with the family and friends at this time."</p>
