        <li>The owner of a zoo in Crimea has put 30 bears up for adoption in an attempt to save them from euthanasia because he can’t afford to keep them.</li>
        <li>Oleg Zubkov – known as “Lion Man” – founded the <a href="http://park-taigan.ru/about-us">Taigan Lion Park</a> in the city of Simferopol in 2006 to house ex-circus and captivity animals.</li>
        <li>But opposition from local authorities and slumping ticket sales mean he can’t afford to feed the some 2,500 wild bears, lions, and tigers in his care.</li>
        <li>“Bears are just the first stage. Eventually, there will be a sale of the rest of my collection,” Zubkov said.</li>

      <p>The owner of a zoo in Russian-controlled Crimea has put up 30 bears for adoption, saying he can’t afford to feed them and will have to put them down if new homes can’t be found.</p>
      <p>Oleg Zubkov founded the <a href="http://park-taigan.ru/about-us">Taigan Lion Park</a> in the city of Simferopol in 2006 to house ex-circus and captivity animals, but has struggled to keep the park financially viable in recent years.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYCKs8Vu9N0">a video posted to his “Lion Man” YouTube channel</a> on Wednesday, Zubkov said his 2,500 lions, tigers, and bears consume 3,500 tonnes of food a day, and he couldn’t afford to feed them all for much longer.</p>

      <p>“Twelve lions and tigers will be moved to other zoos shortly, and a final decision will be made about … shooting 30 bears from the park,” he said, according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/17/private-zoo-owner-crimea-pleads-public-take-30-bears-wont-have/">a translation from The Daily Telegraph</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m forced into these extreme measures because there are no other options left.”</p>
      <p>The zoo has faced <a href="https://www.idausa.org/campaign/wild-animals-and-habitats/latest-news/stop-lion-and-tiger-deaths-and-disappearances-at-russian-zoo/">opposition from animal rights activists</a>, and Zubkov says he has been slapped with fines by Russian authorities since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p>
      <p>The lease for the land he rents to house his animals has not been renewed, Zubkov wrote <a href="http://olegzubkov.blogspot.com/">on his blog</a> on October 5.</p>
      <p>“I’m disgusted with this decision and I’m very sorry because I’ve been collecting and saving these species for a long time,” <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/11/15/crimean-zoo-owner-asks-public-to-take-30-bears-otherwise-hell-kill-them-a68185">he told The Moscow Times</a> on Friday.</p>

      <p>Zubkov said that he would put up his lions and tigers for adoption next: “Bears are just the first stage. Eventually, there will be a sale of the rest of my collection.”</p>
