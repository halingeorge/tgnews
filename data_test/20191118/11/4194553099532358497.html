      <h1>Online Roulette vs. Football Betting: Who Gives You Better Chances</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:49:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/tomsimmons/" target="_blank">Tom Simmons</a></address>
      <p>When it comes to winning cash by playing online games, players are eager to find out where they have better chances to earn more. The online casino and sports betting industries are on the rise. </p>
      <p>The ultimate question is whether you can earn more by playing online roulette or football betting. This is not an easy question to answer, especially since we know that some people prefer one over the other.</p>
      <p>One thing is certain, whether you choose to play online roulette or bet on football, you are going to take chances. For some, you take more chances by playing roulette, for others its the opposite. </p>
      <p>We decided to shine some light on this dilemma. Let’s see who gives your better chances online roulette or football betting.  </p>
      <h3>Online Casinos Are Here To Stay</h3>
      <p>Let’s get one thing straight right from the start. Online casinos are definitely here to stay. The online casino industry is flourishing year after year, and many of them include both casino games, online slots, and sports betting opportunities on their websites. </p>
      <p>With attractive bonuses, loyalty programs, and diverse choice of games, online casinos attract players of all demographics. The convenience of playing games around the clock, with no limitations when it comes to devices and location is definitely the perk that perfectly resonated with the player base.</p>
      <p>Whether you want to play <a href="https://www.megacasino.co.uk/games/roulette/">roulette online</a> or place a wager on a football game, you can do it from the comfort of your home and any device you have at your disposal. </p>
      <h3>Online Sports Betting Is Still Successful</h3>
      <p>The online sports betting industry is following the success of the online casino vertical. There are millions of people that enjoy watching sports, football in particular. Give these people an opportunity to wager online on their favorite teams, and you have a recipe for success.</p>
      <p>This is precisely what happened. Traditional sports betting is still a thing, but online sports betting is becoming more popular year after year. </p>
      <p>Online sports betting opportunities are many. Football, as one of the most popular sports, is covered by many sport betting sites, but there are other sports as well. Players can bet on games ranging from NBA to NFL. There are also various horse and dog racing betting opportunities to pursue.</p>
      <p>On top of that online sports betting, websites also offer plenty of different sports betting types. Whether you want to place a win bet, point spread, handicap, total/over-unders, proposition bet, futures/outrights, or parlays/accumulators, you’ll be able to do it online. </p>
      <h3>Where Do Players Win More?</h3>
      <p>Many players seek more information before engaging in online casino or sports betting games, which is perfectly fine. One of the most frequently asked questions is: “Where do I stand to win more?” </p>
      <p>When it comes to online roulette and sports betting, the number of cash players stand to win depends on different factors. </p>
      <p>Experts say that playing the roulette is all about luck. The game is built with a negative edge, meaning that there is no viable strategy to use to ensure a win. You place your wager on color, a number, or both and wait for the ball to settle in its final position. </p>
      <p>The amount of cash you stand to win depends on the size of your wager. But the game is still very popular and accessible on many online casinos, including <a href="https://www.ice36.co.uk/">ICE36 casino</a>.</p>
      <p>In sports betting, you can win big money if you add more games with lower odds of winning on your ticket. The amount you stand to win is your wager multiplied by all the odds on the paper. </p>
      <h3>Where Is The Skill Cap?</h3>
      <p>When it comes to roulette, the game doesn’t require any skill, knowledge, or experience to be able to play it. It’s a pure game of chance. Guess where the ball is going to land, and you are a roulette expert. </p>
      <p>Despite the fact that it’s such a simple game to play, it’s still fun and engaging to play it. The same applies to online slots, which are particularly attractive to the UK players, <a href="https://baltimorepostexaminer.com/why-are-online-slots-in-the-uk-such-a-magnet-to-players/2019/03/14">as shown on this site</a>.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, sports betting requires significantly more knowledge, and the skill-cap is very high. In fact, the more you know about sports, team strategies, roosters, and players, the better you will be equipped to guess the outcome of a game. </p>
      <p>Add to this a variety of sports betting types and the opportunity to combine them in a single wager, and you have a betting activity that requires not only skill but also experience.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Roulette comes with a built-in house advantage of ~5.26%, which means that you stand to lose at least 5.25% of your entire betting capital. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, football betting lets you decide which games to bet on and which betting types to combine. It is not a game that relies purely on chance and therefore gives you better chances to win.</p>
