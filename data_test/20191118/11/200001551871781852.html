      <p>Despite barely featuring for Juventus this season, Merih Demiral’s performances for Turkey in Euro 2020 qualifiers have been impressive.</p>
      <p>The Juventus defender helped his country to qualify for next summer’s tournament with his heroic display against Iceland last week and <a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/">Turkish newspaper Fanatik</a> report he’s a transfer target for Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Despite interest from Manchester United and Milan, Fanatik claim Arsenal are currently leading the race for the Turkish defender and are ready to offer €40m to Juventus to get the player.</p>
      <p>Last week there were reports the Gunners planned to watch the 21 year old against Iceland.</p>

      <p>Its reported Arsenal are looking to act quickly to sign the player as they are hoping to strengthen their squad in the new year.</p>
      <p>Juventus paid €18m to Sassoulo to sign Demiral in the summer but shortly after that the Turin club signed Matthijs de Ligt, which has limited the chances available.</p>
      <p>Under Maurizio Sarri, Demiral has made just one appearance for Juventus and he could leave the Serie A club to get more regular football ahead of Euro 2020.</p>
