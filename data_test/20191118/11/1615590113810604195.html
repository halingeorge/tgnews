      <p>Desert Bus for Hope has surpassed $6 million raised for charity Child's Play in the 13 years since it was first established.</p>
      <p>The latest fundraising effort took place over 162 hours, and raised a record-breaking $864,415.</p>
      <p>"The dedicated team of volunteers are humbled by the generosity of all of its viewers, guests, and donors," said the organisers.</p>
      <p>For comparison, last year's event raised $730,099 and saw the livestream last for 160 hours, and broke the $5 million lifetime barrier.</p>
      <p>Organised by Canadian comedy outfit LoadingReadyRun, the charity event centres around a live streamed marathon of the Desert Bus minigame from the unreleased Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors Sega CD game.</p>
