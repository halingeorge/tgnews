      <p>Former Everton director of football Steve Walsh has revealed that he warned <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> against signing <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/romelu-lukaku">Romelu Lukaku</a> for <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> back in 2017, labelling the Belgium international as a "big baby".</p>
      <h4>Walsh claims Lukaku and Paul Pogba prioritise themselves ahead of the team</h4>
      <p>Walsh, who spent time as Leicester City's scout during their incredible title-winning campaign in the 2015/16 season, worked under Mourinho during his first spell as Chelsea manager.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old later served as Everton's director of football when the Red Devils were monitoring Lukaku in 2017. The striker joined the Manchester giants for an initial Â£75 million that summer.</p>
      <p>Lukaku endured a mixed spell at Old Trafford, tallying 42 goals in 96 games for the club.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAthleticUK/status/1196345044317270016">The Athletic</a>, Walsh has revealed that he had warned Mourinho that Lukaku did not have the mentality to perform at a top European club before United signed him.</p>

      <p>He said,</p>
      <blockquote>"When Jose [Mourinho] signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, I remember saying to him, 'You have to be careful with Lukaku. He is a big baby, you know'.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"He said he could handle him. I don't think he really got Lukaku on-side mentally, which you have to do.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"That is the case with him and Paul Pogba. They aren't my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team. I wouldn't have touched them. Because they are good players doesn't mean you are going to get a good team out of it."</blockquote>
      <p>Lukaku has since moved to Inter Milan and has enjoyed an impressive start for the Serie A giants this season, netting nine goals in 15 appearances in all competitions for the club so far.</p>
