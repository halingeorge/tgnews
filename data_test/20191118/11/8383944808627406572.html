      <p>Pakistan on Monday carried out "successful" training launch of a ballistic missile, the army said, amid spiraling tensions with longtime rival India.<br/><br/>Surface-to-surface "Shaheen 1" — named after a falcon species, also symbol of country's air force — is capable of delivering "all types of warheads" at a range of up to 650 kilometers (403 miles), Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, a spokesman of Pakistani army, said on Twitter.<br/><br/>The military also issued a video of the training launch — the second one since August.<br/><br/>"Troops displayed a high standard of proficiency in handling and operating the potent weapon system, ensuring Pakistan's credible minimum deterrence," Ghafoor added.<br/><br/>The latest test marks the country's fourth missile test this year. Pakistan test fired surface-to-surface Ghaznavi, Shaheen-II ballistic missiles, and tactical ballistic missile Nasr in August, May and January respectively.<br/><br/>Already heightened tensions between Pakistan and India have further flared up following New Delhi's decision to strip the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir on Aug. 5, with security experts fearing a fresh arms race in South Asia.</p>
