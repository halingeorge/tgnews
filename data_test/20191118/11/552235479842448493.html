      <h1>Man who made £50 heartwarming Christmas advert has released new tear-jerker</h1>
      <h2>Philip Beastall first advert went viral last year and now he's released another emotional festive offering.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:16:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/</a></address>
      <p>A film-maker who made everyone cry last year after his heartwarming <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> advert went viral, has released another emotional short film for 2019.</p>
      <p>Philip Beastall created his first advert back in 2014 showing a young man counting down the days until <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> so he could listen to a message from his mum, who passed away years earlier.</p>
      <p>The heart-warming short-film was picked up last year and went viral with many saying John Lewis should hire him, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/remember-viral-50-christmas-2018-17270887">Manchester Evening News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Now the Gloucestershire corporate filmaker has created the 2019 offering - and it is just as powerful.</p>

      <p>Titled 'Made For You', Phil introduced his video on Twitter writing: "Christmas is a time for happiness, love and belonging.</p>
      <p>"I'm excited to share this year's Christmas film."</p>
      <p>The two-minute film depicts a long distance <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/love-and-romance">relationship</a> carried out between two guys who are only able to stay in touch via text and FaceTime.</p>
      <p>But fast forward to Christmas day and the couple are reunited and a romantic proposal takes place when they're finally reunited.</p>
      <p>Since going live on You Tube the clip has been viewed 15,000 times in just 24 hours.</p>
