      <p>"It was with deep dismay that the President of the Republic learned later this afternoon of the death in service of the GNR military, Corporal Jorge Gomes, and the wounding of another military man accompanying him on the scene in a signalling operation of a first accident," reads a message by Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa posted on the Presidency of the Republic's website.</p>
      <p>The Head of State stated that he was "sensitive to the relevance of GNR's road surveillance mission as a means of deterring risky behaviour and reducing road accidents" and "thanks the mission spirit of all elements of the National Transit Unit at this difficult time".</p>
      <p>In the same note, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa states that he will be "attentive to the recovery of the injured military man" and directs "the most heartfelt condolences to the GNR and the relatives of the military man who lost his life in the fulfilment of his mission".</p>
      <p>The car crash on the A42 in Arreigadas, Paços de Ferreira, in the Porto district, caused two deaths, one of which was a GNR military man, three seriously injured and one minor, said the source of the Porto District Relief Operations Command (CDOS).</p>
      <p>According to the same source, the car that crashed, crashed into a light vehicle and a trailer, and the deceased GNR military man was run over while assisting another accident a short time earlier at the scene.</p>
      <p>The other mortal victim is the driver of the crashed car.</p>
