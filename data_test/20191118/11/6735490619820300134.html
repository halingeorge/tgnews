      <p>“If I come in 9-to-5, do all my work, and shut off my phone, I can have a balanced life,” Hudson says. “I try not to let work spill into time with the kids, dinnertime, and in bed.”</p>
      <p>Hudson also reveals that she kept herself to a more strict diet than usual after having her third child last year.</p>
      <p>“Unlike with the other two, I didn’t really have time to work out,” she says. “It took a different kind of discipline. I feel good, energetic, and strong. I feel like myself again.”</p>

      <p>Part of that discipline is working out four times a week, she explains: “I love how flexible I get and what it does to the shape of my body. I know I’m at my strongest when I’m doing my Pilates.”</p>

      <p>Hudson also talks about the problems that arise when trying to be a “perfect” parent.</p>
      <p>“I make mistakes all the time. I’ve yelled at my kids too much, and I’ve also cursed in front of them, and I also haven’t shown up for things because I was out of town,” she admits. “But at the same time, I have days where I’m like, ‘I’m a f**king supermom.’ I am cooking, cleaning, doing homework, changing diapers, I worked out. What I’ve learned—and what I’m learning—is that I’m doing the best I can.”</p>

      <p>Through it all, self-care is very important to a balanced life.</p>
      <p>“I have so many kids. I do check out,” he says. “I go away with [them], usually to our ranch in Colorado. I sit and look out at the mountains. My doctor says I should be going away on my own, but I’ll do that when my kids are a little bit older.”</p>
