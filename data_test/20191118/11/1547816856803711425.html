        <b>That Karan Johar had a fixation for the letter K is well-known through his earlier films. Now, at the trailer launch of Good Newwz, the producer revealed how the 2 Ww's came into being for the title Good Newwz</b>

      <p>This morning, the <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/film-trailers/good-newwz-trailer-out-akshay-kumar-kareena-kapoor-khan-diljit-dosanjh-and-kiara-advani-s-ivf-chronicles-to-baby-bliss-are-a-winner/5dd232ed87fb571eff7e3ff2">much awaited trailer of Good Newwz</a> that stars Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani was launched in the city. We were a part of the launch event and we brought you all the updates right here. Here is one more.</p>
      <p>Producer Karan Johar revealed that his fascination for the letter K stuck around for several years as he gave us films like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kal Ho Naa Hoo and several others over the years. But with the passage of time, this superstitious belief vanished (the last being Kurbaan in 2008) and then we saw him back films like My Name Is Khan, Agneepath, Raazi, Simmba, and his last being Student of the Year 2.</p>

      <p>Added Karan, "Good Newwz director Raj Mehta has his own separate set of superstitious beliefs. Finally, I went ahead with his vision and that’s how the film is spelt as ‘Good Newwz’. Who knows, Raj might become our spell-man."</p>
      <p>Karan hopes the 2 Ww’s to work for the film, so let’s wait and watch. So far, the trailer looks quite interesting and it’s trending on number 1 since the time it was released on the Internet.</p>

      <p>At the event, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/good-newwz-trailer-launch-karan-johar-reveals-i-went-to-akshay-kumar-for-some-other-big-film-he-told-me-usko-side-mein-rakhte-hai-yeh-banaate-hai/5dd2517587fb571eff7e4024">KJo also revealed how he had gone to Akshay with the script of some other project</a>, instead of Good Newwz but during their discussion, Akshay seemed more keen on the concept of Good Newwz rather than the biggie and that’s how he came onboard.</p>
