      <h1>Huawei Mate X Sold Out Within Minutes of Its Chinese Launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>The foldable phone made its debut last week, and there's another batch on the way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/huawei-mate-x-release-15th-november/">November 15</a> saw the Mate X released into the wild at last, with a price tag of 16,999 yuan (£1,870) and it sold out in a matter of minutes – mirroring the Samsung Galaxy Fold's launch in Korea, which saw <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/samsung-galaxy-fold-sold-out-korea/">the handset sell out just as fast</a>, followed by an influx of resellers flogging the phone at increased prices.</p>
      <p>Eager beaver buyers don't have to wait too long before the next wave drops, as Huawei will be rolling out a second load of them this week on November 22. Perhaps anticipating potential issues with its wraparound display, the manufacturer is offering 50 per cent off screen-related repairs and replacements. The Galaxy Fold has had a slew of screen issues - <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/samsung-galaxy-fold-pixel-problem/">even as recently as September</a> - and with the Mate X's screen on the outside, it seems that it's just asking to be damaged.</p>
      <p>A UK release date hasn't been confirmed for the Mate X just yet, but if you're itching to fritter away two grand on a new concept phone, you can <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/foldable-showdown-samsung-galaxy-fold-vs-huawei-mate-x/">see how it holds up against the Galaxy Fold</a>, or <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/motorola-is-bringing-back-the-flip-phone-with-an-all-display-razr-device/">check out what the slightly cheaper Motorola Razr has in store</a>.
