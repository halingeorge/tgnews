      <p>A former royal commanding officer has called police officers to investigate Prince Andrew following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-defends-car-crash-interview-saying-spoke-honesty-humility-11173141/">his BBC interview with Emily Maitlis</a>.</p>
      <p>Dai Davies made his feelings clear that he believes the Duke Of York’s friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein should be looked into by law enforcers.</p>
      <p>Joining Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> via a live video link from North Wales, Dai began: ‘My thoughts are with the 35-40 victims who didn’t appear to be mentioned in this documentary, so that’s my first thought.</p>

      <p>‘The second thought is thatgt anyone who has material evidence should come forward and give it to the appropriate authorities. That’s also crucial.</p>
      <p>‘Prince Andrew, like everybody else, is entitled to the fact that he is innocent of anything until proof says otherwise, but I do feel, having read some of the testimonies, that there is a credible case of why he should be interviewed [by police].’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘And if that evidence points to any criminality, then it should be under caution. That’s all I’m saying.’</p>

      <p>Dai went on to say that although Emily did a ‘great job’ putting the Andrew through his paces, she isn’t a police officer.</p>
      <p>When discussing Andrew staying at Epstein’s house for four days – two years after the sex offender’s first conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution – Dai continued: ‘What else has he [Epstein] got on Prince Andrew, I wonder? All of this will come out, trust me.’</p>

      <p>In his questioning on Saturday, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/queen-elizabeth-looks-stony-faced-prince-andrew-stands-car-crash-interview-11172113/">Andrew was grilled on allegations that Virginia Roberts</a> – now named Virginia Giuffre –  was made to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The prince ‘categorically’ denied having sex with her, but admitted he did not regret his relationship with the disgraced financier as it gave him the opportunity to meet people and help prepare for his role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>Morning television has been dominated by Andrew’s interview, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/piers-morgan-slams-prince-andrew-telling-demonstrable-lies-damaging-bbc-interview-11173217/">Piers Morgan slamming the prince for telling ‘demonstrable lies’</a>.</p>
