      <p>The Victoria's Secret model is stripping down to her bikini.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/shanina-shaik/">Shanina Shaik</a> showed off her enviable fit and toned figure in a stunning new shot posted to Instagram over the weekend. The gorgeous model flashed some serious skin as she spent some time on the tropical Caribbean island of St Barts and posed for the camera in what appeared to be her hotel room as she sported nothing but a skimpy black bikini top.</p>
      <p>In the selfie posted on November 17, Shanina could be seen pursing her lips as she looked off to her right. The 28-year-old model had her signature long dark hair wavy and pulled away from her face as she tied it up into a high ponytail that draped over her left shoulder.</p>
      <p>The Australian beauty appeared to show off her dazzling natural beauty as she kept her makeup pretty minimal and natural to reveal her flawless glowy skin.</p>
      <p>Shanina snapped the photo of her top half that put her triangular black bikini on full display. The two-piece, which was taken from her fellow <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/victorias-secret/">Victoria’s Secret</a> model <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/devon-windsor/">Devon Windsor</a>‘s newly launched swimwear collection called Devon Windsor Swim, didn’t leave too much to the imagination.</p>
      <p>The dark two-piece featured a pretty plunging neckline with a thin string across her chest. As for the straps, the matching black strings had a fun knotted design across her shoulders.</p>

      <p>She accessorized her bikini look with a barely there chain necklace fastened around her neck and a simple black hair tie, though the bottom half of her two-piece wasn’t visible in the snap.</p>
      <p>In the caption, Shanina told fans that she was doing a little posing in her room while getting ready. She didn’t reveal exactly what she was getting ready for in the post, as <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5748408/devon-windsor-married/">The Inquisitr</a></i> previously reported, the star headed to the island to celebrate Devon’s wedding to Johnny “Dex” Barbara, which took place over the weekend.</p>

      <p>The stunning selfie gained more than 22,000 likes in the first nine hours since Shanina — who’s appeared in campaigns for Victoria’s Secret and walked the runway for huge fashion brands such as Oscar de la Renta and Tom Ford — shared it with her 2 million followers, many of whom also flocked to the comments section to share their thoughts.</p>
      <p>“So so gorgeous,” one comment read. Another person told the star, “Absolutely love your eyes!”</p>
      <p>A third commenter added, “Gorgeous hot girl,” while another wrote after seeing the model’s stunning new bikini selfie, “You are gorgeous.”</p>

      <p>Others posted fire and heart emoji in the comments section of the snap to show their appreciation for her selfie skills.</p>
      <p>However, Shanina’s no stranger when it comes to treating fans to a bikini photo.</p>
      <p>As <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5736533/shanina-shaik-two-million-followers-bikini/">The Inquisitr</a></i> shared earlier this month, the gorgeous model recently stripped down to her swimwear for another snap posted to the social media site. She rocked a blue crop-top bikini on a boat to celebrate hitting the impressive milestone of reaching 2 million followers on Instagram.</p>
