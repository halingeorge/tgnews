      <h1>Winshield-less McLaren Elva is even faster than the Senna</h1>
      <h2>Imagine hitting top speed in the 815 horsepower Elva</h2>

      <p>It’s hard to keep count on how many special edition models McLaren has released over the past few years. However, the British marque’s latest limited-run model – the Elva – could be one of their wildest supercars yet. How so? McLaren says the new Ultimate Series model is lighter and even faster than the Senna. More importantly, it doesn’t come with a windshield or windows as well.</p>

      <p>The vehicle itself pays homage to one of McLaren’s older models. Specifically, the name is derived from the McLaren-Elva M1A sports car of the 1960s. Remaining faithful to its spiritual predecessor, the new Elva also lacks formal windows or a windshield. Despite the lack of a windshield or windows, McLaren says the Elva has been homologated for every market. As such, a fixed windshield is available as an option in certain markets. This is also good news for owners who don’t want to collect debris and insects while driving around in their Elva.</p>

      <p>Despite the lack of a windshield, McLaren says it won’t be a problem for occupants. The British marque says the Elva features McLaren Active Air Management System which directs air away from the cabin. The occupants are then encapsulated in an “aerodynamic bubble of calm”. McLaren achieves this by channeling air from the nose and then shoots out in front and over the cabin.</p>

      <p>Powering the Elva is a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, which produces 815 horsepower and 800 Nm of torque. It is mated to a 7-speed seamless-shift transmission sending power to the rear wheels. The high-powered V8 is paired to McLaren’s lightest carbon body yet. Because of this, the Elva goes from 0 to 100 km/h in under 3 seconds, and from 0 to 200 km/h in 6.7 seconds, relatively faster than the Senna.</p>

      <p>As with all special edition McLaren models, the Elva will be built in limited numbers. Specifically, only 399 Elvas will be built globally, with or without windshields. Each model will have a starting price of USD 1.69 million (Php 85.54 million) before adding any personalized touches.</p>
      <p>Despite McLaren claiming you don’t need it, we highly recommend you buy a good helmet if you do plan on getting an Elva.</p>
