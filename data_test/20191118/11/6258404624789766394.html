      <p>In a galaxy far, far away, Samsung has switched on its lightsaber in a battle that pits good versus evil. Well, <i>not quite</i>... but Samsung has announced a new Star Wars Special Edition of its newly released <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/galaxy-note-10">Galaxy Note 10+</a> flagship smartphone, which will launch next month in select global markets.</p>
      <p>The smartphone is branded to coincide with the release of <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>, which hits theaters in the United States on December 20<sup>th</sup>, 2019. The <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/star-wars">Star Wars</a> Special Edition bundle comes in black with red accents; even the S-Pen is decked out in red, which is quite a nice touch in our not so humble opinion. Other details that set this Galaxy Note 10+ apart from "lesser" counterparts include First Order and Star Wars logos on the glass back.</p>
      <p>Other niceties included inside the commemorative box are an embossed leather case for the smartphone, Star Wars-themed Galaxy Buds, and special collector's metal badge. On the software front, Samsung is including Star Wars-themed sounds, wallpapers, and shutdown animations.</p>

      <p>If you set aside the Star Wars livery and Sith-inspired packaging, the Galaxy Note 10+ is unchanged from the standard models. That means that you'll find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC, 12GB RAM, a bodacious 6.8-inch AMOLED Infinity-O display (3040x1440), triple cameras on the rear, and a massive 4,300 mAh battery that supports Wireless PowerShare. Samsung, however, hasn’t mentioned how much storage will come with this particular Galaxy Note 10+ SKU.</p>
      <p>We <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-review?page=1">reviewed the smartphone back in August</a> and found it to an excellent all-around device with respect to system and camera performance. The Galaxy Note 10+ also got high marks for its design, fit/finish and S-Pen, which sets it apart from most flagship Android smartphones.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars Special Edition will be available starting December 10<sup>th</sup> from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and the Microsoft Store priced at $1,299.</p>
