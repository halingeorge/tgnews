      <h1>Lego's Announced Some of Freebies You Can Get For Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:00:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Lego is always the company we look at when Black Friday comes along, because when the sets cost hundreds of pounds any amount of money off is seriously welcome. Now with the big day less than two weeks away, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/page/black-friday-cyber-monday-toy-deals?icmp=LP-SHH-F-MT-bfcmte-1257">Lego has revealed</a> exactly what sort of stuff you can expect during the Black Friday season - because as ever there's more to Black Friday than the day itself.</p>
      <p>The first thing to note is that Lego is actually splitting up the shopping season. There's the "biggest ever" Black Friday sale that last from 28th November to 2nd December, the Pre-Black Friday sales from 25th to the 27th, and 'VIP Weekend' on 23rd and 24th. So just over a week of money saving discounts.</p>
      <p>VIP weekend is, naturally, exclusive to Lego VIPs, with 30 per cent off selected sets over the course of the weekend and double points on everything you buy. That makes it the perfect time to buy the big expensive sets, even if they don't have much of a discount. Anyone spending more than £120 will also get this year's exclusive Christmas set (<a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/lego-unveils-one-of-its-black-friday-2019-promo/">a miniature Lego tree</a>), and anyone spending over £200 gets t<a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/black-friday-lego-red-brick-free/">he previously-rumoured upscaled 2x4 Red Brick</a> (and stand). Those gifts stack too, so if you spend £200 you'll get both.</p>
      <p>Signing up for a VIP account is easy, and you can do it <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/vip/join?icmp=LP-SHH-F-VIP-bfcmte-1260">online right now. </a>Though if you do it in the Lego store you can get a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/page/lego-offers-promotions?icmp=SW-SHB-P-DI-olafst-1091">free blue brick keyring,</a></p>
      <p>The tree will be available to non-VIPs from 28th November to 2nd December, with the same minimum spend. 2nd December will also see Lego offer a free 'Brick Friday 2019' minifigure with purchases over £75. It'll be available from 8am on the day, and will no doubt sell out quite quickly.</p>
      <p>Plus anyone buying the new 1989 Batmobile between 29th November and 5th December will get a miniature version of the car free too.</p>
