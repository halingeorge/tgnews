      <p>“I’m going to give you an absolutely categorical assurance I will keep Sajid Javid as my chancellor,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s a great guy and i think he is doing a fantastic job and I’m proud to count him as a colleague.”</p>
      <p>Javid has formerly held the positions of home secretary and culture secretary under Theresa May and David Cameron respectively.</p>
      <p>Before entering politics he was a partner at Chase Manhattan Bank , before rising to become a board member of Deutsche Bank.</p>
      <p>The chancellor committed the Conservatives to cutting business tax today in an op ed for <i>City A.M.</i></p>
      <p>“Last week I set out plans to borrow responsibly through clear fiscal rules to ensure we have 21st century road and rail links, the best broadband and the greenest economy,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So we will offer businesses certainty, reduced costs, smart long-term investment and responsible economic management.”</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson also announced at the CBI conference that plans to cut corporation tax to 17 per cent had been shelved.</p>
      <p>He said the change had been made to free up funding for the Health Service.</p>

      <p>“Because the NHS is the nation’s priority and our priority and because we believe emphatically in fiscal prudence, I hope you don’t mind that I also announce today that we are postponing further cuts in corporation tax.</p>
      <p>“Before you storm the stage and protest, let me remind you that this saves £6bn we can put into the priorities of the British people.”</p>
