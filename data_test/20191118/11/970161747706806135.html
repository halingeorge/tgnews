      <p>The Apprentice’s Lord Alan Sugar told fired Venezuelan candidate Jemelin Artigas her ‘country was in a state’ in a new race row, it’s been claimed.</p>
      <p>Jemelin became the latest star eliminated from this year’s series last week, but reports state that before she was fired, Lord Sugar made the dig at her native country.</p>
      <p>In the boardroom, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361506/the-apprentice-lorg-sugar-race-row/">it’s reported by The Sun</a> that Lord Sugar told her: ‘No wonder your country is in a state – it’s because it’s full of people like you.’</p>
      <p>Currently, Venezuela is in an economic crisis, with power outages and water shortages affecting those that live there.</p>
      <p>…Then of course controversial candidate Lottie Lion (who’s had her own share of racist scandals since filming the show) had to chime in, and the whole thing exploded on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She wrote: ‘I’m so fed up with fake news. On The Apprentice, if you were fired, it’s because you were performing poorly, not the colour of your skin.’</p>
      <p>‘[Lord Sugar] did not make this comment. People who are desperate for money and sell “stories” are the lowest.’</p>

      <p>However, Jemelin then claimed that, actually, he did, and slammed Lottie for getting involved.</p>
      <p>She wrote back: ‘How dare you! Comment on something doesn’t even concern you. Attention seeking like you!</p>
      <p>‘He did make this comment and however I did not sell this story it did happened now you will get exposed for who you are! [sic].’</p>

      <p>This year’s Apprentice has seen its fair share of scandal which kicked off when it was revealed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/07/apprentice-candidate-lottie-lion-hits-back-racist-accusations-warning-rival-shut-gandhi-10874201/">Lottie had threatened to ‘f*** up’</a> fellow candidate Lubna Farhan and told her to ‘shut up, Gandhi’ in a string of vile messages.</p>
      <p>Across the weekend, Lubna accused Lottie of ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/apprentices-lubna-farhan-slams-lottie-lion-not-learning-racism-scandal-clash-twitter-11169680/">learning nothing’ from the scandal</a> when Lottie told her to ‘stop trying to stay relevant’ and Lubna accused her of faking a romance with Ryan-Mark Parsons for publicity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/apprentice-candidate-accuses-bosses-ignoring-racist-incident-im-still-waiting-outcome-10977137/">Fired hopeful Souleyman Bah also spoke out</a>, saying he too experienced similar comments during his brief stint on the show.</p>

      <p>The BBC later told Metro.co.uk: ‘While this happened on a private messenger service once filming had concluded, the BBC nevertheless still expects the candidates to behave appropriately.</p>
      <p>‘The production company have looked into the issue and reported back, Lottie has been informed that her comments were wholly unacceptable and is in no doubt about our view on this.’</p>
