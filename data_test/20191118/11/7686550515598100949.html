      <h1>Labour under pressure to investigate candidate Maria Carroll over anti-Semitism allegations</h1>
      <h2>First Minister Mark Drakeford says he is "concerned" about the reports</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:20:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Harries</a></address>
      <p>Labour is under pressure to launch a full investigation into a candidate in a Welsh constituency following allegations of anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Maria Carroll is the Labour candidate for the General Election in the Carmarthen East and Dinefwr seat next month.</p>
      <p>The Mail on Sunday reported that she set up and ran a Facebook group whose members included people who made alleged anti-Semitic comments online, and that she even advised fellow Labour members how to defend themselves if under investigation for such comments.</p>
      <p>The private group was reportedly called the "Labour Party Compliance: Suspensions Expulsions Rejections Co-Op".</p>
      <p>Labour <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50445656">told the BBC</a> it not going to launch a full investigation as Ms Carroll did not make anti-semitic comments herself.</p>
      <p>But the decision has been heavily criticised by the Labour Against Antisemitism campaign group, which worked with the Mail on Sunday on its story.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Fiona Sharpe said: "Ms Carroll, who was first reported by LAAS to Labour in 2017, was a core member of a secret Facebook group that dealt with some of the most horrendous anti-semitic content our researchers have ever witnessed.</p>
      <p>"She should have been auto-excluded, instead she will continue as a Labour parliamentary candidate for a party that is incapable of dealing with its seemingly perpetual anti-semitism crisis.</p>
      <p>"We call on senior figures within Welsh Labour, including First Minister Mark Drakeford, to demand that a full investigation be carried out immediately and urge Ms Carroll to step down ahead of the General Election on 12 December."</p>
      <p>According to the Mail on Sunday, one of those advised by the Facebook group - which can only be accessed by group members - was Alan Bull, a former Peterborough Council candidate, who withdrew from his candidacy in 2018 after admitting that he shared an article on Facebook three years previously which suggested that the Holocaust was a hoax.</p>
      <p>Maria Carroll said she was previously a part of the Facebook group but said “I never saw these horrific anti-Semitic social media posts”, and that if she had she would have “immediately condemned them and called them out”.</p>
      <p>Writing on Twitter after the allegations that appeared in the Mail on Sunday, she said: “I’ve been an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism in our Party, including calling out anti-Semitic abuse towards Luciana Berger and anti-Semitism denialism within our Party.</p>
      <p>"I’ve been blocked by anti-Semitic accounts as a result.”</p>
      <p>Speaking of the Facebook group, she said: “I joined that group when left-wing members were being suspended from the Labour Party en masse to stop them voting in the 2016 Labour leadership election, for incidents such as retweeting Caroline Lucas.</p>
      <p>“When I noticed the group begin to focus on anti-Semitism I left it.”</p>

      <p>The Welsh labour leader and First Minister, Mark Drakeford, has said that he is “concerned” after reading the allegations, and said the matters had been referred to the UK Labour Party.</p>
      <p>“I am of course concerned of reports on the actions taken by Maria Carroll,” said Mr Drakeford in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Welsh Labour acted immediately and referred these matters to the Governance and Legal Unit of the UK Labour Party for investigation.</p>
      <p>“I have consistently made it clear that anti-Semitism has no place in our party or in Wales.”</p>

      <p>Ms Carroll is still expected to stand in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr for the General Election on December 12, alongside Plaid Cymru’s Jonathan Edwards, the Tory party’s Havard Hughes and Peter Prosser of the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>However councillor Owen Griffiths, who represents Labour on the Vale of Glamorgan council, said: “Support for this candidate should be pulled and she should be expelled from the party,” adding that “a lot of Welsh Labour members are saying the same”.</p>
      <p>Defending herself on social media on Sunday, Ms Carroll said: “I am distraught by today’s article and the dishonest light it paints me in.</p>
      <p>“My dad fought in WW2 helping to liberate Auschwitz, and suffered mentally for the rest of his life.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always been aware of the devastating consequences of anti-Semitism and will always fight this evil.”</p>
      <p>Plaid Cymru candidate for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Jonathan Edwards, called on Labour to withdraw their support for Maria Carroll pending the result of an investigation.</p>
      <p>“Antisemitism is racism pure and simple.”</p>
      <p>“The Labour party should remove official support for their candidate in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr pending an investigation into these very serious allegations.”</p>
