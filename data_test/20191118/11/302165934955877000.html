      <p>KANO, Nov 18 — Gunmen riding camels and horses killed six people in a village in northeast Nigeria, a region beset by Islamist attacks, police said yesterday. </p>
      <p>“Armed bandits” launched a predawn attack on Thursday on Aljannaru, a village in Adamawa state, before encountering a local self-defence group, police spokesman Suleiman Nguroje said.</p>
      <p>They “clashed with some hunters, which led to the killing of six (people)”, Nguroje said. </p>
      <p>Bandit attacks in northern Nigeria have risen in recent years, targeting remote areas and livestock.</p>
      <p>Villages in southern Adamawa have also been repeatedly attacked by Boko Haram jihadists, leading to the rise of hunters and other self-defence groups to fight them.</p>
      <p>In 2014, hunters helped force out Boko Haram militants occupying parts of Adamawa, yet sporadic attacks by the group persist.</p>
      <p>In a separate incident in neighbouring Borno state, three Nigerian soldiers were killed on Sunday when their armoured vehicle was hit by a projectile fired by Boko Haram jihadists, army sources told AFP.</p>
      <p>Fighters attacked the convoy at a military post outside the town of Gwoza, near the border with Cameroon, the sources said.</p>
      <p>“We lost three soldiers in the attack” said an army officer speaking on condition of anonymity, adding soldiers were injured and an army vehicle destroyed. </p>
      <p>The decade-long jihadist conflict has spilt into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon. It has claimed 35,000 lives and displaced around two million in Nigeria alone. — AFP</p>
