        <b>Scotland's Health Secretary has said she has "a great deal of concerns" over the way Glasgow's health board has handled a scandal-hit hospital - and has not ruled out Government intervention.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking on Good Morning Scotland on Monday, Jeane Freeman said putting NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) in special measures is "always an option".</p>

      <p>Ms Freeman said she would be making a statement at Holyrood this week on the matter.</p>
      <p>Last used on a beleaguered NHS Tayside in 2018, special measures mean the Scottish Government takes a more direct role in the management of a chosen health board.</p>
      <p>NHSGGC has again come under fire after it emerged that police are investigating the death of a three-year-old boy at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in August 2017, the same month as 10-year-old Milly Main.</p>
      <p>Two wards at the Royal Hospital for Children - on the same campus as QEUH - were closed in September last year following concerns from Health Protection Scotland over incidents of water contamination.</p>

      <p>Milly's mother, Kimberly Darroch, said she is "100%" certain her daughter died due to infected water at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Ms Freeman said: "Later this week, I will make a statement on all of these matters and it is not appropriate for me to say this morning, before I make my statement to Parliament, what it is I'm going to do."</p>
      <p>Asked if the use of special measures is an option, Ms Freeman replied: "It's always an option. It's something that we've done before in other cases, so of course it's an option to look at how we escalate any board.</p>
      <p>"By escalation, that means that the Government takes a more interventionist role."</p>
      <p>The Health Secretary also said she had "concerns" about the handling of the deaths of Milly and the three-year-old boy, named by the Daily Record as Mason Djemat.</p>
      <p>She said: "I have a great deal of concern and I have made it really clear that it is unacceptable for this board or any board not to fully inform families.</p>

      <p>"A matter of weeks ago, when I met families whose children are in the haematology and oncology wards... following that, I made sure I put someone into that board to make sure families got the detailed answers from the board they are entitled to and required.</p>
      <p>"It's clear, by what I've done, that I take this very seriously indeed.</p>

      <p>"Families are entitled to know these matters and the board should act on them."</p>
      <p>Ahead of the appearance of Ms Freeman before the Health and Sport Committee at Holyrood on Tuesday, convener Lewis Macdonald has said members have "deep concerns" about the hospital.</p>
      <p>He said: "The issues at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and Edinburgh's new Sick Kids Hospital are of deep concern to our committee.</p>
      <p>"We want to ensure that the public inquiry into the various issues these health facilities have faced is progressing.</p>
      <p>"We also want to know what progress has been made in creating a new national body to oversee NHS building projects in future and that the issues regarding the disposal of clinical waste are being addressed.</p>
      <p>"It is absolutely vital that patients in Scotland have faith that all healthcare facilities in Scotland meet the most robust standards of safety and cleanliness and pose no threat to their health."</p>
