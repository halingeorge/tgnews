      <h1>US authorities demand extradition of Mike Lynch for '$11bn fraud'</h1>
      <h2>Former Autonomy boss faces 17 charges in the US</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:40:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">INQUIRER staff</a></address>
      <p><b>US AUTHORITIES </b>have formally requested the extradition of Autonomy founder and CEO Mike Lynch to face fraud charges.</p>
      <p>Officials at the US Department of Justice (DoJ) are understood to have filed the extradition request in September.</p>
      <p>In a hearing in the federal court in San Francisco, California last week, Judge Charles Breyer issued an order asking the State Department to present a timetable for extradition proceedings by 1 December 2019.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old technology entrepreneur faces 17 charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy, in the US over the sale of Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011. Lynch founded the company in 1996, and <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3073535/hps-leo-apotheker-admits-he-didnt-read-autonomys-accounts-before-acquisition">sold it to HP in 2011 for $11bn</a>.</p>
      <p>Just months later, HP wrote down Autonomy's value by $8.8bn, accusing the company's senior executives of manipulating their financial reports to make Autonomy appear more valuable than it actually was.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3073136/hpe-vs-mike-lynch-begins">Lynch rejected the allegations against him</a>, stressing that Hewlett-Packard was trying to "shift the blame" for its mismanagement of Autonomy, and for wildly overpaying for the company in the first place. </p>
      <p>He also argued that Deloitte, the auditor for Autonomy before HP's acquisition, had found no issues in the company's financial statements.</p>
      <p>Lynch, along with Autonomy's former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain, is also fighting a $5bn civil complaint brought by HP Enterprise in London's High Court. In May, a <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3075730/ex-autonomy-cfo-jailed">US jury sentenced Hussain to five years in jail</a> after finding him guilty of committing fraud.</p>
      <p>In June, former HP CEO Meg Whitman told London's High Court that the conduct of Mike Lynch was "completely unacceptable" during HP's acquisition of Autonomy. Whitman was a member of HP's board that approved the deal.</p>
      <p>In his statements to the London High Court in June, Lynch denied that he had misled investors, auditors, and Hewlett-Packard. He said that Whitman "could not cope with all the fires" at the company. </p>
      <p>He added that HP tried to make him a "scapegoat" after Whitman failed in her integration of Autonomy with HP.</p>
      <p>Lynch has also filed his own $150m lawsuit against HP for the damage that their claims have had on his reputation. µ</p>
