      <h3>JNU Protest</h3>
      <p>The protests have turned from Opposition to hostel rule changes to an all-out political and ideological slugfest. Demonstrations have taken a violent and ugly turn many times with administration meetings being disturbed and staff members harassed. The assistant dean of students was allegedly detained for nearly thirty hours, a soon-to-be-unveiled statue of Swami Vivekananda was desecrated with objectionable messages and varsity corridors along with the vice-chancellor's office were marked with derogatory remarks by suspected miscreants. JNU has already filed complaints with the Delhi police and investigations into the matter are underway.</p>
      <h3>Teachers urge students to end their protest</h3>
      <p>Amidst the ongoing protest by the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU), a section of teachers from the university urged students to end their protest and get back to academics. The students of the varsity have been protesting for over the past two weeks against the recently introduced hostel manual, which imposes a hiked hostel fee and other restrictions. The administration had also issued a circular urging them to join the academic work.  The teachers addressed a press conference and announced, an executive committee was chaired to discuss the issue and extend concession for the fees.</p>
