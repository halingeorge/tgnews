      <h1>Help MMDCEs to take bold decisions – DCE</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:51:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:51</time> by <a rel="author">Opesika Tetteh Puplampu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sege (GAR), Nov. 18, GNA – The Ada West District Chief Executive Mr. Adzoteye Lawer Akrofi has said the MMDCEs will be secured to take decisions without the fear of being sacked or suspended should they have the mandate of the electorate instead of appointment by the President. </p>
      <p>Speaking in a Townhall meeting on educating the public at Sege on the upcoming Referendum and District Level Elections slated for December 17, Mr Akrofi said, the election of MMDCEs would empower them to decide in consultation.</p>
      <p>He said with traditional and other stakeholders, the usage of the common funds to support the communities just like the MPs were doing with their common funds and would make it flexible for the MMDCEs in their term of office.</p>
      <p>He said, currently there was a lot of pressure on the MMDCEs and that they needed enough fund to run their districts.</p>
      <p>"We have only the district assembly's common fund, which is also given to us due to the amount of Internally Generated Funds (IGF) so it means that we the MMDCEs have little fund to attend to some of your problems as compared to the MPs and so we want you to help us to help the district and also secure our term of office," he appealed.</p>
      <p>Mr Akrofi appealed to the electorate turnout in their numbers to vote YES for the Referendum and Vote for one person for the District Assembly and Five persons for the Unit Level on the December 17 Elections.</p>
      <p>"We have 40,000 eligible voters and what we should do now is get 40 per cent of them to go out and vote.</p>
      <p>Also, 75 per cent of the 40 per cent should vote YES then we are there.So please when you go out, vote YES," He explained. </p>
