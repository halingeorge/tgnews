      <p>Greencoat Renewables have acquired Killala Community Wind Farm in County Mayo for €37.2m.</p>
      <p>Further proceeds will be payable once another turbine on the wind farm becomes operational.</p>
      <p>The additional Siemens 3.4MW turbine, which is currently under construction, will bring the windfarm capacity to 20.4MW and is expected to be completed by the end of next year.</p>
      <p>Project revenues are contracted under the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff 2 scheme, which provides a minimum guaranteed floor price for generated electricity until 2032.</p>
      <p>The acquisition of Killala Community Wind Farm is funded by Greencoat's €380m credit facility.</p>
      <p>Investment manager at Greencoat, Paul O'Donnell, said: "We are pleased to announce the acquisition of Killala, adding another high-quality wind asset with long-term contracted revenues.</p>
      <p>This is our first acquisition of a community windfarm and we are delighted that the local community will be sharing in the value created."</p>
