      <p>A petrol station’s forecourt roof has been torn down in an attempted ATM robbery in Co Down.</p>
      <p>Extensive damage was caused during the raid in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Ballynahinch">Ballynahinch</a> in the early hours of Monday.</p>
      <p>It is suspected the thieves used a digger in a bid to rip the cash machine from the wall of Carlisle’s filling station and convenience store in Belfast Road.</p>
      <p>The road was closed on Monday morning, causing major disruption to rush-hour traffic.</p>
      <p>The attack is the latest in a series of ATM raids in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Northern+Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> this year.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night, thieves tried but failed to steal a cash machine from Belfast City Hospital.</p>
      <p>Industry organisation Retail NI condemned the latest attacks.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Glyn Roberts said: “Words fail to describe my anger at this disgraceful attempted ATM robbery on one of our members.</p>
      <p>“This has caused extensive damage to one of Ballynahinch’s largest retailers in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>“This is an independent retailer, who provides an invaluable service to the local community, awakened from his sleep to be told his business is smashed up.</p>
      <p>“It is also a new low for these robbers to attack health centres to steal ATMs.</p>
      <p>“We would urge all businesses and organisations who have external ATMs to be vigilant and urge members of the public with any information to contact the PSNI.” – PA</p>
