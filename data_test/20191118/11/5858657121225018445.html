      <p>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Princess Norodom Buppha Devi, eldest daughter of Cambodia’s late King Norodom Sihanouk, has died at age 76.</p>
      <p>Buppha Devi was the half sister of the country’s current king, Norodom Sihamoni, but was best known as a practitioner and promoter of classical Cambodian dance.</p>
      <p>Cambodia’s constitutional Council, of which she was a member, announced she died Monday at a hospital in Thailand. The cause of death was not given.</p>
      <p>Buppha Devi learned dance as a small child and became lead dancer in the royal troupe before age 18.</p>
      <p>She escaped from Cambodia before the 1975 Khmer Rouge takeover, returning to the country in 1991 with her father.</p>
      <p>She served as culture minister in 1999-2004, and as recently as 2018 was directing classical dance troupes on performances abroad.</p>
