      <p>BELGRADE -- Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has checked out of a hospital where he had been admitted after experiencing heart problems, the public TV broadcaster reports.<br/><br/>Vucic's health was "stable" and he was "released home," RTS reported on November 18.<br/><br/>His office has said that the president had been hospitalized at a military hospital in Belgrade on November 15 for "cardiovascular problems."<br/><br/>"Doctors saved his life on Friday," Health Minister Zlatibor Loncar told local media on November 17. "On admittance, it was estimated that his life was threatened."<br/><br/>Officials and pro-government media say Vucic's condition worsened following “inappropriate” questions by journalists about alleged corruption by government ministers.<br/><br/>Suzana Vasilljevic, Vucic`s media adviser, and Goran Vesic, the deputy mayor of Belgrade, among others officials, alleged "journalists [had] pressured the president too much” with questions on a murky arms deal between Serbia and Saudi Arabia on which a Serbian whistle-blower had reported.<br/><br/>The 49-year-old president has said he would return to work on November 18.<br/><br/>It was the first time it has been officially disclosed that Vucic suffered from heart problems.<br/><br/>The Balkan country maintains strong political and economic relations with Russia despite a proclaimed goal of joining the European Union.<br/><br/>Vucic has been Serbia's president since 2017. He has faced accusations of curbing media freedoms and democracy.<br/><br/>Under the president's watch, according to France-based Reporters without Borders, "Serbia has become a place where practicing journalism is neither safe nor supported by the state."</p>
