      <p>HP Inc. says its board has rejected a roughly $33.5 billion takeover offer from Xerox.</p>
      <p>The Palo Alto, California-based company said Sunday that the cash and stock deal undervalues its business and its board cited concerns about “outsized” debt levels should the companies combine.</p>
      <p>HP, which makes computers and printers, said it recognizes the potential benefits of consolidation and remains open to exploring other options to combine with Xerox Holdings Corp.</p>
      <p>Both companies have faced difficulties as the demand for printed documents and ink have waned.</p>
      <p>Xerox <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/xerox-considers-making-27b-offer-to-buy-hp-reports/">offered earlier this month</a> to give HP shareholders $17 in cash and a fractional share of Xerox stock for each share they held in HP. They put the total value of the deal at $33.5 billion. If the deal had been completed, HP shareholders would own approximately 48% of the combined company.</p>
