      <h3>10. Driving down Central Drive</h3>
      <p>It's forever double parked, no one knows who has priority and everyone speeds.</p>
      <p>Good luck parking outside your own home if you live down there.</p>

      <p>Are you even human if you don't jump every time a train zooms under them?</p>
      <h3>12. Jubillee Park aka Jubo</h3>
      <p>Friday night after school it was the place to be.</p>

      <p>This was for the older kids to hang around on - don't tell the year sevens.</p>
      <h3>14. Coseley Swimming Baths</h3>
      <p>Going there every day in the six weeks holidays was the highlight of our childhoods.</p>
      <p>Not forgetting the yellow slide, which was pretty much always closed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>15. The Coseley school was the best!</h3>
      <p>That was until it closed...</p>

      <p>Everyone gets their late night booze stash from there.</p>
