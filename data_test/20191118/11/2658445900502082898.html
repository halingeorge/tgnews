      <p>Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Monday congratulated the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidates on their victory in the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states.</p>
      <p>Lawan in a statement by Special Adviser (Media), Ola Awoniyi, particularly rejoiced with the Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello on his re-election and David Lyon for making history as the first governor Bayelsa has elected on a platform different from the outgoing ruling party in the state.</p>
      <p>He lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for ensuring a level playing field that enabled the people to assert their sovereignty and choose their leaders.</p>
      <p>“The impressive turnout of voters in the two states is a ringing endorsement of democracy by Nigerians as their preferred system,  notwithstanding its current challenges,” Lawan said.</p>

      <p>Lawan also thanked the security personnel for their sacrifices for peace and order in the face of great difficulties.</p>
      <p>The Senate President enjoined the winners to be magnanimous in victory by accommodating all sections of the state in their governments and development agenda.</p>
      <p>Lawan also admonished the electoral umpire to learn from the challenges experienced in the two states with a view to constantly improving its institutional performance and the electoral process.</p>
      <p>The Senate President called on the relevant agencies to ensure thorough prosecution of the electoral offenders in the two states to serve as a deterrence to others.</p>
