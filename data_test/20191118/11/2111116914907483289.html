      <h3>Could AMD reveal next-gen ‘Nvidia killer’ graphics card at CES?</h3>

      <p>AMD will take the wraps off its next-gen RDNA 2 Radeon GPUs at CES in not much more than a month’s time, likely revealing the much awaited high-end Navi graphics card, at least according to the rumor mill.</p>
      <p>Naturally, this is highly speculative, but on the other hand, the source uncovered by Wccftech is a reputable leaker (over at the Chiphell forums) who previously revealed correct info about the initial launch of Navi.</p>

        <li>These are all the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458">best graphics cards</a> of 2019</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the enigmatically named Wjm47196, CES will be the stage on which AMD will unveil its first preview of the next-gen Radeon graphics cards which will be 2nd-gen RDNA – a further honed and refined architecture compared to the original Navi GPUs, in other words 7nm+ – as previous rumors have indicated.</p>
      <p>And it’s likely that these GPUs will boast hardware acceleration to give games with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-hints-at-ray-tracing-in-the-future">ray tracing</a> faster frame rates, and to catch up with Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards on this front.</p>
      <p>This ties in with previous chatter from the graphics grapevine going back to August, when we first heard from another source that the high-end ‘Nvidia killer’ GPU (dubbed Navi 23 at the time) <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-navi-23-could-be-an-nvidia-killer-graphics-card-that-launches-in-2020">would likely be based on RDNA 2 architecture</a>. And that this graphics card is expected to debut in mid-2020 – it’s potentially the RX 5900, which could be launched alongside an RX 5800, going by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amds-navi-22-and-navi-23-gpus-recently-spotted-in-linux-driver">info recently obtained from Linux drivers</a> – so a start of the year reveal would pretty much fit with all this.</p>
      <p>We’ve also <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-rdna-2-graphics-cards-may-be-out-in-2020-according-to-leaked-roadmap">witnessed leaked roadmaps</a> showing that RDNA 2 Radeon GPUs are in development, and all this ties in with the possibility of the next-gen consoles possibly getting RDNA 2-powered graphics solutions – remember that those consoles have AMD chips and will support ray tracing, we know that for a fact.</p>
      <p>And most recently, don’t forget the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/has-amds-new-high-end-navi-gpu-for-ps5-and-xbox-scarlett-just-been-leaked">RRA certification leak which drove considerable speculation</a> about how this could relate to the rumored high-end Navi graphics card, and again this could indicate a launch coming sooner rather than later. Although note that all this should be taken with a considerable degree of caution – but that said, these rumors are starting to seriously mount up now…</p>
      <h4>Memory matters</h4>
      <p>With this latest revelation, Wccftech also chucks in its own speculation about the new high-end Navi card using HBM2E video memory rather than GDDR6, but we’d take that with a particularly sizeable chunk of salt. Still, who knows – it’s possible that the new high-end king could take the baton from AMD’s Radeon VII in this respect.</p>
      <p>This latest round of spillage is definitely one of the more interesting AMD GPU rumors we’ve heard in recent times, although we have to bear something else in mind: that a ‘preview’ of these new Navi graphics cards at CES could be something very minor, such as a slight tease rather than a fuller reveal. We might not learn anything about the cards, in other words, save for their existence…</p>
      <p>Finally, it’s worth noting that the source of this leak spilled a couple of other nuggets of info as well, including that there will allegedly be a new wallet-friendly Navi 10 desktop GPU also coming to sit under the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-5700">RX 5700</a> somewhere.</p>
      <p>It could be pitched around the $250 mark (around £190, AU$370) to take on Nvidia’s new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-super">GTX 1660 Super</a>, but we’re really getting into the territory of complete guesswork now. The indication is, though, that there will be another budget-minded GPU coming from AMD.</p>
      <p>Definitely not wallet-friendly workstation-class graphics cards will also be arriving with a new product line – which is no surprise – to be released ‘later’ down the line, the source claims, too.</p>
