      <blockquote>Gill, a master of both pyrokinesis and cryokinesis, is able to control fire and ice with perfect elemental balance (hence his outward appearance). Typically plotting behind the scenes, he is now ready to reveal himself to the world, as he sets out to fulfill the prophecy that the Secret Society has coveted since ancient times. Gill brings his “Retribution” to SFV Champion Edition in December 2019.</blockquote>
      <p>Street Fighter V Champion Edition launches at retails in February. The upgrade pack is available for purchase right now on PC and PlayStation 4.</p>
