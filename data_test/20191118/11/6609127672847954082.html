      <p>Sharing before and after photos to Facebook group to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExtremeHacks/?ref=nf_target&amp;fref=nf">Extreme<br/>Budget DIY &amp; Life Hacks</a>, she revealed her handiwork for her pet Labrador.</p>
      <p>She captioned the post: “Wasn’t using my under stairs cupboard so made my Labrador a bedroom.”</p>
      <p>The woman had turned an empty white space into a den for her four-legged friend, adding in a dog bed, food bowls, as well as adding marble and tile-effect walls and floors.</p>
      <p>She put up a shelf for his doggy treats, and even hung bunting with his name outside and a snap of her pooch in a bone-shaped frame.</p>
