      <p>New gameplay mechanics have been revealed today for Dragon Ball Z Kakarot, mechanics that will be able to provide players with new challenges.</p>
      <p>The latest issue of <a href="http://ryokutya2089.com/archives/25988">V-Jump magazine</a> revealed that the game will allow players to gather the Dragon Balls. Once all have been gathered, players will be able to make a wish to fight a defeated enemy. This mechanic will allow players to take part in duels that do not happen in the original story, as well as get additional experience and other rewards.</p>

      <p>The magazine also confirmed that enemies more powerful than usual will be found in the field. These enemies will provide a lot of experience points as well as other rewards once defeated.</p>
      <p>DBZ Kakarot is setting out to be one of the best DBZ games ever released. I had the chance to try out the game at the E3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-hands-on-preview/">earlier this year</a>, and I have been pleasantly surprised by the game. It will not break any new ground, but it will be an enjoyable experience nonetheless.</p>
      <blockquote>I wasn't expecting much of Dragon Ball Z Kakarot, but the E3 2019 demo definitely left me impressed. It can get a big mashy in battle, and some exploration mechanics could use a little tweaking, but there's no denying that any Dragon Ball Z fan will enjoy Dragon Ball Z Kakarot, as the presentation is top-notch and the gameplay fun, albeit not particularly original.</blockquote>
      <p>Dragon Ball Z Kakarot releases on January 17th, 2020 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One worldwide.</p>
