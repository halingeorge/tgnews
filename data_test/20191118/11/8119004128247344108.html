      <p>Abrar, a second-year student of electrical and electronic engineering, was bludgeoned to death by leaders and activists of BCL in his dormitory on Oct 6 after he criticised the government over a water-sharing deal with India on Facebook.</p>
      <p>His father started a case against 19 students with the police the next day. Police subsequently arrested 21 people over the matter. A total of 25 people, including the 21 arrested, were charged in the final charge-sheet.</p>
