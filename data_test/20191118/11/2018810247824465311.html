      <p>Custom controller pioneer <a href="https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1196144148543238144">Rudeism </a>is back with a <i>very</i> nice setup for <i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, which involves a lightsaber, a glove and what looks like some very gratifying force powers.</p>
      <p>The lightsaber is just a plastic toy version with motion sensors in it, while the glove also has motion sensors, with thumbsticks and buttons for movement and actions spread across both.</p>
      <p>As you’d expect/hope, you swing the toy lightsaber to swing the in-game weapon, and you push your hand around to activate Cal’s force powers:</p>
