      <p>A SOUTHEAST Asia regional conference for female law enforcement officials started rolling at the Novotel in Araneta Center yesterday aimed at recognizing the major role being played by policewomen in the region and at the same time fully promoting women empowerment.</p>
      <p>The forum dubbed “Women Leading in Law Enforcement in Southeast Asia” was participated in by around 200 female law enforcers from different Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines. The conference was jointly hosted by the Philippine National Police, the Quezon City Government  and the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INLEA) of the United States Embassy in Manila.</p>
      <p>The first-ever in Asia, INLEA Director Brandon A. Hudspeth said the conference aims to develop practical skills that will allow female police officers to strategically address unique challenges facing women in law enforcement.</p>
      <p>PNP Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa expressed full support to the regional conference saying it will advance women empowerment in promoting public safety and security services at all levels of law enforcement units and offices in the region.</p>
      <p>“The PNP leadership follows the national policy on Gender and Development and remains responsive to perennial gender issues and concerns,” the official said.</p>
      <p>As of last August 31, the PNP has a total strength of 186,922 uniformed personnel, of which 34,602 are females consisting of 2,473 Police Commissioned Officers and 32, 129 Police Non-Commissioned Officers.</p>
