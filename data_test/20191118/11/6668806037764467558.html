      <p>2019 has been all about unconventional comedies. After films like Dream Girl and Bala, Bollywood is all set for another comic relief this Christmas. Good Newwz, starring Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani is ready for a theatrical release on December 27 and the trailer to this multi-starrer just went live.</p>

      <p>The premise of the film is a goof-up that pregnancy nightmares are made of. Mrs. and Mr. Batra (Kareena and Akshay) are having troubles in conceiving a child and opt for IVF. The couple accidentally bumps into Kiara and Diljit, who are also Mrs And Mr Batra and you see where this is going. After a sperm mix-up, the lovely ladies end up getting pregnant. But that’s not the end of it, the comedy of errors starts when the couples try to cope up with the mix-up. Diljit and Kiara are hell-bent on being a part of Kareena and Akshay’s pregnancy while they totally don’t need the loud couple to be part of their lives. Their chalk and cheese personalities, mixed with this massive mix-up, make for a great watch.</p>

      <p>Good Newwz seems like a film we all will definitely watch during the upcoming festive season. It’s fresh, fun and its star power is sure to attract the audience in big numbers. Akshay and Diljit’s impeccable comic timing, mixed with Kareena’s histrionics and apt looks and finally Kiara’s brand new avatar as an extrovert Sardarni, all of this is sure to get a thumbs-up from the audience.</p>
