      <p>House Democrats privately believe that the impeachment inquiry could wind up with two or three articles of alleged offenses leveled against <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a></b>. But making a persuasive case grave enough to argue for the removal of a president less than a year before an election requires credible eyewitnesses willing to allege that Trump knowingly violated his oath of office.</p>
      <p>That’s why lawmakers in both parties eye <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a></b>, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who talked to Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senior-national-security-official-feared-leaks-of-trumps-call-to-ukrainian-leader-could-be-damaging/2019/11/16/3e88d768-08b9-11ea-8ac0-0810ed197c7e_story.html">half a dozen times during a key period in the summer and early fall</a>, as a potential tipping point when he testifies publicly on Wednesday. </p>
      <p>Sondland, 62, is a businessman, major Trump donor and inexperienced diplomat who testified last month to House impeachment investigators. He subsequently revised his deposition to concede he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. military aid would likely not be delivered until Ukraine agreed to make a “public anti-corruption statement” that witnesses said Trump imagined could politically harm former Vice President <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a></b> (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/read-gordon-sondlands-revised-testimony-about-trump-pressuring-ukraine.html">CNBC</a>).</p>
      <p>Two other senior officials — former national security adviser <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-bolton">John Bolton</a></b> and acting White House chief of staff <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/mick-mulvaney">Mick Mulvaney</a></b> — who have <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/470803-official-testifies-that-bolton-had-one-on-one-meeting-with-trump-over-ukraine">direct knowledge</a> of Trump’s actions and instructions tied to nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine and Trump’s desire to investigate Biden, his political rival, could implicate or defend the president. But sworn testimony from either or both men is <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/469595-mulvaney-defies-house-subpoena-cites-absolute-immunity-one-minute">up in the air</a> during what has become a subpoena-laden, fast-moving House process.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/16/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The New York Times</a>: Bolton and Trump met privately over withheld military aid.</p>
      <p>It’s not too soon for senators to prepare to receive one or more articles of impeachment from the House.<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/470746-impeachment-hearings-dont-move-needle-with-senate-gop?rnd=1573861409"> Alexander Bolton reports</a> that Senate Republicans have assessed the first week of public testimony and decided it did no damage to Trump or the party.  But that doesn’t mean there’s a consensus among rank-and-file GOP senators about how best to proceed as jurors, if or when the House turns the matter over to the upper chamber, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/470733-gop-divided-over-impeachment-trial-strategy">Jordain Carney finds</a>. </p>
      <p>On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee heard <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470798-budget-official-says-he-didnt-know-why-military-aid-was-delayed">closed-door testimony</a> from Office of Management and Budget career official <b>Mark Sandy</b>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-budget-official-with-knowledge-of-delay-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-to-testify/2019/11/15/f84b809e-07ef-11ea-924a-28d87132c7ec_story.html">who described the freeze on aid to Ukraine as unusual</a>. The committee also released transcripts from earlier testimony <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/470793-read-top-nsc-aide-tim-morrisons-closed-door-impeachment-inquiry-testimony">provided by</a> <b>Tim Morrison</b>, a former top National Security Council aide, and <b>Jennifer Williams</b>, a career foreign service officer and adviser to <b>Vice President Pence</b>. Williams was among the officials who listened to Trump’s phone conversation on July 25 with Ukrainian President <b>Volodymyr Zelensky</b>. She told lawmakers Trump’s remarks were “unusual and inappropriate,” according to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470834-top-pence-aide-told-lawmakers-trumps-ukraine-call-was-inappropriate">a transcript </a>released on Saturday.</p>
      <p>On Sunday afternoon, Trump attacked Williams on Twitter, calling her a “Never Trumper” while also saying he did not know her (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470852-trump-says-pence-aid-who-called-ukraine-call-inappropriate-should">The Hill</a>).</p>

        <u>LEADING THE DAY</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>POLITICS &amp; CAMPAIGNS: </b>Less than three months away from first-in-the-nation caucuses, South Bend, Ind., Mayor <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a></b> is the big surprise on the leaderboard in Iowa. He’s poised to be targeted by Democratic rivals as well as Republicans who are spending big money to try to shape next year’s presidential race.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, Buttigieg “rocketed to the top” of the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll (<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2019/11/17/pete-buttigieg-leads-new-iowa-poll-warren-sanders-biden-follow/4198100002/">Des Moines Register</a>), prompting a swirl of fascination, fresh punditry and analysis of the 2020 Democratic electorate.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Massachusetts’ Gov. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/deval-patrick">Deval Patrick</a></b>’s eleventh-hour decision to jump into the Democratic presidential primary — and a looming entrance from billionaire <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a></b> — rankles progressives and rank-and-file Democrats, who say that any such latecomers highlight a major disconnect between party elites and the political grassroots (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/470701-growing-2020-field-underscores-democratic-divide">The Hill</a>).</p>

      <p><b>&gt;</b> In the Trump-Pence reelection effort, a fringe group of far-right activists have been disrupting conservative and pro-Trump events, drawing rebukes from mainstream Republicans who want to distance the party from white nationalists and alt-right racists,<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/470687-conservatives-seek-to-stifle-new-alt-right-movement-seeped-in-anti-semitism"> Jonathan Easley reports</a>.

        <u>IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>MORE IN CONGRESS: </b>Beyond impeachment hearings and Senate confirmations, Congress has other pressing issues ahead, including keeping the government funded beyond a shutdown deadline of Dec. 20. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/470735-lawmakers-skeptical-of-progress-on-spending-deal-as-wall-battle-looms">Niv Elis reports</a> that rank-and-file members of both parties are skeptical they’ll make that deadline. Yet another stopgap measure that extends into February has emerged in conversations on Capitol Hill.  </p>
      <p><b>&gt;</b> Is impeachment an impediment to the <b>annual defense policy bill</b> or is the stumbling block over a wall being built at the U.S.-Mexico border? That blame game is alive and unresolved among senators (<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/470710-impeachment-battle-looms-over-must-pass-defense-bill?rnd=1573856137">The Hill</a>).</p>
      <p><b>&gt;</b> Advocates believe a consumer-focused <b>anti-robo call measure </b>supported by both parties may move to the president’s desk this year. Legislative details have yet to be released, but lawmakers say the conference bill will require phone companies to verify that phone numbers are real and to block calls for free. It will also give government agencies more authority to go after scammers (<a href="https://apnews.com/8cb3db123bb54883882906675c38bafa">The Associated Press</a>). </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p><b>WHITE HOUSE &amp; ADMINISTRATION: </b>Here are some other executive branch headlines that will get attention this week:</p>
      <p><b>Fitness and health</b>: What medical tests did Trump’s doctors perform on a Saturday afternoon at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and why? Any patient visiting a top medical facility for routine medical tests would be asked to fast after midnight and show up in the morning. But Trump’s late-afternoon “quick exam and labs” were unscheduled. He was seen by journalists who traveled with the presidential motorcade departing the hospital with his shirt collar unbuttoned and his tie off. His last known medical workup was in February.</p>
      <p>The White House said the president, 73, is healthy and energetic and used his “down day” to begin elements of his annual routine physical examination. No medical professionals briefed the news media immediately afterward, as has been customary following previous health exams for Trump as well as his predecessors (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/politics/trump-annual-physical-walter-reed/index.html">CNN</a>).</p>

      <p><b>Cinema, arts and an honor</b>: The president will award the National Medal of Arts to actor <b>Jon Voight</b> — a conservative supporter who has called Trump the “greatest president since Abraham Lincoln” — on Thursday at the White House. The medal honors Voight’s "exceptional capacity as an actor to portray deeply complex characters," according to a statement (<a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/470864-trump-to-award-national-medal-of-arts-to-actor-jon-voight">The Hill</a>).</p>

      <p><b>White House and alt-right</b>: Trump senior adviser for immigration policy <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/stephen-miller">Stephen Miller</a></b> is facing calls from dozens of Democrats to resign after newly released emails showed he circulated material linked to white nationalism to editors at Breitbart News before he joined the West Wing staff.

Boeing prompted federal consternation when it said it expected the FAA to certify the 737 Max in mid-December, information that sent its stock soaring. U.S. officials privately said last week that Boeing’s timetable was aggressive — if not unrealistic — and was not cleared in advance by regulators (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-airshow-boeing/boeing-says-timing-of-737-max-return-in-hands-of-regulators-idUSKBN1XQ0BW">Reuters</a>).

      <p>➔ <b>Venice</b>: The spellbinding, magical place that Lord Byron once described as “a fairy city of the heart” has suffered three historically high and devastating episodes of flooding in the last week, with damages estimated by Venice’s mayor at hundreds of millions of Euros. Italian officials declared a state of emergency for the area. Officials say Venice is sinking into the mud and facing rising sea levels due to climate change. Floods also hit other parts of Italy, including Pisa and Florence (<a href="https://apnews.com/343886375fcb49e58ee188ddab0fbb0e">The Associated Press</a>). </p>

        <u>THE CLOSER</u>

      <p><i>And finally …</i> This is the end for legions of fans of <b>Bei Bei</b>, the giant panda at the Smithsonian National Zoo. Visitors have been saying good-bye for weeks to the star attraction that was born at the zoo. He’s heading on Tuesday to China as part of a diplomatic agreement that requires the happy-go-lucky, personable panda to live there after age 4 as part of a breeding program.</p>
      <p>The National Zoo has hosted <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/events/bye-bye-bei-bei">“farewell” events</a>, encouraging admirers and young panda visitors to write postcards to Bei Bei, deposited in a mailbox next to his outdoor habitat. The postcards will make the 16-hour flight with Bei Bei to China, along with <b>Laurie Thompson</b>, the assistant curator of giant pandas and the zoo’s longest-serving giant panda keeper (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-end-of-an-era-as-a-zookeeper-and-her-giant-panda-say-goodbye/2019/11/12/e935a962-0499-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html">The Washington Post</a>).</p>
      <p><i>“I think there’s going to be some tears,</i>” Thompson said. “<i>To leave him in a new place, although I know he’ll be getting great care, it’s just sad.” </i></p>
