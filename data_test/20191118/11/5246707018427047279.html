      <p>In a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/video-interview/2019/11/15/110-rapid-fire-questions-with-overwatch-2s-jeff-kaplan">recent quick-fire video interview</a> with <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/overwatch_legendary_edition"><b>Overwatch</b></a>'s Game Director Jeff Kaplan, Game Informer asked the Blizzard VP not only which Overwatch character he'd love to see join the <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> roster (which <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/overwatch_director_would_pick_tracer_to_represent_the_game_in_smash_bros_ultimate">we already know is Tracer</a>), but also which Nintendo character from Masahiro Sakurai's epic brawler would be a good fit were they to join the heroes in Overwatch or the upcoming <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/overwatch_2">Overwatch 2</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Of the plethora of possibilities, Kaplan would apparently head to Hyrule if the possibility ever arose and add the Hero of Time himself to Blizzard's team-based shooter. In a wide-ranging 13-minute video which sees Kaplan answer 110 questions, Nintendo fans might want to skip to the 3:10 mark in the video on <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/video-interview/2019/11/15/110-rapid-fire-questions-with-overwatch-2s-jeff-kaplan">Game Informer's site</a> where you'll hear this choice quote:</p>
      <blockquote>"Nothing would make me happier than putting Link into our game."</blockquote>
      <p>To be clear, this came in the context of a rapid-fire barrage of questions and shouldn't be taken as any sort of confirmation or intention of a crossover, but it's interesting to think how Link would fit in with the other heroes in Blizzard's FPS. Link <i>does</i> have form when it comes to first-person shooting, and we're not just talking about <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/links_crossbow_training">Link's Crossbow Training</a></b>. The green-garbed one frequently switches to first-person when it comes to wielding projectile weapons in his 3D adventures, so of all the characters in Smash Bros. Ultimate, we think he'd fit in quite well in Overwatch.</p>
