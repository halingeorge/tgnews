      <h3>SYLVIA Sanchez continues to reap praises from netizens for her crackerjack acting as Luz Mabunga, the sacrificing wife and mom in “Pamilya Ko”. Her performance in that heartbreaking scene where she discovers her husband Joey Marquez as Fernan’s affair with her boss, Irma Adlawan as Loida, trended on Twitter and got her some glowing reviews. Good acting really runs in their veins as her son, Arjo Atayde, also harvested positive comments after the preview of the new season of iWant’s “Bagman” just a couple of days ago.</h3>
      <p>Both mom and son, along with daughter Ria, are at the blessing and ribbon-cutting of Sylvia’s new store, Sylvia Sanchez by Beautederm located at 68 Roces Avenue at the corner of Sct. Reyes St. last Sunday afternoon. This is Sylvia’s second Beautederm store. The first one is in her hometown, Butuan City.</p>
      <p>By February, the first SM mall in Butuan will open and Sylvia will also have a branch there. Then in 2020, she says she will open three more stores in three SM Malls in Metro Manila, with the help of the indefatigable Beautederm president-CEO Rhea Anicoche-Tan who’s also celebrating her birthday.</p>
      <p>“Grabe talaga ang popularity ng Beautederm products among those who want to have good skin kaya naman selling like hotcakes talaga ang mga sabon and creams nila,” says Sylvia. “Itong store ko sa Roces Avenue, sinimulan ko lang ito, but kay Ria talaga ito. Gusto kong tulungan ang mga anak ko na magkaroon ng sarili nilang business through Beautederm. You can get the smooth clear skin you've always wanted by using Beautéderm Products that are safe, effective, and Superbrands awardee. They are safe and dermatologically tested to deliver amazing results in as early as 1 week. Their best seller is the Beautederm regular set that comes with a papaya soap, four face creams, and one day and night toner. You can get them from our store with big discounts as part of our opening sale.”</p>
      <p>A lot of stars attended the ribbon cutting affair of Sylvia’s new store, a lot of them also Beautederm endorsers. The stars we saw include Lorna Tolentino, Gabby Concepcion, Ken Chan, Ejay Falcon, Nova Villa, Jestoni Alarcon, Ryle Santiago and mom Sherilyn Tan, Shyr Valdez, singer Dessa, comedians Kitkat and Smokey Manaloto, beauty queens Alma Concepcion and Maricel Morales, Pauline Mendoza, Rochelle Barrameda and husband Jimwell Stevens and, of course, Sylvia’s own kids, Arjo and Ria Atayde and her entire family. To Sylvia and Rhea Tan, here’s wishing your partnership will continue to succeed and prosper!</p>
