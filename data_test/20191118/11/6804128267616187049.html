      <h1>What Pellegrini's previous comments on the January transfer window mean for West Ham in 2020</h1>
      <h2>The winter window is looming on the horizon and the Hammers boss isn't usually busy in the market</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:04:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:04</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Since West Ham started their slump in form which has seen them go winless in six games, focus has switched to the January transfer window and what the manager can do to strengthen the team.</p>
      <p>A lot obviously depends on is there is any budget available for Pellegrini and director of football Mario Husillos to spend on new recruits or whether they will have to dip into the loan and free agent market.</p>
      <p>David Moyes brought Jordan Hugill to the club in January 2018 but he has been the only permanent recruit in the past 12 months during the winter window. Midfielder Joao Mario also arrived the same month under Moyes and in 2019, only free agent Samir Nasri arrived but that didn't go to plan. Mario was a relative success but Hugill has spent the bulk of his time at the club away on loan elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini has never been a big fan of the January transfer window if you look at his time at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>He did sign Wilfried Bony from Swansea in January 2015 for nearly £30m and that didn't pan out well as the manager is seemingly reluctant to use the winter window, as are many managers as there is little value for money.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the 2019 window closed and with Nasri's arrival, Pellegrini also wanted to bring in Besiktas midfielder Gary Medel but in the end didn't because the manager thought it would be a free transfer - but it wasn't.</p>

      <p>He said about the lack of activity: "I am not frustrated because all the names came from the media,</p>
      <p>"A lot of clubs offer players a lot of money but they don't want to pay for those players, so the players want to go and their performances aren't the same.</p>
      <p>"In every country, the January transfer window is similar. When you have the option to improve your team, every team starts moving. Maybe here in England, the clubs have more money so they can do more, more changes, but I think it is similar everywhere."</p>
      <p>"The January window does not offer many solutions."</p>
      <p>That won't be music to the ears of many West Ham fans who are craving for the club to purchase at the very least a box-to-box midfielder and potentially another striker in January to bolster what is a struggling squad. On paper it is strong, but lacking depth and after their recent form, confidence as well.</p>

      <p>Pellegrini and Husillos are coming under scrutiny for their summer signings in 2019 right now. Pablo Fornals has struggled to get going in claret and blue, Roberto has been a disaster since replacing Lukasz Fabianski in goal and Sebastien Haller has netted just once since August following his club-record £45m move from Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Roberto is already being linked with an unlikely move away from the club after his less than stellar spell between the sticks where he has proved to be a good shot stopper</p>
