      <p><b>Single Mothers</b> have been gradually unveiling previously unreleased non-album tracks as they stay busy touring this year. They recently released <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/single-mothers-return-with-new-single-metropolis-touring-listen/">“Metropolis,”</a> which was recorded just before last year’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/single-mothers-surprise-release-new-album-through-a-wall-announce-tour/"><i>Through A Wall</i></a>, and we’ve now got the premiere of a song from the sessions for 2017’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/single-mothers-announce-new-album-our-pleasure-share-undercover/"><i>Our Pleasure</i></a>, “Nihilist Headlights,” along with its Andrew Friesen-directed video. The song is a ripper; it’s as good as anything on <i>Our Pleasure</i> and doesn’t sound like a “leftover” or anything. Frontman/main member Drew Thomson says:</p>
      <blockquote>I thought all the B-sides from ‘Our Pleasure’ were really good. Brandon, Justis, Ross and I worked so well together we ended up recording 17 songs in that session. I had it in my head I wanted a 10 song record so we had to cut some, looking back – probably didn’t have to. ‘Army Green’ and ‘Skylight’ went on a 7” that accompanied the album and I kind of forgot about the rest until I was digging through a hard drive and found a folder with the others. After pulling up ‘Nihilist Headlights’ it brought me right back to that time and how fun it was to be writing and recording music again with my friends. I’ve often said I think ‘Our Pleasure’ is our best record – but I think I mean more than that – it was the time and the excitement and change. I quit drinking during this record – started finding myself (however lame that sounds). I do think ‘Our Pleasure’ is our best record so far – but I also think that was the best era of the band as a whole – and all the songs, even the ones that are still just on that hard drive – I’m proud to have been apart of and will always be thankful to my friends for being there and helping me through that time. I’m glad we can share this song – and move on once again.</blockquote>
