      <h1>Chuck E. Cheese Is Removing All of It's Creepy Animatronic Animal Characters</h1>

      <p>Chuck E. Cheese has finally decided to update its kids-themed entertainment restaurants. I’m sure you all remember that classic and creepy band of animatronic animal characters that inspired Five Nights at Freddy’s. Well, those characters that made up Munch's Make Believe Band are being removed from every single Chuck E. Cheese location.</p>
      <p>Chuck E. Cheese is going to be redesigning its locations to look more sleek and modern, and instead of the classic animal band, there will be an interactive dance floor for kids to have some fun on. Chuck E. Cheese himself will appear every hour. They are also removing the tokens, which will be replaced with play cards that you can add money to, which is what most gaming places are doing these days.</p>
      <p>The exteriors of Chuck E. Cheese's are also getting an overhaul as the logo and color scheme will be made to look more inviting. We’ve included some concept art thanks to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chuck-e-cheese-ditching-animatronic-band-getting-rid-of-tokens-as-part-of-nationwide-redesign">Fox News</a>.</p>
      <p>I haven’t been to Chuck E. Cheese for years, but this has been one of the last places that hasn’t really been updated since the early 90s. These changes will certainly take away the nostalgic factor, but after all these years of not changing, I guess it’s time for a change.</p>
