      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/logan-paul">Logan Paul</a> plans to appeal the decision in his loss to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ksi">KSI</a> in the money-spinning <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Youtube">YouTube</a> rematch.</p>
      <p>The American was adjudged to have hit KSI behind the head by referee Jack Reiss after dropping the Brit in the fourth round.</p>
      <p>The judgement led to a two-point deduction and an eventual split decision points defeat, with the judges returning one card 56-55 in Paul’s favour, but the other two judges (57-54, 56-55) proved decisive to hand KSI the win.</p>
      <p>“We just don’t believe the outcome was right,” Logan Paul announced on his YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>“By no means am I afraid of losing, but I truthfully 100 per cent believe I did not lose the fight.</p>
      <p>“This is a plea to the California State Athletic Commission, and I hope they give this the weight it deserves because I fear that since we aren’t real professional fighters that this may be overlooked.”</p>
      <p>Paul also claims he allowed his emotions to impact his performance.</p>
      <p>“I let emotions get the best of me man,” said Paul, when watching the replay of his infringement. “But, I will say, no warning, and I got two points taken away from me, and that’s why I think I lost tonight.</p>

      <p>“I think if you do the math, the two points that I had taken away from me was the reason I lost tonight.</p>
      <p>“I would love to contest the commission, because I think I should have got a warning.”</p>
