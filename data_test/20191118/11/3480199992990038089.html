      <p>Aldi, in Spytty Road, Newport, reopened last week.</p>
      <p>The company said it took the decision to extend the store due to demand in the area.</p>
      <p>The refurbishment means the new-look store now has wider aisles and clearer signs.</p>
      <p>Terri Thomas, manager of the store, said: “The team and I thoroughly enjoyed welcoming customers back into store this morning.</p>
      <p>“It was great to see some familiar faces.</p>
      <p>“We’re delighted that we can offer Newport shoppers quality products at fantastic prices.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to welcoming more shoppers into the new look store over the coming weeks.”</p>
      <p>The store will now be open from 8am to 10pm, Monday to Saturday, and 10am to 4pm on Sunday.</p>
