      <h3>A one-year-old girl died after she slipped on a sidewalk and was accidentally hit by a sports utility vehicle (SUV) driven by a woman Sunday evening in Navotas City.</h3>
      <p>Elijah Tiffany Salvador, of No. 18A Leongson St. in Bgy. San Roque, succumbed to severe body injuries while being rushed to Navotas City Hospital. The driver of the vehicle involved identified as Meldy Santos, also a resident of Leongson Street, immediately fled after the accident.</p>
      <p>Navotas police chief Col. Rolando Balasabas said the incident happened at around 6:30 p.m. at the corner of Leongson and Pat De Asis Streets in Bgy. San Roque.</p>
      <p>The child was slowly walking on the sidewalk together with Rachelle Anne Solomon, 26, when the child slipped at the gutter and fell on the road. She was then accidentally hit by a passing SUV (WIQ-694) driven by Santos.</p>
      <p>The suspect’s cousin Andrew Mendoza said Santos panicked, alighted from the vehicle and immediately fled.</p>
      <p>Police said it was Mendoza who rushed the child to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Col. Balasabas said charges of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide will be filed against Santos before the Navotas City Prosecutor’s Office.</p>
