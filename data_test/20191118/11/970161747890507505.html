      <h1>Laurence Fox goes on rant about Prince Harry and Meghan and Time's Up protest</h1>

      <p>Actor Laurence Fox has gone on a rant against royals and celebrities as he promoted his album, A Grief Observed, that was penned as a rebuttal against woke culture.</p>
      <p>First stop appeared to be those rallying for Time’s Up and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the former, in which female celebrities donned ‘revealing’ black dresses to call time on the rampant sexism in the entertainment industry, Laurence penned the song Dead In The Eye (which he originally wanted to call MeToo, but was banned by his record label).</p>
      <p>But he doesn’t let the lyrics do that talking, as<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/laurence-fox-interview-let-the-hipsters-hate-me-i-wont-dance-to-their-politically-correct-tune-5d7tdgwz7"> he told The Times</a>: ‘These people are very aware of the erotic nature of their costume yet totally unaware of the hypocrisy of the message. It’s not really a very musical subject matter, is it?’</p>

      <p>Laurence – best known as his role as Detective Sergeant Hathaway in Lewis –  took aim at so-called ‘virtue-signalling’ as he also spoke about the some 100 celebrities who put their signature on an <a href="https://rebellion.earth/2019/10/16/celebrities-backing-extinction-rebellion-say-yes-we-are-all-hypocrites-in-open-letter-to-media/">open letter by Extinction Rebellion</a> in which they admitted their ‘hypocrisy’ at having a large carbon footprint through their jetsetting lifestyles.</p>

      <p>‘You’re just like, “F**k off!” Why is no one saying to them, “Don’t say it”?’ 41-year-old Laurence, who was married to Billie Piper and shares two sons with the actor, continued.</p>
      <p>‘Or look at Prince Harry and Meghan: they’re ultra-woke, but when they’re on their little private jet they don’t think it’s bad. I cannot deal with the hypocrisy.’</p>

      <p>The actor admits he’s becoming ‘increasingly intolerant’ due to his views, as he said: ‘I say, “Can we just get on and not be mean to each other?” But I feel compelled to be mean to the wokies.’</p>
      <p>To him, if everyone only said the ‘correct’ thing he’d believed the world’s ‘going to die of boredom’.</p>
      <p>His comments come after last month the likes of Mel B, Peter Capaldi, Steve Coogan, Bob Geldof, Vanessa Kirby, Sienna Miller, and Radiohead’s Thom Yorke all signed the letter with Extinction Rebellion during <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/oxford-street-brought-to-standstill-again-by-extinction-rebellion-10942373/">its headline-grabbing protests.</a></p>

      <p>Beginning the message, the stars say ‘you’re right’ in calling them hypocrites due to their ‘high carbon lives’ and the carbon footprints of the industries in which they’ve made their money.</p>
      <p>However the celebrity signatories were resolute in speaking out on the worsening issue of climate change and ‘ecological emergency’ though, feeling it a much more important story than that of their private jet dwelling.</p>
