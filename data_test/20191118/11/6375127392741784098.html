      <h3>Senator says P50M SEAG cauldron is an extravagance.</h3>
      <p>The 30th Southeast Asian Games is less than two weeks away, but disruptions, questions and more won’t just fade away.</p>
      <p>The latest to receive brickbat was the cauldron that will bear the symbolic Southeast Asian Games flame to be lit during the opening ceremonies of the 30th edition of the meet on Nov. 30 at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>
      <p>Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon yesterday questioned the cost of the cauldron, saying “P50 million is an extravagance that is so unnecessary and somebody has to answer for this”.</p>
      <p>“We do away with 50 classrooms to build a P50-million kaldero that we use only once? I am not even talking about overpricing. I’m talking about propriety,” said Drilon at the Senate hearing on the proposed budget of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority.</p>
      <p>“’Yung isang silid ng paaralan P1 million, ito 50 na silid-paaralan ang nabuo sana kung hindi ganito kalaki ang pangaabuso sa pondo ng taumbayan,” the opposition senator said.</p>
      <p>According to Drilon, the breakdown of the amount is P4.4 million for the design by late Filipino architect Bobby Manosa, P13.4 million for the cost of the cauldron’s foundation and P32 million for the construction of the cauldron itself.</p>
      <p>Sen. Sonny Angara, chairman of the Senate finance committee, defended the proposed budget put forward by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, saying the government prepared for the SEA Games to showcase its ability to host sports events.</p>
      <p>The facilities will be made available for rent for income following the Games, according to Angara.</p>
      <p>Last week, Drilon grilled Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, the Senate’s sports committee chairman, over a similar issue.</p>
      <p>Drilon said he was concerned that, without concrete post-Games plans for the facilities, they could turn into white elephants. Maintaining the structures will reportedly cost P150 million to P200 million a year.</p>
      <p>“I think this has not been thought out, because this will be a burden on the budget with the maintenance cost,” Drilon said.</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry, but I cannot believe we can generate enough funds even just to maintain this. And what will happen is that, because of a lack of funds to maintain, these facilities will deteriorate over time.”</p>
      <p>Drilon also told reporters that he will file a resolution after the SEA Games to ask for a Senate probe into the “extravagant’ expenses.</p>
      <p>“Kailangang suportahan natin sila (the athletes) so they can compete and bring hopnor to our country. But it doesn’t mean that we will not question these expenses,” Drilon said.</p>
      <p>Team Philippines will be represented by more than one thousand athletes during the biennial meet where the Filipinos are expected to win the overall championship on their homeground.</p>
      <p>A budget of more than one billion has been earmarked for the training and participation overseas of the Filipino athletes ahead of the SEA Games which unfolds in elaborate rites on Nov. 30.</p>
