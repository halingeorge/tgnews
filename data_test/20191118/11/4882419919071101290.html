      <p>Neymar Jr. has turned down the chance to renew his PSG contract which expires in 2022. The Brazilian does not want to pen a deal until 2025 and instead is thinking about Barcelona. He is only at PSG still because president Nasser Al-Khelaifi would not let him go to Camp Nou in the summer. Staying in Paris is not his priority.</p>
      <p>Negotiations between Neymar's father and PSG started last season, even though the player wants to leave and tried to force his way out. PSG want to tie Neymar down, but Neymar's dad keeps putting fat demands on the table, making any deal very hard.</p>
      <p>PSG are trying to renew the spine of their team - Marquinhos, Thiago Silva (on standby as they will only offer a short contract because of his age - 35), Meunier and Verratti, with whom there is a deal already.</p>
      <p>Cavani and Kurzawa's time in Paris is up and they will leave on free transfers in the summer. The Uruguayan, 33, will not lack suitors.</p>
