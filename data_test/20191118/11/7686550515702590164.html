      <p>A cold or flu can knock you out for days with a bad enough virus seeing you confined to bed for two or three days.</p>
      <p>But according to experts, if you tackle the symptoms early enough you can ward off a cold before it really begins, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10332731/get-rid-of-cold-24-hours/">reports The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>If you wake up feeling like a cold is coming on, the best thing is to have a hot shower.</p>
      <p>Professor Ron Eccles, a cold-and-flu expert at Cardiff University, says starting the day with a hot shower can 'loosen secretions' in our noses as the steams helps clear blocked sinuses.</p>
      <p>The warm water can also bring relief to the aching limbs we often experience when we fall ill.</p>
      <p>Oranges, kiwi and berries for breakfast will then give you a Vitamin C boost - whoch can reduce the length of a cold or flu.</p>
      <p>But nutritionist Amanda Ursell says to avoid tea or coffee, as well as energy drinks, because caffeine can dehydrate you further.</p>
      <p>Nutritional therapist Julie Silver recommends also using a saltpipe - an inhaler designed to help improve our respiratory systems - to alleviate coughing and sneezing. They can be bought online for around £15.</p>
      <p>GP Dr Sarah Brewer recommends staying inside and keeping warm if you feeling a cold coming on.</p>
      <p>"If the nose gets too cold, these immune systems don’t work properly, so you are more susceptible to infection," she said.</p>
      <p>"Staying indoors also limits the spread of infection. If you have to go out, wear a scarf around your nose to keep it warm and, if necessary, use a moisturising nasal spray."</p>
      <p>Ears, nose and throat specialist Adam Frosh says soup is warm, nutritious and makes us feel better and advises to stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water.</p>
      <p>Alcohol can dehydrate you further so it's best to stay off the booze for a bit - and he recommends paracetamol and ibuprofen to fight the symptoms.</p>
      <p>Nutritionist Amanda recommended snacking on nuts, as they contain selenium which supports our immune systems.</p>
      <p>And Amanda said the hot spices can irritate the lining of your nose, making it easier to clear and helping us feel 'instantly' better - so go for something spicy like chili or curry.</p>
