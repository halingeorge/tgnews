      <p>WE have to find out the real reasons, do a post-mortem and take appropriate action to address the problem, said Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow at a press conference yesterday.</p>

      <p>The Penang DAP government, responding to criticism by civil society of its developer-initiated  development projects has always been snobbishly saying a huge number of Penangites (about 90% who voted for them) agreed with its environment-destroying, developer-friendly projects, such as the Penang South Reclamation.</p>
      <p>To “prove” this, it stooped very low to get “support” for its transport master plan that includes reclaiming three islands totalling 4,500 acres from the rich fishing grounds south of the island by putting up public display booths of the project and asking people to answer three leading questions.</p>
      <p>The majority of Penangites are ignorant of the details of the projects and the effects they will have on the environment and ecology of the Island.</p>
      <p>These people can be easily mesmerised by beautiful pictures and models of the projects. They can thus be influenced to feel “proud” that Penang will have this and that (e.g. the only undersea tunnel in this part of the world) and answer the questions to support projects the negative effects of which they understand nothing about.</p>
      <p>Such a survey is fraudulent to say the least, but the state government is unashamedly carrying it out to fraudulently show it has the support of large numbers of Penangites.  </p>
      <p>It claims to have the support of about 90% of Penangites who voted for it because they know that “the government knows best what is good for Penang and Penangites”.</p>
      <p>After Tg Piai, does the Penang DAP government still hold firmly that the 90% of Penangites who voted for it, gave it a blank cheque to do what “it feels is best for them” without paying any heed to the voices of civil society that have very good or even excellent reasons to object to some of the projects?</p>
      <p>For example, the Penang South Reclamation project is going to destroy in perpetuity a very rich sea-food producing area.</p>
      <p>This fact is stated by the agriculture ministry, not by some uninformed persons.</p>
      <p>Scientists are warning that by 2050 this planet is going to face a food crisis, besides rising sea levels due to climate change.</p>
      <p>The Penang government however, doesn’t care about food security, it is more concerned about helping developers to make money so that Penang’s economy “grows” impressively.</p>
      <p>If the Penang state government feels that civil society is not relevant, that the 90% or so voters who voted for it are fully supportive of those projects, then it should take a very bold step by dissolving itself and going back to the voters to confirm the massive support of Penangites that it claims it has.</p>
      <p>Call it a re-election of the state government or a referendum, but do it to prove the level of support it has today.</p>
      <p>The very same DAP members who were speaking in defence of the fragile environment of Penang when they were in the opposition are today, when in power, speaking for the destruction of that same environment.</p>
      <p>They are delusional if they think that they are voted in to do anything they like.</p>
      <p>So, dissolve the state assembly and test the support to see whether it is just as strong, or even stronger with all the mega projects being shoved on Penangites who will have to pay for them for many, many generations to come.</p>
      <p>This will be the best post-mortem of Tg Piai. – November 18, 2019.</p>
