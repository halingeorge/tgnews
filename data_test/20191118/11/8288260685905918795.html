      <p>Birmingham Edgbaston was once considered to be a safe Conservative seat, but it's had a Labour MP since 1997.</p>
      <p>The Tories have attempted to win the seat back in a number of elections since then, but they have not been succesful.</p>
      <p>Since then, the constituency has changed and it's no longer a Tory target seat. However, it's still marginal enough that anything could happen in this election.</p>
