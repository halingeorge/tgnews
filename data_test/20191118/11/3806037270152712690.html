      <p>Over the weekend in Atlanta a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/colin-kaepernick-private-nfl-workout-football">private NFL workout</a> was held for former San Francisco 49ers quaterback and social activist <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/colin-kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a>.</p>
      <p>During the event, only <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/colin-kaepernick-private-nfl-workout-football">six of the confirmed 11 teams</a> came out to take a look at the free agent in action. The workout was initially set to take place at 3 p.m. ET at the Falcon’s training facility. However Kap and his team decided to change the time and locale to Charles Drew High School in Riverdale, Georgia — which is more than 50 miles away from the Falcon’s training facility in Flowery Branch — at the last minute after the league denied them several requests.</p>
      <p>“From the outset, Mr. Kaepernick requested a legitimate process and from the outset the NFL league office has not provided one,” the statement read. “Most recently, the NFL has demanded that as a precondition to the workout, Mr. Kaepernick sign an unusual liability waiver that addresses employment-related issues and rejected the standard liability waiver from physical injury proposed by Mr. Kaepernick’s representatives. Additionally, Mr. Kaepernick requested all media be allowed into the workout to observe and film it and for an independent film crew to be there to ensure transparency.”</p>
      <p>The league responded to the change in a lengthy statement, in which it claimed to have agreed to a number of Kaepernick’s requests.</p>
      <p>“We are disappointed that Colin did not appear for his workout. He informed us of that decision at 2:30 p.m. today along with the public,” the NFL wrote. “Today’s session was designed to give Colin what he has consistently said he wants — an opportunity to show his football readiness and desire to return to the NFL. Twenty-five (25) clubs were present for the workout, and all 32 clubs, their head coaches, general managers, and other personnel executives would have received video footage of the interview and workout, shot by the Atlanta Falcons video crew.”</p>
      <p>Along with the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nfl">NFL</a> representatives, numerous Colin supporters, protesters, and media members gathered at Charles Drew High School. Kap enlisted the help of four NFL free-agents including Eric Reid during the workout. When the event concluded, Kap signed autographs and thanked the media before explaining the change in location, stating, “Our biggest thing with everything today was making sure we had transparency in what went on. We weren’t getting that elsewhere, so we came out here. It’s important that y’all are here. Y’all been attacked for the last three years … we appreciate what y’all do, we appreciate you being here today, we appreciate the work you do for the people and telling the truth.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “I’ve been ready for three years, I’ve been denied for three years … We’re waiting for the 32 owners, the 32 teams, (commissioner of the NFL) Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running—stop running from the truth, stop running from the people … I’ve been ready, I’m staying ready, and I’ll continue to be ready … The ball’s in their court. We’re ready to go.”</p>
