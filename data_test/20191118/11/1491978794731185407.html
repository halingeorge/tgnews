      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolascage">Nicolas Cage</a> is to play himself in a film called The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, it has been announced.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/nicolas-cage-movie-the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-movie-lionsgate-1202787717/">Deadline reports</a> that Cage will play a fictionalised version of himself in what is described as a “meta” story, in which he is paid $1m to attend a wealthy superfan’s birthday party. According to the plot description, he has to “become a version of some of his most iconic and beloved characters in order to extricate himself from an increasingly dangerous situation”.</p>
      <p>Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten, creators of the paranormal-investigators TV comedy Ghosted, are behind the script, with Gormican lined up to direct.</p>
      <p>The idea inevitably recalls the surreal comedy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/29/being-john-malkovich-charlie-kaufman-review">Being John Malkovich</a>, written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze, in which a puppeteer played by John Cusack discovers a portal that takes him inside Malkovich’s head. Cage himself starred in a similarly tricksy Kaufman/Jonze project, the 2002 release <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/28/artsfeatures3">Adaptation</a>, in which he played a version of Kaufman and his (non-existent) twin brother as he wrestled with a screenplay adaptation of Susan Orlean’s The Orchid Thief.</p>
