      <p>A lot of modern-day smartphones feature gobs and gobs of storage but for the ones that don’t, there are always expandable microSD cards from companies like SanDisk. If your handset supports a 1TB microSD card, then you’ll absolutely love the company’s Extreme 1TB variant, which gets a massive $150 discount right over at Amazon. With the latest price cut, the SanDisk Extreme 1TB microSD card now costs $299.99, giving you ample storage in a form factor that’s as big as your fingernail. See how fast technology has come.</p>
      <h3>SanDisk Is a Reliable Name When It Comes to Storage</h3>
      <p>If you’re asking yourself, what’s so special about this storage card, well for starters, it’s 4K ready. What that means is the SanDisk Extreme 1TB microSD card can reach up to 160MB/s read speeds and 90MB/s write speeds for seamless 4K video recording from your smartphone, camera, or drone.</p>
      <p>This is made possible thanks to the UHS Speed Class 3 (U3) and Video Speed Class 30 (V30). In short, your videos won’t be laggy or skip a few frames because the high read and write speeds of the storage card will easily be able to keep up with the demanding bitrate of 4K video recording.</p>
      <p>Reliability is also a concern that a lot of customers display when making a purchase. Thankfully, the SanDisk Extreme 1TB microSD card has been tested in various controlled environments to make it a more resilient product. It can withstand higher temperatures, it’s water-resistant, shock-proof and X-ray proof.</p>
      <p>SanDisk also provides a manufacturer lifetime warranty and looking at all the safety measures incorporated, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll run into problems down the road. We’ve also included lower-capacity microSD cards belonging to the same SanDisk speed class so if you feel 1TB of expandable storage will be a little overkill, you can always opt for the others.</p>
