      <p>Dalot will likely find himself behind Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the pecking order this season, despite looking a decent prospect for United last term.</p>
      <p>There is now more competition for a place at right-back and it remains to be seen if Dalot will suffer as a result of having missed so much action.</p>
      <p>Still, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could probably also do with more depth in defence as he won’t want to keep relying on club veteran Ashley Young in that position.</p>
