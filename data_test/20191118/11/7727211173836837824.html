      <h1>Iker Casillas issues Ballon D'Or verdict on Virgil van Dijk and Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
      <h2>Iker Casillas believes Virgil van Dijk and Lionel Messi are more deserving of the Ballon D'Or crown than Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:21:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/josh-challies/" target="_blank">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Spain legend Iker Casillas believes that Virgil van Dijk or Lionel Messi should lift the Ballon D'Or next month ahead of his former Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>The winner from the 30-man shortlist will be announced at the France Football ceremony on December 2nd, with Van Dijk one of the front-runners for the crown alongside <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/lionel-messi">Messi</a> .</p>
      <p>After helping to guide Liverpool to Champions League glory and putting the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Reds</a> on the path towards a first league title in three decades, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/virgil-van-dijk">Van Dijk</a> is widely regarded to be a favourite to land the honour.</p>
      <p>However, he will face stiff competition from Barcelona superstar Messi after the Argentina international lifted his tenth La Liga title and finished top-scorer in European football.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> , a serial winner, is seen to be an outsider this year, with Messi already picking up 'The Best' award this term and Van Dijk being awarded the UEFA Player of the Year honour.</p>
      <p>In fact, Casillas believes that, should the honour be given to Ronaldo, it would show that the guidelines to decide who picks up the prestigious honours in world football are flawed.</p>
      <p>'Van Dijk was the best player for UEFA, Messi was the best for FIFA. Imagine if Cristiano wins the Ballon d'Or? It would seem to me that the guidelines we follow in football to give prizes do not have much logic,' the former Madrid goalkeeper tweeted.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk's chances of securing the Ballon D'Or crown are boosted by the fact that a player from a Champions League winning club has won the honour in nine of the last 12 years.</p>
      <p>He is not the only Liverpool man recognised in the shortlist though, as he is joined by team-mates Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Alisson Becker, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Georginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino.</p>
