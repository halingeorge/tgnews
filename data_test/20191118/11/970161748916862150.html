        <b>Judd Trump beat Ronnie O’Sullivan in the final of the Northern Ireland Open for the second year on the bounce, but praised the Rocket’s unique ability to deal with pressure despite his 9-7 defeat in Belfast.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world champion picked up his third ranking title of the season by beating O’Sullivan by exactly the same scoreline he managed in last year’s final.</p>
      <p>Trump bossed the match, taking the first two frames and remaining ahead for the entirety of the game, during which he made four centuries.</p>
      <p>The Rocket was always playing catch-up but also produced some magic moments of his own, including breaks of 135 and 126, in the losing effort.</p>
      <p>The world number one believes that O’Sullivan has a steely determination about him that he never used to have, and even when he’s not winning, has a unique aversion to the pressure of the game.</p>

      <p>‘I was just going with the flow, Ronnie was playing well as well so I knew every time I got in I had to score,’ Trump said after picking up the £70,000 top prize.</p>
      <p>‘He was probably the worst player from coming from behind, he used to just give up, but now he’s probably the best, he tries and tries his heart out till the end.</p>

      <p>‘He’s unlike anyone else because he doesn’t look like he feels pressure, his cue ball is so good. Mine, as I get under pressure I make sure of the pot a bit more, while he carries on as if no one’s out there.</p>
      <p>‘Just watching him helps me relax a little bit, just seeing how calm he is.’</p>
      <p>Trump has unquestionably surpassed the Rocket as the best player on the planet right now as he sits atop the world rankings as world champion.</p>
      <p>He has also built an impressive record against O’Sullivan, not only beating him in the last two Belfast finals, but also walloping the 43-year-old 10-4 in the Masters final this year.</p>
      <p>The world champ will look to continue his ruthless accumulation of silverware at the UK Championship which starts next week, where he hopes to take on O’Sullivan once again.</p>

      <p>‘It’s been a good start to the season. Hopefully some more games with Ronnie, I love playing him in the final and try to learn as much as I can from him every time I play him.</p>
      <p>‘I’m on a good run, you never know when it’s going to stop so I just play in everything and hopefully win as many tournaments as possible.’</p>
