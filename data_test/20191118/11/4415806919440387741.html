      <p>The road was closed this morning, causing major disruption to rush-hour traffic.</p>
      <p>The attack is the third ATM raid this weekend.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night, thieves tried but failed to steal a cash machine from Belfast City Hospital.</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, there was an attempted ATM theft on Main Street in Dunleer, Co Louth.</p>

      <p>Gardaí said a "significant amount of damage" was caused and a digger and lorry were left at the scene.</p>
      <p>Industry organisation Retail NI condemned the latest attacks.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Glyn Roberts said: “Words fail to describe my anger at this disgraceful attempted ATM robbery on one of our members.</p>
      <p>“This has caused extensive damage to one of Ballynahinch’s largest retailers in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>“This is an independent retailer, who provides an invaluable service to the local community, awakened from his sleep to be told his business is smashed up.</p>
      <p>“It is also a new low for these robbers to attack health centres to steal ATMs.</p>
      <p>“We would urge all businesses and organisations who have external ATMs to be vigilant and urge members of the public with any information to contact the PSNI.”</p>
