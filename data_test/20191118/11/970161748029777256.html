      <p>A man trying to put up Christmas lights ended up stranded so long he almost became part of the display.</p>
      <p>He was stuck for around two hours on a malfunctioning cherry-picker platform which would not go lower than seven metres off the ground.</p>
      <p>The landlady of a pub next door was trying to figure out how to bring him a pint up there, but he was finally rescued.</p>
      <p>Firefighters in Market Borough, Leicestershire, came to his aid and brought him back down to the ground yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Angela Denison manages the Nags Head pub on Church Street, said: ‘I was thinking poor old Church Street never has it easy when it comes to Christmas illuminations, does the man stuck up there want a pint and it’s a good job it’s not raining.</p>
      <p>‘Our customers enjoyed the unexpected entertainment, the ladies loved the arrival of all those fireman, especially when the impressive rescue equipment arrived.’</p>
