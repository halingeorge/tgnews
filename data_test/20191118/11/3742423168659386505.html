      <h1>How Cancelling Your Uber Ride Affects Drivers</h1>

      <p>If you’ve ever called an Uber—and waited longer than you’d like—you probably might feel tempted to cancel the ride altogether. In the end, you might end up paying a small fee for your driver’s time, the probable worst-case scenario. But there are several reasons why Uber’s existing policies, in particular, aren’t so great for drivers when you decide to cancel last-minute.</p>
      <p>Take, for example, the fact that the app pockets<i> </i>at least a partial amount of every fee when a rider cancels. On a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/8cwbdu/when_a_rider_disputes_the_5_cancellation_fee_does/">Reddit thread</a>, u/old-wave said they received just $US3.75 ($6) of their overall $US5 ($7) fee for every cancelation via Uber. (Meanwhile, apps like Lyft do not pocket <i>any part</i> of a rider’s cancelation fee that is owed to a driver.) That fee may not be significant, but given the recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/17/uber-drivers-are-protesting-again-heres-what-the-job-is-really-like.html">wave of criticism</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-strike-drivers-explain-why-theyre-protesting-2019-5">aimed</a> at Uber for its low pay and general working conditions, it has enormous implications in the long run.</p>

      <p>It’s also not entirely clear whether Uber <i>or</i> the driver ends up absorbing the fee if a passenger disputes the cancelation charge and receives a “refund”—typically, just a credit toward a future ride. While using Uber recently and attempting to dispute a charge, I received an alert that indicated that the driver might lose out if I chose to dispute it. (I had chosen to cancel because Uber’s app had failed to show the status of my ride, yet it guilt-tripped me into paying for the fee. When asked specifically about the issue of Uber “glitching” and being at fault for a cancelation, a rep for Uber did not directly answer my question, and instead, directed me back to their website which explained their cancelation fees.)</p>
      <p>Worse, Uber has the right to keep some of their drivers’ cancelation fees altogether, if they believe payments were done in “error, [were] fraudulent, or in violation of Driver terms.” According to one former Uber driver who had dealt with this firsthand, however, sometimes cancelation fees are withheld without any apparent reason.</p>
      <p>“I have had three instances now where I waited over five minutes before cancelling, took screenshots to prove I waited the full time, cancelled the ride, and then never received the fee ...” he said. “This is completely different from the consumer’s side, where if a passenger simply says ‘My driver was under the influence [of] alcohol’ with no evidence, the passenger gets a refund, that driver can lose the pay from that ride, have their account immediately suspended for a minimum of three days, and possibly even [become] permanently deactivated.”</p>
      <p>What does this mean for you? Well, if you do cancel a ride, understand what it means to dispute any charge. Unless your driver has picked you up from the wrong location or made any other major transit error, don’t automatically request a refund for the cancelation fee in-app because it’s easy and probably might work.</p>
