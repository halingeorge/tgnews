      <h1>PUBG is getting rid of locked crates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:20:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds will soon be changing its crate and key systems.</p>
      <p><b>PUBG</b> developer PUBG Corp. has outlined a couple of major changes to the game’s reward system. As it stands, players are able to spend in game currency (BP) to get one of several crates (loot boxes).</p>
      <p>This process is random, and more often than not, players end up with a locked crate. Locked crates require a key, which can be purchased on the Steam Marketplace, essentially cheating players out of their reward unless they pay to unlock it.</p>
      <p>Beginning December 18, locked crate will be phased out. From that point on, crates purchased with BP will always be free to open. Going forward, PUBG Corp. won’t be releasing other locked crates.</p>
      <p>The developer is also increasing the quality of crate skins to make them comparable to direct-purchase, premium skins. Although the process of acquiring the included skins is still random, PUBG Corp. wants to better distribute their content among the different rarities.</p>
      <p>This also means you’re more likely to end up with a top as well as mid-tier items. The first crate to release under the new rules is the Venetian Crate, which includes an assortment of weapon skins.</p>
      <p>You’ll still be able to purchase existing locked crates, and their keys, from the marketplace, as well as sell/open what you may already own.</p>
      <p>“We have been thinking about this carefully and we want to ensure that we steer clear of revenue models that fail to satisfy fans, especially if they include a low success rate,” wrote Sujin Kim, item production developer.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to tweak our business model where possible to offer more compelling value for the money you choose to spend with us.”</p>
