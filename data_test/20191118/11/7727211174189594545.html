      <p>An imitation firearm sparked concern from police - while others shared a joke about the 'Jack Sparrow' - style pretend weapon.</p>
      <p>Police in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/widnes">Widnes</a> posted on its Twitter and Facebook feeds that a community support officer (PCSO) had discovered the apparent flintlock pistol in bushes on Scott Avenue on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The gun turned out to be a fake.</p>
      <p>The find led to plenty of jokes online, with many residents drawing comparisons with the guns used by Jack Sparrow, the leading character in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean films.</p>

      <p>One commenter said: "Suspect has been sighted captaining an ocean going vessel by the name of the Black Pearl."</p>
      <p>Another said: "How quaint, possibly could have been used in a ye olde avo duel! I thought chivalry was dead, how wrong I am."</p>
      <p>The item even drew the attention of a poster in North America, who said: "I am from Canada and quality contents (SIC) like this one attracted me.</p>
      <p>"You don’t want the peasants and blacksmith to storm the castle." <br/> </p>

      <p>Another person said: "Jesus Christ who hid that? Someone from the Napoleon war in 1803?"</p>
      <p>One Facebook user had a more practical idea - and said: "If it’s an imitation fire arm could it not be given to a local theatre group as a prop?</p>
      <p>"Seems more worthwhile than destroying it if it poses no danger."</p>
