      <p>Ryan Babel has pulled out of the Netherlands squad ahead of Tuesday's final Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia.</p>
      <p>The Galatasaray forward was not "intact" after the 0-0 weekend draw with Northern Ireland and has returned to his club, according to statement from the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB).</p>
      <p>Babel, 32, started in Belfast and lasted until the 90th minute before making way for defender Nathan Ake.</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman has now lost three of the players who started Saturday's stalemate, which was enough to confirm the Oranje's qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk was released from the squad for personal reasons, while Martin de Roon is suspended after receiving a third yellow card.</p>
      <p>Netherlands are two points behind Group C leaders Germany going into their meeting with bottom-placed Estonia in Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Babel scored twice as Koeman's men ran out 4-0 winners when the teams met in Tallinn in September.</p>
