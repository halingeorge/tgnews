      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/matthew-perry">Matthew Perry</a> shared a meme on <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewPerry">Twitter</a> of his <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/friends">“Friends”</a> character Chandler Bing dancing around in a similar style to Joaquin Phoenix’s incarnation of the Joker.</p>
      <p>Perry shared the side-by-side comparison entitled “cinematic parallels” with the caption: “You’re welcome.”</p>

      <p>The memorable “Friends” scene from season four sees Chandler explain to Rachel that he doesn’t dance at weddings because “weddings are a great place to meet women and when I dance, I look like this,” before proceeding to show off his dorky dance moves.</p>

      <p>While the Joker's iconic dance down the Bronx staircase may be a little different, the meme does provide a convincing argument that Chandler could have been a source of inspiration for Phoenix.</p>
      <p>The actor also acknowledged he wasn't the original creator of the meme by <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewPerry/status/1195773426889154560?s=20">tweeting: "Sorry I don't know who the made image, but bravo." <br/>The wildly successful DC Comics film has seen plenty of memes since it was released, </a><a href="https://www.insider.com/joker-fans-take-over-bronx-staircase-to-pose-for-photos-2019-10">including fans recreating their own versions dancing down the Bronx staircase. <br/>"Friends" fans pointed out even more similarities between the odd pair after Perry's tweet, creating their own Chandler vs "Joker" memes.</a></p>
