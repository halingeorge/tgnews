      <h3>Lakers subdue Hawks</h3>
      <p>The results:</p>
      <p>LA Lakers 122, Atlanta 101; Orlando 125, Washington 121; New Orleans 108, Golden State 100; Denver 131, Memphis 114;  Philadelphia 114, Cleveland 95; Sacramento 100, Boston 99</p>
      <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Bahamian guard Buddy Hield scored a season-high 35 points and the Sacramento Kings snapped the Boston Celtics’ 10-game NBA win streak with a 100-99 home triumph on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sacramento center Richaun Holmes sank two decisive free throws with 13 seconds remaining to give the Kings their fifth win in seven games after an 0-5 start.</p>
      <p>“Thank God we were able to pull off this win. Definitely needed this win,” Hield said. “We’ve got to stay locked in and stay focused and be ready for every challenge every night.</p>
      <p>“We know what we’re doing. We’re going to try to take it one game at a time and we’ll be fine.”</p>
      <p>Boston fell to 10-2, having not lost since their season opener three-and-a-half weeks ago at Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>The Celtics, led by Jaylen Brown’s 18 points, saw the end of their longest win streak since taking 16 in a row early in the 2017-18 campaign.</p>
      <p>Hield’s three-pointer with 1:52 remaining gave the Kings a 96-95 lead.</p>
      <p>Boston’s Jayson Tatum answered with a jumper but Hield, who went 14-of-24 from the floor, struck again with a fadeaway only for Boston to answer on a Daniel Theis dunk, giving the Celtics a 99-98 edge with 52 seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>Holmes was fouled going for a rebound by Boston’s Marcus Smart and sank two free throws to put the Kings ahead by the final margin.</p>
      <p>Smart missed a jumper for the win at the final buzzer and Sacramento had the victory.</p>
      <p>Serbian swingman Bogdan Bogdanovic had 12 points and 10 assists for the Kings while Serbian forward Nemanja Bjelica added 12 points and 14 rebounds for Sacramento.</p>
      <p>Boston guard Kemba Walker added 15 points and nine assists, Smart had nine assists, Brown grabbed eight rebounds, Tatum had 14 points and Theis contributed 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, LeBron James scored 33 points as the Los Angeles Lakers cruised to a 122-101 win over the struggling Atlanta Hawks.</p>
      <p>The Lakers jumped out to a 25-point lead in the first quarter and never looked back.</p>
      <p>Rajon Rondo scored 15 points and Anthony Davis added 14 as the Lakers posted their 11th win in their last 12 games since a season-opening loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.  </p>
      <p>Trae Young scored 31 points and Cam Reddish added 13 as the Hawks lost their third straight game.  </p>
      <p>Atlanta was blown out in Los Angeles for the second consecutive night after losing by 49 points to the Clippers.</p>
      <p>Also, Denver’s Jamal Murray scored 39 points and Paul Millsap added 23 to lead the Nuggets over host Memphis 131-114 for their fifth win in six road contests. Jaren Jackson led the Grizzlies with 22 points.</p>
      <p>Tobias Harris scored 27 points to lead six Philadelphia players in double figures as the 76ers rolled to a 114-95 triumph at Cleveland.</p>
