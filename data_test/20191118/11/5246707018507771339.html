      <p>One of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania's</a></b> most unique gameplay features was the addition of a 'drop dash' move which allows characters to roll into a wrecking ball the moment they hit the ground – but it turns out we <i>almost</i> had this move in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog_3">Sonic 3</a></b>, which was released decades earlier.</p>
      <p>A prototype version of the third Sonic game has appeared online and appears to come from a time just before the title was split in two to create Sonic 3 and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_and_knuckles"><b>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Originally planned to be a much grander 3D title that used the same chip that powered the Mega Drive / Genesis port of <b>Virtua Racing</b>, Sonic 3 would endure a difficult development before eventually making it to market. Back in the day, very little was shown off of the game before release; it is believed this prototype was a preview copy sent out to the official Sega magazine in the UK.</p>
