      <p>Two days later, he sent her a message on Instagram asking: “How much for a night with you?”</p>
      <p>She went back to confront him but he just smirked.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was fuming. I said it was totally unacceptable. I felt disgusted and violated and very upset.”</p>
      <p>Gabriella, of Southend, Essex, lodged a complaint with O2 and was offered a £100 gift voucher and flowers, which she refused.</p>
      <p>O2 said it was “truly very sorry” and that a full investigation and “corrective actions” had been taken.</p>
      <p>The O2 worker, whose identity is known to The Sun, was still working in the store on Friday.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun: “It’s being dealt with at head office, you’ll have to speak with them. I can’t remember what the messages said.”</p>
