        <b>UPDATE 11:17 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Interior Savings released a statement after activists were forcibly removed off their property for protesting in front of their downtown location.</p>
      <p>"This morning, Interior Savings had a protest group outside its Bernard location. The protestors are not permitting members to enter the building and the RCMP are aware of this situation. Interior Savings has met with the group to hear their concerns about sponsorship of Ribfest."</p>
      <p>Interior Savings’ approach is to work with groups across its membership to support events that bring the community together, are well-received by the public, and in many instances, raise tens of thousands of dollars to support the important work being done by local non-profits in our communities. </p>
      <p> Ribfest is one of those events, raising thousands of dollars to support local charities including Jo-Anna’s House – a home away from home for people whose families are receiving life-saving support from KGH.</p>
      <p>Ribfest offers free and accessible entertainment to everyone in the community. Like most community events, it offers a selection of food options to suit people’s preferences. Interior Savings’ appreciates and respects that everyone has a right to their opinion, to share their opinion and to choose a diet that makes sense for them.</p>
      <p>Interior Savings remains committed to supporting top-notch community events that raise tens of thousands of dollars for those in our community who need a helping hand."</p>

        <b>UPDATE 11:03 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The activists who chained themselves to the exterior of Interior Savings Credit Union in downtown Kelowna are now being forcibly removed.</p>
      <p>RCMP have read the protestors their rights and are now using bolt cutters to remove the chains and usher the protestors into a waiting RCMP cruiser.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>UPDATE 10:49 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the activists has gone inside the Interior Savings Credit Union to speak to representatives of the company.</p>
      <p>They have indicated that there was no resolution to the issue and the activists indicate they will remain on location until they are forcibly removed.</p>
      <p>"We want to disrupt their business as much as possible and raise awareness for animal agriculture."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>UPDATE 8:47 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the protestors, referring to herself as a "police liaison" tells Castanet the half dozen or so activists will remain chained to Interior Savings, preventing them from opening for business until the Credit Union cuts all ties with Ribfest. Teghan Gordey called Ribfest "non-progressive" and wants Interior Savings to pull their sponsorship of the event.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>UPDATE 8:38 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kelowna RCMP are on the scene of a protest outside the Interior Savings Credit Union in downtown Kelowna.</p>
      <p>Sgt. Greg Woodcox tells Castanet, he has spoken to bank staff and they are working towards a resolution, "obviously they can't remain chained to the doors forever."</p>
      <p>Woodcox says RCMP are talking to both sides and they are trying to facilitate communication between the two sides.</p>
      <p>Interior Savings Credit Union opens at 9:30 a.m.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>UPDATE 8:10 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Demonstrators say they chose Interior Savings because,"the bank, plays a big role in sponsoring not only the Kelowna RibFest, but other RibFest’s across BC," activist Amy Soranno says, “festivals like these cannot happen without sponsors donating money, therefore we are calling on Interior Savings to stop supporting a festival that destroys our environment and supports farms that have been proven to conduct criminal animal cruelty”.</p>
      <p>The activists outside of Interior Savings are showcasing several videos they claim show animal abuse at Excelsior Hog farm and they say, "by sponsoring Ribfest, Interior Savings is paying for these animal atrocities to take place."</p>
      <p>The activists say they are escalating their tactics because they feel there other methods of protest have fallen on deaf ears.“We have protested, written e-mails, held demonstrations, and so much more. This has been ongoing for many years now, yet our concerns have been laughed off, by not only the organizers of RibFest, but also the sponsors of the event, such as Interior Savings.”</p>

        <b>ORIGINAL 7:54 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Environmental and animal rights activists have locked themselves down outside the Interior Savings Credit Union in downtown Kelowna.</p>
      <p>Early Monday morning, a group of activists locked themselves to the two front entrances of Interior Savings Credit Union on Bernard Avenue, downtown Kelowna. This lockdown has prevented Interior Savings from opening, while more activists arrived to protest outside of the financial institution. The activists are holding signs saying, “Stop Sponsoring Ribfest” and the activists say that they will stay locked down until Interior Savings meets their demand.</p>
      <p>Castanet is there and will be broadcasting live throughout the demonstration.</p>
