      <p>REGINA -- Zach Collaros is happy to ride the whirlwind.</p>
      <p>A Winnipeg Blue Bomber for less than six weeks, the quarterback helped his new team to a 20-13 win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Sunday's West final and to a berth in the Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>The Bombers, who finished third in the West with an 11-7 record, take on the East Division's Hamilton Tiger-Cats (15-3) in next Sunday's Grey Cup game in Calgary.</p>
      <p>The Ticats downed the Edmonton Eskimos 36-16 in Sunday's East final.</p>
      <p>Collaros started the season a Roughrider, but was traded twice and landed in Winnipeg on Oct. 9 via the Toronto Argonauts.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old pivot experienced the Grey Cup in 2012 as a rookie backup for the Argos, who hoisted the trophy that year.</p>
      <p>Collaros was Hamilton's starter in the 2014 Grey Cup when his Ticats were beaten by the Calgary Stampeders. Five years later, he'll experience the CFL's championship game again.</p>
      <p>"My first three years you know you're thinking 'I'm going to do this every year, or every other year,"' Collaros said after Sunday's win.</p>
      <p>"Not everybody gets to do that. It's a precious thing and you've really got to cherish it. It's not easy to do. It's hard to put into words, but it's a really exciting feeling."</p>
      <p>In his third straight start as a Bomber, Collaros completed 17 of 25 passes for 267 yards and a touchdown throw to Kenny Lawler.</p>
      <p>He engineered a pivotal first-quarter drive to score the only touchdown of the game.</p>
      <p>From their own three-yard line, the Bombers raced downfield on a three-play, 107-yard scoring drive that included Collaros's 63-yard pass to Darvin Adams and his 26-yard touchdown throw to Lawler in the end zone.</p>
      <p>Justin Medlock kicked field goals from 44, 43, 32 and 13 yards for the Bombers, who won a second straight playoff game on the road after going 3-6 away from IG Field in the regular season.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan's Brett Lauther kicked field goals from 12, 13, 33 and 42 yards in front of an announced sellout of 33,350 at Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders topped the West division with a 13-5 record, and thus had a bye week while the Bombers beat the Stampeders 35-14 in the division semifinal.</p>
      <p>But Saskatchewan starter Cody Fajardo played Sunday with what he revealed following the game to be a pair of torn oblique muscles.</p>
      <p>He couldn't run the football as aggressively as he had in a season of 611 rushing yards. Fajardo was 27-for-41 in passing for 366 yards and was intercepted once.</p>
      <p>Trailing by a converted touchdown in the fourth quarter, the Roughriders were on Winnipeg's doorstep three times and failed to produce a major.</p>
      <p>On a third-and-goal with four seconds left, Fajardo's pass to the end zone bounced off the crossbar.</p>
      <p>"I just told coach the crossbar is 80 per cent air and 20 per cent iron, and I hit it," Fajardo said.</p>
      <p>"It's a pretty sick feeling in my stomach. Just the fact the play didn't get to be played out. When you hit the crossbar, it's a dead ball. Felt like we had a guy open."</p>
      <p>Winnipeg's defence denied Fajardo on a one-yard plunging attempt for a touchdown with 2:37 remaining.</p>
      <p>Trailing 17-7 to start the fourth, the Roughriders had third-string quarterback Bryan Bennett under centre for a short-yardage scoring play. A miscommunication cost the hosts a touchdown.</p>
      <p>"As an offence we didn't deserve to win that game," Fajardo said. "We got down there inside the five I believe three times and didn't score a touchdown."</p>
      <p>Winnipeg last played in a Grey Cup in 2011 when the Bombers fell 34-23 to the host B.C. Lions.</p>
      <p>Blue Bomber fans haven't celebrated a Grey Cup win since 1990.</p>
      <p>"We're one step closer," Bombers head coach Mike O'Shea said. "I'm pretty sure they're not going to be satisfied nor will we, unless we handle our business."</p>
      <p>The one-two punch of Collaros and rushing quarterback Chris Streveler that was so effective in a semifinal win over Calgary was deployed less Sunday perhaps due to Streveler's injured foot.</p>
      <p>Streveler, who rushed for 82 yards and a touchdown against Calgary, threw one incomplete pass in his only appearance in the first half.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan's defence was ready for Streveler to run in the second half, holding him to 10 yards on four carries.</p>
      <p>But the Roughriders offence dashed the hopes of their fans with fourth-quarter near-misses.</p>
      <p>"Look at that finish. That game was wild at the end. I enjoyed every minute of that," O'Shea said. "If that film travelled across North America, how could anybody not love our game?</p>
      <p>"It's easy to believe in our guys. We're going to find a way to get it done. I know it was a crossbar and it's kind of anticlimactic really."</p>
      <p>After knocking off the 2018 Grey Cup champions and the West Division's top team in the playoffs, the Bombers need to win just one more game against a higher-ranked team to hoist the trophy at McMahon Stadium.</p>
      <p>"We've got to make sure we stick to our process and our preparation, try to avoid all the noise that a Grey Cup brings and think about this as just a football game and not the Grey Cup, which is tough to do," O'Shea said.</p>
