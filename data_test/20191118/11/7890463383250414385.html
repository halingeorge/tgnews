        <b><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/stadia/google-stadia-release-date-price-performance">Google Stadia</a> has added another 10 games to its lineup just moments prior to the cloud gaming service’s launch on November 19, 2019. Those users that manage to slide their pre-orders in early will be able to purchase titles such as Metro Exodus, Rage 2, Football Manager 2020, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood come launch day – and play Samurai Shodown for free.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Google has expanded its initial launch lineup from 12 games to 22 following its most recent announcement. The new titles are Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2, Farming Simulator 2019, Final Fantasy XV, Football Manager 2020, GRID, Metro Exodus, NBA 2K20, Rage 2, Trials Rising, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.</p>
      <p>Also announced by the search engine goliath was a new game to its Stadia Pro subscription, Samurai Shodown. This game was already announced for the service but has since been confirmed for all Stadia Pro users – which will be everyone with access to the service within the first three months, at least. Pro users will also gain free access to Destiny 2: The Collection, too.</p>
      <p>The launch lineup increase was announced by Phil Harrison, VP and GM of Stadia at Google, and follows some concerns from the community regarding the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/stadia/launch-titles">limited Stadia Store lineup first announced last week</a>.</p>
