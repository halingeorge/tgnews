      <p>Liverpool are in an extremely healthy position in the Premier League at present.</p>
      <p>The Reds are top of the table having taken 34 points from a possible 36.</p>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s men have flown out of the blocks and are currently eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea, who are in second and third respectively.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s main rivals Manchester City have slipped to fourth in the table following the Reds’ 3-1 win over them before the international break.</p>
      <p>The champions have provided a fairly weak defence of their title so far, and Lee Dixon has pointed to what he thinks is the main reason Liverpool have surged ahead.</p>

      <p>He said on The Season So Far (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/lee-dixon-explains-main-reason-20903491">Mirror</a>): “I’m trying to put it down to one thing, I would probably say [Aymeric] Laporte getting injured for me is the biggest factor.</p>
      <p>“I think he is a brilliant defender, I think he holds down that left-hand side of the defence, whoever is playing at left-back he can kind of control that side of the pitch and obviously his centre-half on the inside. So that’s a big area of pitch to replace somebody.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – The biggest of many problems</h3>
      <p>Losing Leroy Sane at the very beginning has hit City hard, but Laporte’s absence has been massive.</p>

      <p>It’s as Dixon says – the Frenchman is a brilliant defender, something that can easily get lost as a result of his abilities as a ball-player.</p>
      <p>City are shipping goals in his absence, and it’s putting extra pressure on the forwards to bail the team out.</p>
      <p>With Vincent Kompany having departed, it was perhaps on Laporte to become the new force of the defence and injury has robbed him of that role.</p>
