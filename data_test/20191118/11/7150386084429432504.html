      <p>The Delhi Police issued the notice after vehicles on Nelson Mandela Marg, Aurobindo Marg and Baba Gang Nath Marg among other streets are moving at snail’s pace.</p>
      <p>Thousands of JNU students have flooded the streets of the capital city starting from the institute campus to the Parliament in a row over fee hike. Hundred of troops were deployed outside the JNU campus and Section 144 was imposed near the Parliament to prevent any incidents of violence.</p>
      <p>It must be noted that the march took place on November 18, the first day of the winter session of Parliament. The varsity students have been protesting for a complete rollback of the draft hostel manual which has provisions for the hostel fee hike, among other issues.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Education Secretary from the Ministry of Human Resource Department R Subrahmanyam said, “MHRD has appointed a high power committee for discussion with students and administration for peaceful resolution of all issues.” However, JNU students have claimed that they have not been informed about any such committee.</p>
      <p>The JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) has also expressed its concern over the present situation in the university campus.</p>
