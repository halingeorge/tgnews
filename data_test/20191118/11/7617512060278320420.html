      <p>The Monday morning commute from the Saanich Peninsula was longer than usual thanks to a crash involving several vehicles.</p>
      <p>Three vehicles were involved in the crash just after 8 a.m. in the southbound lane of the Patricia Bay Highway near Old East Road, north of Sayward Road.</p>
      <p>The collision “resulted in extensive damage,” said Sgt. Julie Fast of the Saanich Police Department. “There were, however, no reports of injuries.”</p>
      <p>The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but weather is not thought to be a factor.</p>
      <p>The crash caused southbound traffic to back up as vehicles moved slowly past the scene.</p>
      <p>Video shows a vehicle, its hood badly damaged, being removed from the scene on a flatbed tow truck.</p>
