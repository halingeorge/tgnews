      <h1>Russia gives ships back to Ukraine ahead of summit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:30:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Dmytro GORSHKOV (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>Russia on Monday handed over three navy ships it seized a year ago from Ukraine, Moscow and Kiev authorities said, in the latest move to ease tensions between the two countries ahead of a crucial summit.</p>
      <p>After an exchange of prisoners in September and the withdrawal of some frontline forces over the last few weeks, the handover marked another step in trying to resolve the five-year conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Efforts have been building since the election of Volodymyr Zelensky as Ukraine's new president, and on Friday France announced he would hold his first face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris on December 9.</p>
      <p>The talks, which will be mediated by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will be the highest-level negotiations on the conflict since 2016.</p>
      <p>Russia's foreign ministry said on Monday that the ships -- two gunboats and a tugboat -- had been handed over to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>It said they had "illegally crossed the Russian border" and been held as evidence but were no longer needed.</p>
      <p>Ukraine confirmed the handover of the "Nikopol", "Berdyansk" and "Yany Kapu" vessels.</p>
      <p>Ukraine's Navy said the ships "had begun moving towards mainland Ukraine".</p>
      <p>- France welcomes -</p>
      <p>Paris hailed the move, saying the step would help bolster mutual trust ahead of the summit.</p>
      <p>"The gesture was awaited and contributes to strengthening the trust in the dialogue between Russia and Ukraine," the French presidency said in a statement, following telephone talks between Macron and Putin.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian vessels were seized in November last year in the most serious confrontation between the two countries since the start of the conflict in 2014.</p>
      <p>Russian forces took control of the vessels as they headed through the Kerch Strait, a narrow waterway giving access to the Sea of Azov that is used by Ukraine and Russia.</p>
      <p>They captured 24 Ukrainian sailors, who were returned to Ukraine as part of the September prisoner swap.</p>
      <p>Television on Sunday showed footage of the ships being towed by the Russian coastguard through the Kerch Strait.</p>
      <p>Ukrainian officials did not specify when the ships were scheduled to arrive in Ukraine, but analysts predicted it might happen early Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The election of Zelensky, a television comedian who shocked the country's elites by winning the presidency in April, has raised hopes the conflict can finally be resolved.</p>
      <p>Zelensky has said ending the war -- which has left more than 13,000 dead -- is his top priority.</p>
      <p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed Monday the talks would go ahead on December 9 but appeared to downplay hopes of a major breakthrough, saying "we should not set expectations too high".</p>
      <p>- First talks in years -</p>
      <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he expected the summit to confirm "the inviolability and lack of alternative" to earlier peace accords.</p>
      <p>German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas is expected to arrive in Kiev Tuesday to help prepare the summit.</p>
      <p>In Berlin, a foreign ministry spokesman said that for the first time in a long time there has been "some movement" in the conflict.</p>
      <p>"We want to seize this momentum," he said.</p>
      <p>The four-way summit was initially announced by Macron for September, after talks with Putin in France, but was held up until the troop withdrawals took place.</p>

      <p>The structure for the talks is known as the "Normandy format" after a first meeting brought together the four heads of state in France's Normandy region in 2014.</p>
      <p>The last such meeting took place in Berlin in 2016.</p>
      <p>It aims to implement the "Minsk agreements", deals reached in 2014 and 2015 to end the conflict but which have yet to be properly put in place.</p>

      <p>The conflict in Ukraine's industrial east broke out after Russia's 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which led the West to impose wide-ranging sanctions on Moscow.</p>
      <p>The separatists have declared unrecognised breakaway statelets in the mainly Russian-speaking Ukrainian eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
      <p>Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Moscow of giving financial and military backing to separatists, which Russia denies.</p>
      <p>September's exchange was the first major step in years to reduce tensions, with the two countries swapping 70 prisoners.</p>
      <p>It was followed over the last few weeks by the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops and separatist forces from several flashpoint areas along the frontline.</p>
