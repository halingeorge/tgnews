      <p>Eight people perished Monday morning, while seven others sustained various degree of injuries as a petrol laden tanker with apparent brake failure rammed into other vehicles on its descent around the Felele axis of the Abuja-Lokoja highway, in Kogi State.</p>
      <p>The ghastly crash involving three cars, four tricycles, two motorcycles and a bus, resulted in angry youths taken over the expressway in protest.</p>
      <p>An eye witness who identified himself as Moses Johnson told our correspondent that the crash occurred around 8.45am, said that the driver of the trailer which was coming from the Lagos end of the highway lost control as a result of brake failure, leading to the death of innocent citizens who left their houses in search of their daily bread.</p>

      <p>Our correspondent who later visited the scene of the accident writes that the men of the Federal Fire Service drafted to Lokoja for the governorship election, were making concerted effort to put out the fire that had virtually taken over one section of the highway.</p>
      <p>Personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) were also seen on the ground, as they evacuated the victims, included the injured, and made to curtail the situation.</p>
      <p>One of the FRSC officials who declined to mention his name, attributed the accident to brake failure by the white coloured petrol tanker marked JEG141XA DAF, saying 17 people were involved in the accident</p>
      <p>He said that the victims have been taken to Federal Medical Central and the Specialist Hospital both in Lokoja by FRSC.</p>
