      <p>As the mayhem from Wagatha Christie dies down, Piers Morgan has revealed he pledged to help <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rebekah-vardy/">Rebekah Vardy</a> ‘fix her image’ following an epic falling out with Coleen Rooney.</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain presenter has spoken his word on the controversy of the year, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/wayne-rooney/">Wayne Rooney</a>’s wife claimed fellow WAG Becky – who is married to Jamie Vardy – was behind false stories about the Rooney clan in the media.</p>
      <p>While Rebekah fiercely disputed the accusations, Piers has now said he told the I’m A Celebrity star he was backing her in her big comeback.</p>
      <p>The jury is still out on whether ‘……Rebekah Vardy’s account’ is behind the leaks, but over the weekend Piers revealed he had attended a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/leicester-city-fc/">Leicester City</a> v <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> game and approached Becky about the controversy.</p>
      <p>‘I walked into the Vardy box at Leicester’s King Power Stadium, hugged Rebekah, now eight months pregnant with her fifth child, and announced: “I’m here to repair your public image!”’ he said in his latest<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-7684975/I-said-Rebekah-Vardy-Im-repair-public-image.html"> column for Event magazine</a>.</p>

      <p>‘”Oh Christ,” she chuckled, “that’s all I need…”.’</p>

      <p>The TV presenter refused to take sides in the fall out, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/piers-morgan-teams-rebekah-vardy-pokes-fun-coleen-rooney-wag-war-football-selfie-11073013/">despite snapping a selfie with Rebekah</a> in their box as they watched the game.</p>
      <p>Still, he added: ‘Whatever the truth, and Rebekah’s just as emphatic – and convincingly so – in private with her denials that she’s the leaker, Coleen’s decision to humiliate her friend at that stage of a pregnancy was very ill-advised.’</p>
      <p>He added Rebekah’s ‘disgusting abuse’ was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/robbie-williams-weighs-in-on-suicide-causing-coleen-rooney-and-rebekah-vardy-drama-11070356/">bad enough for singer Robbie Williams to chime in</a>, as he chided Coleen.</p>

      <p>It comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-fellow-wag-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-elaborate-plan-expose-10887652/">Coleen’s shocking revelation in October </a>that she had planted fake posts on her private Instagram story, which was only viewable by Rebekah Vardy’s account, to find out which of her friends had been selling stories on her to the press.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-hinted-10-months-ago-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-10888481/">Coleen had had her suspicions </a>about whether or not Becky was the one selling stories to the papers about her, and the pair had a bit of a run in months earlier after Coleen blocked her from social media.</p>
      <p>Rebekah has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/rebekah-vardy-slams-coleen-rooneys-claims-selling-stories-suggests-instagram-hacked-10887883/">denied she was the one behind the leak,</a> even ordering a forensic analysis of her Instagram account to clear her name, saying a number of people had access to her account.</p>
