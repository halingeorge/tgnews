      <p>On a day when President <b>Donald Trump</b> <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/trump-says-he-will-once-again-consider-answering-investigators-questions-in-writing/">floated the possibility of submitting written answers</a> to impeachment investigators, the House’s general counsel has revealed that lawmakers are investigating whether Trump lied to former Special Counsel <b>Robert Mueller</b> in written answers and perjured himself.</p>
      <p>The news came out in court, where the U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/appellate-court-to-hear-doj-arguments-against-releasing-mueller-grand-jury-materials-for-impeachment-inquiry/">is arguing against the release</a> of Mueller’s underlying grand jury materials and full report. House Democrats’ general counsel <b>Douglas Letter</b> asked a serious question in court to illustrate why lawmakers need the materials they are seeking.</p>
      <p>“Did the President lie? Was the President not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?” he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/house-investigating-trump-lying-to-mueller/index.html">asked</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump’s written answers were thrust back into the spotlight last week at the <b>Roger Stone</b> trial. Prosecutors said Stone lied to federal investigators to protect Trump, <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/breaking-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-all-criminal-counts/">and a jury convicted Stone on all seven criminal counts against him</a>.</p>
      <p>Witness testimony contradicted what Trump said in written answers about his phone conversations with Stone between June 1, 2016 and November 8, 2016.</p>
      <p>“I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>During his testimony, cooperating witness <b>Rick Gates</b> said he was in a car with then-candidate Trump while the latter was engaged in a phone call with Stone about those upcoming WikiLeaks disclosures. <a href="https://twitter.com/MMineiro_CNS/status/1194279230420459521?s=20">According to a substantially-redacted page from the Mueller Report</a>, Gates was in a Suburban with Trump on the way to New York City’s LaGuardia Airport sometime during “the late summer of 2016.”</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutor <b>Aaron Zelinsky</b>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/17/muellers-13-angry-democrats-where-are-they-now-1278231">a former member of Mueller’s team</a>, asked Gates what happened after Trump got off the line with Stone. Gates replied: “He indicated more information would be coming.” House investigators likely want to examine this testimony from Gates closely, as it is a direct contradiction of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/politics/trump-mueller-answers-wikileaks-trump-tower/index.html">Trump’s written testimony provided to Mueller in late 2018</a>.</p>
      <p>Mueller asked Trump several questions about Trump’s communications with Stone and Stone’s knowledge regarding “forthcoming releases of information” from Wikileaks. In response to that series of questions, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/trump-written-responses-to-special-counsel/index.html">Trump wrote that he didn’t recall any specifics of conversations he had with Stone from June 1, 2016 to November 8, 2016:</a></p>
      <blockquote>I spoke by telephone with Roger Stone from time to time during the campaign. I have no recollection of the specifics of any conversations I had with Mr. Stone between June 1, 2016 and November 8, 2016. I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him, nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign, although I was aware that WikiLeaks was the subject of media reporting and campaign-related discussion at the time.</blockquote>
