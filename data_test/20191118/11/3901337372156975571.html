      <p>The recent international break provided a trip down memory lane for Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane, who recalled his epic meet ups with football royalty such as Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Mosimane, who has been a hit on Twitter since joining the social media platform, has been keeping fans entertained with his hilarious memes and a behind-the-scenes look at the driving force behind Downs’ success.</p>

      <p>It was one such moment this weekend as Mosimane recalled the time he met Manchester City Guardiola, Ronald De Boer and former FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta.</p>
      <p>Although it is unclear where the meet up took place, Mosimane can be seen casually chatting away with De Boer and Guardiola respectively.</p>
      <p>One of the most decorated coaches to hail from the African continent, the former Bafana man certainly was not on unfamiliar territory.</p>

        <b>Do you think Pitso Mosimane is the greatest South African coach of all time?</b>
