      </figure>
      <p>Voters across the UK will elect a new Government on Thursday, December 12.</p>
      <p>The first December <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> since 1923 was called following a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/general-election-december-12-polls-17169315">historic vote</a> in the House of Commons in October.</p>
      <p>In the North East, 22 constituencies will be contested. These are the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/general-election-2019-seats-watch-17185384">key seats to watch</a> come election night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> will argue that Conservative governments have spent the past nine years cutting funding for the North East.</p>
      <p>But itâ€™s true that there are some marginal seats in the region that could change hands, many of them in Teesside.</p>
      <p>That includes seats the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservatives</a> could potentially take from Labour - and some that Labour has a chance of taking from the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Below is a list of every candidate standing in seats in Newcastle. If you're unsure which constituency you're in, see our <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/find-my-mp-constituency-election-13110501">guide here.</a></p>
