      <h3>SENATOR  Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa yesterday urged the immediate passage of a measure seeking to extend the validity of firearms registration which he said will be advantageous to all stakeholders, including the government.</h3>
      <p>Dela Rosa  said the proposed amendments to Republic Act No. 10591 or the “Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act of 2013” will ensure additional revenue for the government coffers.</p>
      <p>Dela Rosa pointed ou that Senate Bill No. 1155 or “An Act Fixing the Validity Period of the License to Own and Possess, Permit to Carry Outside of Residence or Place of Business and Registration of Firearms”  could effectively account for all loose firearms.</p>
      <p>“Dadami itong registered firearms na magiging under the control and regulation by the government,” said Dela Rosa, adding it will encourage more gun owners to renew their licenses.</p>
      <p>Dela Rosa, a former police chief, pointed out that the Philippine National Police has observed that a short validity of a gun license discouraged gun owners to renew registration considering the tedious process and documentation required.</p>
      <p>Liberalizing the process will motivate registration and increase revenues, he said.</p>
      <p>“We help them to become law abiding citizens,” he added.</p>
      <p>Dela Rosa, who chairs the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs, said under the proposed measure, firearms registration validity will become five (5) years from the previous four (4) years.  </p>
      <p>He said it is very practical to set a longer validity period that will be renewed at the same time with that of the License To Own and Possess Firearms (LTOPF).</p>
      <p>The renewal date is also set on the date of birth of the license holder,  an easy reminder on the part of the licensee.</p>
      <p>The amendment also seeks to extend the validity of the Permit To Carry Firearms from one year to two years.</p>
