      <p>MOSCOW, Nov 18 — Russia said today it had handed back three Ukrainian naval ships  seized off the Crimean coast a year ago, but Kiev did not immediately confirm the move.</p>
      <p>“On November 18 the handover took place to the Ukrainian side of three Ukraine naval ships that illegally crossed the Russian border in November 2018,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. </p>
      <p>However, Ukrainian Navy spokesman Oleg Chalyk told AFP: “We are not commenting at this stage.”</p>
      <p>In November 2018, Russian forces boarded and took control of the ships as they headed through the Kerch Strait, a narrow waterway leading to the Sea of Azov that is used by Ukraine and Russia.</p>
      <p>The seizure of the two gunboats and a tugboat was the most serious confrontation between the two countries since the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2014.</p>
      <p>Russia captured 24 Ukrainian sailors, who were returned to Ukraine as part of a prisoner swap in September.</p>
      <p>Border officials had said yesterday that the ships would be returned and local television showed footage of them being towed by the Russian coast guard through the Kerch Strait.</p>
      <p>The ships had been seized as “evidence,” Moscow said Monday, but added that the handover was possible because investigators no longer needed them.</p>
      <p>The Russian ministry maintained that Ukraine had committed a “crime” by ordering its sailors to carry out “provocative actions”.</p>
      <p>It added that it would continue to “harshly crack down on any provocations on its borders.” — AFP</p>
