      <p>Sara shares, “I may not be vocal about a specific political issue, but there are small things I feel I can do to make a difference. For instance, the entire Coolie No. 1 team has pledged to stop using single-use plastic on set. Of course, there are other changes I’d like to see set in motion.”</p>
      <p>Winning on both brands and movie front, the actress already has 11 brand endorsements in her kitty where the brands range from sports brands to jewellery brands which only goes on to speak volumes about how versatile ‘Buzz girl of Bollywood’ is!</p>
      <p>The actress will be next seen in the recently announced Imtiaz Ali ‘s next alongside Kartik Aaryan and with Varun Dhawan in ‘<i>Coolie No.1</i>‘, respectively. With a trail of promising projects, both the films are slated to release next year.</p>
