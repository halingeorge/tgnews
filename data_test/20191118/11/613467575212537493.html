      <h1>Ford’s Mustang Mach E is a valuable Tesla Model Y ally in the crossover segment</h1>

      <p>With Ford’s release of the Mustang Mach E all-electric crossover, it seems like Tesla is not alone anymore in its efforts at transitioning the mainstream auto market towards sustainability. The Mach E’s combination of price, performance, and range, not only makes it a legitimate and honest effort on Ford’s part, but it also makes the EV a serious threat to mainstream crossover SUVs. </p>
      <p>The Ford Mustang Mach E is an all-electric vehicle that will place it in the same segment as the upcoming Tesla Model Y. The two vehicles are priced in pretty much the same ballpark, with the Mach E’s standard range RWD version starting at around $43,900 in comparison to the Standard Range RWD Model Y’s $39,000. That’s a $4,900 difference, but Ford still has the full $7,500 tax credit, which makes the Mach E actually less expensive than the Model Y. </p>
      <p>Looking at the price and performance figures of the Mustang Mach E, it is evident that the vehicle is meant to be competitive. The entry-level “Select” variant, for one, will be offered at both RWD and AWD versions, and both will be equipped with a 75.7kWh “standard range” battery pack. The RWD variant will have a range of 230 miles and a 0-60 mph time of about 6-7 seconds, while the AWD version will have a range of 210 miles and be about a second quicker from 0-60. The Mach E Select variants will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/11/17/20967565/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-specs-price-la-auto-show-2019">shipping in Spring 2021</a>. </p>

      <p>Following the Select variants is the “Premium” trim, which starts at $50,600 and ships late 2020, just a few months later than the Model Y’s estimated Summer 2020 release. Premium Mach Es can be equipped with either a standard range pack or an extended range battery, and RWD or AWD. With this, a Premium Mach E could have a range anywhere between 210 miles per charge for the standard range AWD trim, all the way to 300 miles per charge for the extended range with RWD. AWD versions of the Mach E Premium trim can hit 60 mph in the over 5 seconds, while the RWD versions will hit highway speeds in the mid-6s. </p>
      <p>While this may seem like a lot of options already, there is still more. The “California Route 1” Mustang Mach E will be arriving in early 2021 for $52,400. This configuration is designed for long travel. As such, it is equipped with an extended range battery pack and 300 miles of range. A “First Edition” Mach E will also be offered in late 2020 with AWD and an extended range battery pack, which gives the vehicle 270 miles of range per charge. Finally, there’s the range-topping Mach E GT, which starts at $60,500, feature AWD, bigger motors, 235 miles of range, and a 0-60 mph time in the mid-3s. </p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-specs-batteries-range-price/">comparisons to the Model Y</a> will be unavoidable, it should be noted that the Ford Mustang Mach E is every bit more of a traditional crossover rival than it is a competitor for Tesla’s seven-seater. Both vehicles are aimed at the crossover SUV segment, after all, and that is a market that is so vast right now, it is practically impossible for a single automaker to dominate on its own. There is no question that the Model Y will sell in larger numbers than any of Tesla’s other cars — Elon Musk has said as much. But there is also no question that the Mach E, provided that Ford dealers do not nip the market’s enthusiasm in the bud, will be a huge success as well. </p>

      <p>This is something that Tesla CEO Elon Musk highlighted in a tweet following Ford’s reveal of the Mach E. While the American automaker was mum about Tesla’s contribution to electric vehicle design and innovation, Musk nevertheless credited the carmaker for its efforts at bringing about sustainable transportation. Ford, at least in its response to Musk, seemed eager to be on board the EV transition.</p>
      <p>And this is really the crux of the matter. The Mach E, at least specs-wise, is a serious electric car that is designed for serious users. Its Mustang name may be debated for years to come, but there is little doubt that Ford put a lot of effort into its all-electric crossover, and the results of these are far beyond that of any other legacy automaker so far. It could even be said that with the Mach E in the picture, <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-rival-jaguar-ipace-ownership-experience-buyers-remorse/">more expensive, similar-sized all-electric EVs</a> from other veteran automakers such as the Jaguar I-PACE are in for some tough competition. Companies with all-electric cars that are under-utilized and under-promoted like GM and its Chevy Bolt are also at risk of being considered as the final compliance cars of a bygone era.</p>
      <p>Ford has played its hand, and it did so with a strong statement in support of all-electric vehicles. With the Mach E, Tesla is no longer alone in the electric assault on the crossover segment. The question now is, will other automakers follow suit with similarly priced and specced vehicles? The next few years will definitely be very interesting.</p>
