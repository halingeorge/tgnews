      <p>TV personality Lorraine Kelly is known as a warm and welcoming character on morning television, but Jennifer Arcuri discovered the Scot can certainly dish out some harsh truths when she needs to.</p>
      <p>Appearing on <i>Good Morning Britain</i> Ms Arcuri, an American businesswoman, said she wanted to clear the air after hitting headlines over her "special relationship" to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p>But in a live link-up previewing <i>Lorraine</i>, which immediately follows <i>GMB</i>, the TV host took the opportunity to tell Ms Arcuri her appearance on the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV1</a> show had been pointless, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/lorraine-kelly-crashes-good-morning-17272724">reports Wales Online</a>.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old asked why she had bothered to come on to the show and say nothing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/lorraine-kelly">Lorraine</a> directly addressed her repeating, "What is the point you coming on and not saying anything?".</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri, looking confused, said: "I'm sorry?"</p>
      <p>Lorraine said: "What is the point of you coming on the TV to clear the air and then you don't say anything?"</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri replied: "I believe I said a few things. What is it that you are looking for that I say?"</p>
      <p>"You didn't answer any of the questions that were put to you and I don't see the point of you coming on to be honest," replied Lorraine. "Anyway, let me tell you what is coming on after half past."</p>

      <p>Ms Arcuri's links with Mr Johnson came under public scrutiny earlier this year over allegations she received favourable treatment for her business ventures during his eight-year stint as Mayor of London.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/piers-morgan">Piers Morgan</a> and Susanna Reid about their relationship, she called it "very special" but she refused to say whether they had an affair.</p>
      <p>Asked directly on ITV's <i>Good Morning Britain</i> programme "was it an affair", Ms Arcuri said: "I'm not going to answer that question, but as you can tell there was a very special relationship there and when it did come out, half the people already assumed the affair and told me to admit. The other half just wanted me to deny, deny, deny."</p>
      <p>Earlier, the American businesswoman had said she had asked Boris Johnson to acknowledge the fact that she has "been made the collateral damage of his quest for greatness".</p>

      <p>Pushed on how many children Mr Johnson may have, Ms Arcuri said: "I think I have a vague idea. I asked him once."</p>
      <p>She added: "I asked him once if he had as many kids as Ken Livingstone, and he said no."</p>
      <p>Asked for more detail, Ms Arcuri continued: "Well, he had the four, and one with another woman."</p>
      <p>Asked whether the public should know these details of Mr Johnson's life, Ms Arcuri replied: "Sure, sure, it's part of what I would say, you know, would be becoming of his character."</p>
