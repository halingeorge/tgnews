      <h1>Bank groups sue Wash. state over tax increase</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:31:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author">RACHEL LA CORTE Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — Two bank association groups have sued the Washington Department of Revenue over a measure passed by the Legislature that will increase business taxes on large, out-of-state financial institutions.</p>
      <p>The Washington Bankers Association and American Bankers Association filed the lawsuit in King County Superior Court on Nov. 5.</p>
      <p>They want the court to invalidate House Bill 2167, which increases the business and occupation tax on financial institutions with an annual net income of at least $1 billion, which currently affects 20 institutions, all based outside of the state.</p>
      <p>The tax increase, which takes effect Jan. 1, was part of lawmakers’ two-year state budget plan and is expected to bring in about $133 million for the current budget cycle.</p>
      <p>The groups argue that the measure — expected to bring the state about $1 billion over the next decade — violates the state constitution and the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
      <p>The initial bill included only a vague title related to revenue and was then amended and fast-tracked in the final two days of the legislative session.</p>
      <p>The 16-page lawsuit argues that the bill “suffered from a flawed legislative process and created an unconstitutional differential tax rate for in-state and out-of-state financial institutions.”</p>
      <p>The groups say the fact that the content of the bill was not available until the last 48 hours of the session violates a section of the state constitution that requires legislation to be introduced at least 10 days before the adjournment of a legislative session.</p>
      <p>They also argue that the measure violates the U.S. Constitution by discriminating against out-of-state groups “while simultaneously providing a home-court advantage to local businesses.”</p>
      <p>Messages left with the bank groups were not immediately returned and officials with the Department of Revenue declined comment, citing the pending litigation.</p>
