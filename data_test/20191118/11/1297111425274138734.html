      <h1>Theatre Regina ramping up fundraising efforts to revitalize Regina Performing Arts Centre</h1>
      <h2>"Some of the big ticket items, like the piping, could become emergent items, which would shut things down."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:00:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/jackerman55" target="_blank">Jennifer Ackerman</a></address>
      <p>Thirty years ago, Theatre Regina bought a defunct church at 1077 Angus Street for $1 from the City of Regina.</p>
      <p>Since then, it has been lovingly transformed into the Regina Performing Arts Centre (RPAC) and become a mainstay for local artists and other community groups to share their work and missions.</p>
      <p>“Arts is a vital part of any community,” said Howard DeLong, director of Theatre Regina, which owns and operates RPAC. “It’s the essence of the community.”</p>
      <p>It’s why DeLong and the rest of the Theatre Regina team are embarking on a capital campaign to raise funds for the revitalization of the centre, starting with a gala on Nov. 30.</p>
      <p>DeLong says it’s not in danger of being shut down at the moment, but the building is in need of some TLC — from smaller projects like upgrading washrooms, ceiling tiles and exterior lighting, to important large projects like building a freight elevator to make the building accessible, repaving the parking lot and eventually replacing all the plumbing.</p>
      <p>“Some of the big ticket items, like the piping, could become emergent items, which would shut things down,” said DeLong.</p>
      <p>He said keeping the building in shape is important because they want to be able to continue providing local arts groups the support they need to do what they do.</p>
      <p>Theatre Regina focuses their support on community-based, not-for-profit visual and performing arts groups, such as painters, sculptors, potters, and theatre and dance groups. They also support for-profit organizations and the facility is available to rent for a variety of other uses such as weddings and flu-clinics.</p>
      <p>Fifty performing arts groups and 20 other groups have used the facility in the last five years for things like First Nation meetings, symposiums and other celebrations.</p>

      <p>About two-and-a-half years ago, they also added an art gallery. Theatre Regina, the Regina Art Collective, and the Sâkêwêwak Artists’ Collective partnered to transform the reception area of the centre into a permanent, year-round gallery called the Lobby Gallery.</p>
      <p>“It just adds an extra dimension of entertainment to the public and it also performs an important function for artists in the community,” said DeLong, adding it’s part of Theatre Regina’s mandate to support artists of all ethnicities.</p>
      <p>DeLong said they’ve been able to make good progress on some important upgrades totalling $500,000 over the past five years, thanks mostly to a generous corporate donation.</p>
      <p>Since then, he said corporations have changed their mandate to gear donations towards specific initiatives, such as health and education.</p>
      <p>“The one really big donation that we got, we wouldn’t get it today,” said DeLong.</p>
      <p>RPAC has received less than $5,000 in corporate donations over the past three years.</p>
      <p>The operational cost to run the Regina Performing Arts Center was $317,000 for the 2017-18 fiscal year. That includes maintenance and small repairs, but not capital replacement projects.</p>
      <p>RPAC gets operations and capital funding each year from the City of Regina. This year they received $17,000 for operations and $6,000 as part of a new initiatives capital grant, which they used to replace the theatre’s chairs. They also receive $30,000 to $40,000 through a lottery grant from the provincial government, which can go towards capital improvements.</p>
      <p>But with the freight elevator alone expected to cost approximately $300,000, DeLong says they are working hard to bring in more donations to eventually help cover costs of big ticket items not covered by their usual annual funding.</p>
      <p>Applying for grants and pushing for more donations from community members who come out to see shows at RPAC is part of Theatre Regina’s larger capital campaign. They plan to set aside money each year to help pay for larger capital projects in the future.</p>

      <p>DeLong hopes to raise $4,000 to $5,000 at the Nov. 30 gala. That money will go toward upgrading the facility’s bathrooms, including repairing stalls and replacing the flooring.</p>
      <p>“The importance of the building is also to offer people in the community the chance to perform and to grow and to gain friendships and a sense of community,” he said. “That’s all part of what art is.”</p>
      <p>The gala will include a 50/50 draw and a costume and props photo booth. Performers include Dance Plus/Glam Dance, Regina Summer Stage, Zabutnyy Dance Company, and AUUC Poltava Ensemble of Song, Music and Dance — all local groups who call the Regina Performing Arts Centre their home.</p>
      <p>Tickets are $30 each or $240 for a table of eight. They can be purchased in person at the Regina Performing Arts Centre box office (1077 Angus Street), by calling the box office at 306-779-2277 or online at <a href="http://www.reginapac.com/rpac-gala.html">www.reginapac.com.</a></p>
