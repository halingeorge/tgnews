      <h1>Sony TV UK announces launch of ‘The Chef’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:22:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:22</time> by <a rel="author">Raj Baddhan</a></address>
      <p>Sony Entertainment Television has announced the launch of its new UK series ‘The Chef’, a collaboration with Cobra Beer.</p>
      <p>The format will introduce Hersha Patel, an award-winning presenter/filmmaker who has featured on ITV and was nominated for a Fortnum and Mason Food and Drink Award for her debut podcast. Hersha is profiling twenty-six highly respected chefs, who are striving to keep the culinary authenticity alive, and host them in her intimate kitchen. The chefs will talk through their rich history, the inception of their greatest recipes and their running of the world’s most popular restaurants. This biographical styled show will give viewers an insight into these inspiring chefs and their respective restaurants across the UK, showcasing world cuisines including French, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Thai, Turkish and Lebanese.</p>
      <p>To give a first glimpse of the new show and celebrate their partnership, Sony TV and Cobra hosted a special preview in London to a handful of guests and gave them the chance to watch the official show teaser, meet the chefs involved and speak with the host Hersha Patel.</p>
      <p>Key speakers included, Lord Karan Bilimoria, Chairman of Cobra Beer Partnership, talking about their association with the series and Neeraj Arora, EVP Head of International Business, Sony Pictures Networks, followed by Q&amp;A with the audience.</p>
      <p>Lord Karan Bilimoria, Chairman of Cobra Beer Partnership said, “We at Cobra Beer are absolutely delighted to be the founder sponsors of Sony TV‘s The Chef series. Cobra started its journey in restaurants and restaurants will always be our foundation and our base – without the support of the restaurant industry Cobra would not be where it is today, a household name in the UK and sold in 40 countries around the world. Cobra was created to be the ideal accompaniment to all cuisine – “brewed smooth for all food.”</p>
      <p>He added, “Sony TV are the most prominent channel amongst the Asian community in Europe. They have been partners of ours over the years and we are so proud to be once again working with Sony to create this unique, special and inspirational show. My thanks go to everyone for all the effort they have put in to bring ‘The Chef’ to life – We are honored to champion the British restaurant industry, which is now respected around the world as being the finest, most creative and most innovative globally.”</p>
      <p>Neeraj Arora – EVP Head of International Business, Sony Pictures Networks commented, “It is wonderful to be able to partner with Cobra Beer on a project as exciting and different as this. ‘The Chef’ is one of those unique concepts which is not seen often, especially within the South Asian audience. It is not a cookery show which gives a set recipe for viewers at home to follow – instead it’s a show which gives an insight into the phenomenal dishes and the inspirational chefs behind each one along with an intimate view of the fine dining restaurants they run.</p>
      <p>Cobra have been wonderful partners to Sony over the past two decades now, with a great synergy of brands built upon excellence and the customer. I would like to thank everyone in the Cobra team as well as our production house, Planet Eat, for their contribution in supporting ‘The Chef’ and the full circle engagement which will follow. I am very proud of the show and hope that our viewers will enjoy watching it as much as we have all enjoyed making it for them.”</p>
      <p>‘The Chef’ presented by Cobra Beer will be premiering in the UK from Sunday 1st December 2019 at 18:00, with repeat airings every Friday at 17:30 and Saturday at 09:30.</p>
