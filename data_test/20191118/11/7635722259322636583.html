        <b>A Muslim woman from Dundalk has claimed Lisa Smith should 'not be allowed go back to a normal life' when she returns to Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ms Smith left three years ago to join the so-called Islamic State group in Syria.</p>
      <p>After being held in a camp on the Turkish / Syrian border with her two-year-old child, <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/speculation-mounts-lisa-smiths-return-ireland-next-week-926037">there is now speculation</a></b> she may be deported back to Ireland as soon as Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Carol Duffy of the Dundalk Muslim Community knew Lisa Smith before she left for Syria, and she spoke to Pat Kenny this morning.</p>
      <p>Ms Duffy said she's 'not happy' to hear about Lisa Smith's reported return, claiming she's "very nervous for the community at large".</p>
      <p>She claimed she doesn't believe Ms Smith is remorseful, and think she 'doesn't even care what she's done'.</p>
      <p>Ms Duffy argued: "She should not be allowed to roam the streets and go back and live a normal life.</p>
      <p>"She rejected this life, this country for something she said was Islamic.</p>
      <p>"Me and my husband and all my friends are practicing Muslims, and Ireland is the best place to be as a practicing Muslim... because you have nobody bothering you.</p>
      <blockquote>"There was no reason for her, as she says, to go and live an Islamic life somewhere else - there's nothing Islamic about them people."</blockquote>
      <h3>'We don't what that ideology there'</h3>
      <p>Ms Duffy questioned how we know Ms Smith still doesn't have the connections formed while abroad.</p>
      <p>She argued: "That ideology isn't going to leave her overnight... no matter what she says about her daughter, wanting her daughter to have an education... all of a sudden this country is good enough for her now.</p>
      <p>"Who does she know, and who is she still in contact with? Those contacts just don't go away... the ideology just doesn't go away.</p>
      <p>"She comes back here, and [authorities] could possibly make an example of her - I think they should.</p>
      <blockquote>"But at what cost - and how is it going to affect us in our community and, as well as that, to our reputation?"</blockquote>
      <p>Ms Duffy said she would be of the opinion that they should "chuck her out" if she comes to pray at the local mosque - but she said there's not much they can do if she is simply coming to worship.</p>
      <p>She added: "What we can do is not allow her to participate in anything that we have going on [such as] classes... not allow her come into the community centre and participate.</p>
      <p>"We don't want that ideology there - and all it takes is for one person to come in and ruin everything."</p>
