      <p>In the second half of this year, several Chinese manufacturers implemented the concept of a display with a high rounding angle (the so-called waterfall-screen). The advantage of this format is the visual effect of the complete absence of side frames. Samsung is already manufacturing this type of displays, this led to rumors that the next flagship of the brand, Galaxy S11, will finally change the edge-panel to a “waterfall” design. However, the famous source of leaks @UniverseIce reported that this will not happen.</p>
      <h3>Samsung will abandon the waterfall-screen in the Galaxy S11</h3>
      <p>According to the source, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> did test the Galaxy S11 with a waterfall screen, but at the quality control stage, it was decided to abandon this idea. The good news is that the smartphone will still get thinner frames than the Galaxy Note 10, which in turn made a leap against the background of the Galaxy S10. Also, the device should receive a high refresh rate. According to various sources, 90 or 120 Hz. An official presentation is expected in the second half of February next year.</p>

      <p>It is worth to mention that according to the latest information, the Samsung Galaxy S11 series will be available in three versions – Galaxy S11, Galaxy 11 Plus, and Galaxy S11e. It will still feature a Super AMOLED display, HDR10+ certification and Dynamic support. For the processor, it will have the new Exynos 9830 SoC and Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor. In addition, the new series will have 4G and 5G versions but the Galaxy S11e may only support 4G network.</p>
      <p>XDA developers found “108MP” in OneUI. This indicates that <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/16/samsung-galaxy-s11-latest-renders-and-speculations-to-use-a-spectrometer/">Samsung is developing a smartphone with a 108MP camera</a>. According to speculations, Samsung will probably use the 108MP on the Galaxy S11 series. However, there are also reports that it will add a spectrometer that can tell you the temperature and sugar content of food. The front camera may be a 10MP sensor.</p>
