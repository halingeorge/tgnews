      <h1>Man City have ‘positioned themselves’ to sign player – He’s waiting for club to agree fee</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:33:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona and Real Madrid are both interested in Fabian Ruiz, reports <a href="http://mundodeportivo.com/">Mundo Deportivo</a>.</p>
      <p>For some months the Catalan media have been kicking themselves on behalf of Barcelona, after the Camp Nou club failed on several occasions to take a chance and sign the player.</p>
      <p>Now he’s starting to fulfil his potential, what may have been a bargain transfer is likely to turn into a potentially very expensive deal.</p>
      <p>Like always happens when Spain’s big two are interested in a player, other clubs are being dragged in to add to the drama, and Manchester City are once again on the list.</p>
      <p>PSG are also thrown in and given it’s the usual suspects being mentioned, it’s hard to know whether the claims have any truth or it’s just transfer rumour painting-by-numbers.</p>
      <p>According to the Catalan newspaper, Manchester City have ‘positioned themselves’ to sign the Napoli midfielder.</p>
      <p>Fabian Ruiz has been ‘addressed’ by all the clubs mentioned, with it being claimed there’s been contact to find out what his preference would be.</p>

      <p>Unusually for a Catalan publication, Mundo Deportivo don’t claim the 23 year old would automatically pick Barcelona. Right now, he doesn’t have any preference among the four clubs and will instead wait for someone to agree a fee with Napoli.</p>
      <p>That would suggest Manchester City have a good chance, if their interest is as real as described.</p>
