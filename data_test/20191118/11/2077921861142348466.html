      <h1>Even North Korea Is Sick of Trump's Bragging</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:45:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ryan  </a></address>
      <p>This lede from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-envoy-russia/north-korea-says-no-more-talks-with-u-s-just-so-trump-can-brag-idUSKBN1XS0HN?il=0&amp;utm_source=reddit.com">Reuters</a> says quite a lot, and is secretly quite funny:</p>
      <p>North Korea said on Monday it was not interested in meaningless talks with the United States just so President <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a> had something to boast about, urging an end to what it called a policy of hostility if the United States wanted dialogue.</p>
      <p>That’s right—North Korea, a brutal dictatorship based in large part on a scary cult of personality, whose entire diplomatic strategy rests on brinkmanship, empty threats, and terrifying missile launches, is sick and tired of talking with the American blowhard just so he can tweet about it.</p>
      <p>This all came from Kim Kye Gwan, a senior official who was reacting to this tweet from Trump, which followed <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/North+Korea">North Korea</a> calling Joe Biden a “rabid dog” who should be “beaten to death with a stick” (you really can’t make this shit up):</p>

      <p>Kim said nothing had changed, and that “we are no longer interested in such talks that bring nothing to us.”</p>
      <p>And the money quote:</p>
      <p>“As we have got nothing in return, we will no longer gift the U.S. president with something he can boast of, but get compensation for the successes that President Trump is proud of as his administrative achievements,” Kim said.</p>
      <p>A clear indication that despite previous boasts, and despite meetings—pardon me, <i>summits</i>—that felt at least a little historic at the time, there has been no real progress made. Expect a return to “Rocket Man”-style tweeting soon.</p>
