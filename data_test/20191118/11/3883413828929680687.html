      <p>The leader of North Korea has overseen an airbourne military exercise and vowed to build an "invincible army" - despite diplomatic efforts from the South and the US.</p>
      <p>Kim Jong Un's actions come alongside action taken by the US and South Korea to promote diplomacy around the North's nuclear capabilities.</p>
      <p>At an Asian defence ministers' conference in Bangkok yesterday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the United States has indefinitely postponed a joint military exercise with South Korea in an "act of goodwill" towards North Korea.</p>

      <p>Talks of another summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un were also sparked by Mr Trump's on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"I am the only one who can get you where you have to be," he wrote.</p>
      <p>"You should act quickly, get the deal done. See you soon!"</p>
      <p>North Korea has now publicised two military drills in three days - a report detailing how Mr Kim urged combat pilots to prepare against enemies "armed to the teeth" while attending a flight demonstration.</p>
      <p>He also said it is "necessary to wage a drill without notice under the simulated conditions of real war" - planning to build his forces into an"invincible army", according to The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).</p>

      <p>US efforts to facilitate the denuclearisation of North Korea faltered alongside negotiations, after a <a href="https://www.forces.net/world/sometimes-you-have-walk-trump-kim-summit-ends-without-nuclear-deal">failed second summit in February</a>.</p>
      <p>The US rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.</p>
      <p>Mr Kim issued an end-of-year deadline for the Trump administration to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal.</p>
      <p>Recent months have seen a <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/north-korea-fires-projectile-scheduled-us-talks">flurry of projectile test-launches from North Korea</a> - one reportedly <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/pyongyang-confirms-new-submarine-launched-missile-test">fired from underwater</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite the breakdown in talks, Donald Trump did make an <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/donald-trump-takes-first-steps-north-korea-during-meeting-kim-jong-un">unprecedented visit to North Korea</a> in June.</p>
