      <h1>Kpando Municipal Assembly fails to meet revenue target</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:00:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ebenezer Sowah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Kpando (V/R), Nov. 18, GNA - The Kpando Municipal Assembly in the Volta Region has failed to meet its 2019 Internally Generated Fund (IGF) revenue target of GH¢613,750.00.</p>
      <p>Mr Eric Botchway, Municipal Finance Officer said the Assembly only realised GH¢312,263.13 as at October 31, 2019, which was about 50.9 per cent of the total target.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Ghana News Agency (GNA) at the Municipality's version of the Meet the Press Series, he said most people were engaged in petty trading, which fetched the Assembly "peanuts", coupled with some individuals under declaring their goods.</p>
      <p>Mr. Botchway added that the performance expenditure of the Assembly for the same period was GH¢296,361.43, which represented 46.4 per cent of the IGF.</p>
      <p>He said the total revenue mobilised by the Assembly from all sources amounted to GH¢3,445,594.90 out of the GH¢7,129,741.20 projected.</p>
      <p>Mr. Botchway said though the Assembly could not meet its intended target for the year under review, he was proud of the staff for employing effective financial control practices in the discharge of their duties during the period.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ernest Theophilus Quist, Municipal Chief Executive said it was unfortunate that a Municipality that had two huge markets would realise such a meagre revenue.</p>
      <p>He said the Assembly's revenue collection task force needed to put in more effort to rake in enough revenue to support the Government's initiatives to address their numerous developmental challenges.</p>
      <p>Mr. Quist urged people in the Municipality to lend their support to the Assembly in giving them a facelift through revenue mobilisation.</p>
