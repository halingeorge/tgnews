      <p>Christmas might be 36 days away, but Friends fans are already getting lots of presents from Santa.</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/friends-reunion-show-happening-cast-involved-11088987/">Hollywood Reporter reported that a reunion might finally be on the cards</a>, courtesy of HBO Max, and now Aldi has released a brand new collection of interior products themed after the popular show.</p>
      <p>Add some Friends touches throughout your home by decorating it with three duvet set designs, as well as cups, mugs and three types of pillows.</p>
      <p>Remember that episode where Phoebe tries to seduce Chandler in order to get him to admit that he’s sleeping with Monica?</p>
      <p>Hardcore fans will recognise the line ‘They don’t know that we know they know we know’, scribbled onto one of the cushions.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, you can cosy up in bed with your very own Friends duvet set – designed in a pattern that features the show’s logo – or get yourself some Central Perk merchandise.</p>

      <p>There’s a cute cup, as well as a pillow, but no Gunther references, sadly.</p>

      <p>In addition to bedroom products, the collection also includes two pyjama sets – perfect to wear during a binge-watch.</p>
      <p>It includes a white t-shirt with the words ‘I’d rather be watching Friends’ on it, paired with cosy grey bottoms decorated with the logo.</p>
      <p>Then all you need is a cheesy pizza, a meaty sandwich with pickles (Joey would be proud) and five pals, and you’ve got your very own Friends flat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/search?text=friends&amp;category=specialbuys">The limited-edition collection</a> will launch on 21 November, but if you can’t wait until then, there’s also the option to pre-order it now.</p>

      <p>‘Take a trip down memory lane with Aldi’s gifting range that pays homage to one of the most iconic 90s tv series,’ the supermarket said.</p>
      <p>‘They’re also the perfect stocking filler or secret Santa gift.’</p>
      <p>If you’re planning to travel this Christmas, it might be worth swinging by B&amp;M as well, to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/05/bm-launches-new-friends-collection-with-prices-starting-at-just-4-10692137/">pick up a Friends travel mug and a hairbrush</a> (to avoid the Monica ‘humidity hair’).</p>
