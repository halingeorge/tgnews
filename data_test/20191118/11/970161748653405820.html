      <p>Labour has pledged to increase minimum wage to £10-a-hour which they claim would give people an immediate £6,000 pay rise.</p>
      <p>The party claims its ‘real’ living wage for all workers over 16 will give approximately 7.5 million people a pay rise, including more than 1.2 million young people.</p>
      <p>Workers who currently earn the national minimum wage would get a rise of at least £9,000 more by 2024 than under the Tories, Labour claims.</p>
      <p>The party says workers would get an immediate pay rise of between £3,444 and £5,986 under the party’s plans if they win the election on 12 December.</p>
      <p>The current minimum wage for people 25 and over is £8.21, while for 16 to 17-year-olds it is £4.35.</p>
      <p>Labour says workers aged 25 and over will get an average pay rise of £3,444, while 16 to 18-year-olds will get an average pay rise of £3,497.</p>

      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ‘Labour’s Real Living Wage will put more money into the pockets of the workers that need it most and give a boost to the economy.</p>
      <p>‘Over the last decade, the Tories have allowed in-work poverty to soar and left millions in insecure jobs.</p>
      <p>‘Labour will deliver real change for the many, not the few.’</p>
      <p>But the Treasury said the party’s ‘spending splurge’ would ultimately hit workers with a hike in taxes.</p>
      <p>Rishi Sunak, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘Since 2010, under the Conservatives, the lowest paid workers have £4,500 more in their pockets thanks to increases in the living wage and tax cuts.</p>
      <p>‘Whilst we’ve been working to make sure you keep more of the money you earn, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour would take the equivalent of a month’s extra wages from you after hitting you with higher taxes to pay for their spending splurge.’</p>

      <p>Today, Mr Corbyn dismissed ‘nonsense’ claims he is ‘anti-business’ during a speech to the Confederations of British Industry (CBI).</p>
      <p>He said a Labour government would bring ‘more investment’ to businesses than they have ‘ever dreamt of’.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said: ‘It’s not anti-business to be against poverty pay.</p>

      <p>‘It’s not anti-business to say that the largest corporations should pay their taxes just as smaller companies do.</p>
      <p>‘And it’s not anti-business to want prosperity in every part of our country – not only in the financial centres of the City of London.</p>
      <p>‘I say this to business too: if a Labour government is elected on 12 December, you’re going to see more investment than you’ve ever dreamt of.</p>
      <p>‘You’re going to have the best educated workforce you could ever have hoped for, and you’re going to get the world-leading infrastructure, including full fibre broadband you’ve long, long demanded, year after year at these conferences.’</p>
