      <h1>Bears vs. Rams final score: Struggling Chicago benches Mitchell Trubisky in loss to LA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:55:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bernstein</a></address>
      <p>All that the Bears tried to dispel last year has bubbled back up during a disastrous 2019 season, and their misery continued in a17-7 loss Sunday night against the Rams.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky again looked like a bust, and he was benched late in the fourth quarter in favor of Chase Daniel <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mitchell-trubisky-injury-update-bears-qb-sore-hip/1xu2qo1htvntt19r9awiph4v0u">because of a sore hip</a>. The running game wasnowhere near good enough to pick up the offensive slack, averaging 3.1 yards per carry. KickerEddy Pineiro missed two more field-goal attempts.</p>
      <p>The Bears have been held under 20 points in threeof their past four contests. The Rams have held opponents below 20 points in four consecutive games.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Both teams were hopeful that they could make a late rally and return to the playoffs. Their upcoming schedules, though, aren't kind. That made Sunday night's tilt even more crucial.</p>
      <p>Chicago (4-6) still has to play Dallas, Green Bay, Kansas City and Minnesota, so the loss means the team is almost certainly out of contention. The main topic of discussion now will be whether it is done with Trubisky as its quarterback of the future. He went 24 of 43 passing withone touchdown and an interception before being replaced by Daniel. Nagy said Trubisky's hip was particularly cumbersome when he needed to rotate it. Injury or not, though, the quarterback looked about as helpless as he has all season.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles (6-4) still has to play Baltimore, Seattle, Dallas and San Francisco, but because the Rams took care of business against the Bears — albeit on ugly terms — they are now very much in the thick of the NFC wild-card race.</p>
      <p>Sean McVay's squad jumped ahead with a field goal and a Todd Gurley touchdown in the second quarter, then pulled away with a Malcolm Brown score near the end of regulation.</p>
