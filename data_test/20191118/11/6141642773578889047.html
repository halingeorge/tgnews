      <h2>JERSEY showed great spirit to book a spot in the quarter-finals of the FA Inter-League Cup on Saturday evening, despite falling behind late in the second half and playing almost the entirety of extra time with ten men.</h2>

      <p>Trailing 1-0 to a hard-working Amateur Football Combination side, and heading towards the final five minutes under the floodlights in Sutton, substitute Arthur Illingworth rose to get the faintest of touches on Sol Solomon’s cross and take the contest into an additional 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>Karl Hinds was shown red for a high arm just two minutes into the extra time, but when Jake Prince was fouled in the box up stepped central defender Luke Campbell to fire in a 113th-minute winner from the spot.</p>
      <p>‘There was so much tension,’ said Jersey Football Association Combination League manager Martin Cassidy.</p>
      <p>‘I’m just absolutely delighted because we’ve not had a lot of luck in competitions and things have gone against us. I have to say it wasn’t luck today though, it was just an outstanding performance by a group that did their Island proud and they were absolute warriors.</p>
      <p>‘Our experienced players really stepped up, our young players showed their hunger and I’m so happy for every single one of them.’</p>
      <p>The quarter-final draw is yet to be confirmed but the fixture must be played before the end of February 2020. The eventual competition winners will go on to represent England in the Uefa Regions’ Cup, an international tournament for amateur players from across Europe. Jersey last achieved that feat when they lifted the FA Inter-League Cup in 2012 and then travelled to San Marino under the guise of the Three Lions the following year.</p>
