      <p>“Accountability has been and will always remain our top priority. All state institutions are on the same page and want to see a stronger and prosperous Pakistan.”</p>
      <p>PM Imran said corruption was like a termite that eats away at and weakens the foundations of a country. “Sustainable progress can never be possible without improving and strengthening state institutions,” he said.</p>
      <p>The prime minister also hinted that some steps to provide relief to the general public would be revealed in the current month.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Talking tourism </b>
      </p>
      <p>PM Imran also held a meeting with Zulfiqar Bukhari, his special assistant for overseas Pakistanis who also serves as chairman of the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC).</p>
      <p>The prime minister was briefed on plans to increase cooperation with Malaysia and Qatar to promote tourism.</p>
      <p>He vowed to ensure that investors looking to help Pakistan develop its tourism sector would be facilitated in all matters. “The potential for tourism in Pakistan is second to none and we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to make Pakistan a hub of international tourism,” the PM told his special assistant.</p>
      <p>“We have managed to stabilise the security situation and must now focus on developing the required infrastructure.”</p>
