      <p>Despite playing 90 minutes in Barca's first six LaLiga matches of the 2019/20 campaign, Griezmann has played just two full games in the league since.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old is also yet to contribute to a single goal in four appearances in the UEFA Champions League for the Blaugrana, playing predominantly as a left-winger.</p>
      <p>With there being plenty of noise surrounding his lack of involvement, the Frenchman recently addressed his current club form.</p>

      <p>"This isn't the easiest place to play," he told <i>Telefoot.</i> Â </p>
      <p>"It's a new team, a different club compared to before. You have to always work, I'm proud of where I am.</p>
      <p>"Have faith in me and everything will go as it's supposed to. I have to earn the confidence of the team. I'm a player who thinks of the team, of how his teammates move on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"If I can score it's certainly better, but it's not my main objective."</p>
