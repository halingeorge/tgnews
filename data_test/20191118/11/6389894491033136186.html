      </p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p>The company, which supply technical products such as wiring and seals for the life sciences, said that profit rose 14 per cent to £97.2m, up from £84.9m in 2018.</p>
      <p>Revenue also grew 12 per cent to £544.7m from £485.1m last year, driven by a strong performance across healthcare divisions.</p>
      <p>Cash flow slipped 7 per cent to £56.5m, with net debt at £15.1m at the year end.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share and total dividend per share each saw double-digit growth, to 64.3p and 29p respectively.</p>
      <h3>Why it’s interesting</h3>
      <p>2019 was a record year for acquisitions for the company, which invested £78.3m in four new businesses.</p>
      <p>Diploma said that the growth in uncertainty in global industrial markets had resulted in a healthier pipeline of opportunities for such purchases.</p>
      <p>It added that the contribution from these acquisitions would offset the “moderately lower growth” the company expects to see in the current financial year.</p>
      <p>Diploma also said that its life sciences division had enjoyed a particularly strong year, driven by gains in Canada and Australia.</p>
      <h3>What Diploma said</h3>
      <p>Commenting on the results, Johnny Thomson, Diploma’s Chief Executive Officer said:</p>
      <p>“Diploma has delivered another strong set of results with double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the year. We were also delighted to welcome four new businesses into the group, all of which are strategically important and have exciting prospects.</p>

      <p>“The political and economic outlook remains uncertain, but I am confident our resilient business model will support a consistently strong performance again in the year ahead.</p>
      <p>We have also reviewed and refreshed our strategy since I joined. Our plans are about continuity, building on the strong foundations of our value-add distribution model, focusing on the development of the organisation’s capability and on significant growth opportunities in our core markets.”</p>
