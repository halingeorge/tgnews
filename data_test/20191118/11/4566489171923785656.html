      <h1>Myanmar artists given second jail term for insulting military</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:20:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>A group of Myanmar satirists on Monday racked up a second prison sentence for a performance that criticised the military, a decision the artists said showed the judges were "puppets" of the military.</p>
      <p>The group of seven, known as the Peacock Generation, were arrested after performing "Thangyat", a Myanmar art similar to slam poetry, in April.</p>
      <p>Wearing military uniforms, they mocked the army through their fusion of poetry, comedy and music.</p>
      <p>But the authorities were unamused and the troupe, held in prison for months already, are facing several cases.</p>
      <p>Six of the seven were on Monday jailed under Section 505(a) of the Penal Code.</p>
      <p>The law criminalises any intent to cause officers or soldiers "to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in their duties".</p>
      <p>"They are found guilty of being disrespectful towards the military. That is why they are sentenced to one year in prison," judge Mg Mg Thet told the packed Yangon courtroom.</p>
      <p>Despite the group's relief that at least one had escaped prison this time, the performers' anger at what they regard as injustice was palpable.</p>
      <p>"The judges are being used by the military as puppets to bully civilians," 21-year-old Kay Khaing Tun, one of those jailed, told journalists outside the courtroom.</p>
      <p>- 'Ludicrous' charges -</p>
      <p>This is the second conviction under the same law within weeks.</p>
      <p>In October, five of the group were handed down a one-year sentence at a different Yangon court.</p>
      <p>Due to a controversial quirk of Myanmar's judicial system, the group can face the same charges in different townships.</p>
      <p>Since the artists performed in various locations, they now face numerous cases.</p>
      <p>For posting photos and videos on Facebook, all the satirists also face charges under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunication Act for "online defamation", an offence that carries a maximum two-year sentence.</p>
      <p>All jail terms will be served concurrently but each will only start from the date of sentencing.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer San San Myint told AFP they planned to appeal to the President and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Bequelin from Amnesty International branded the trials as "ludicrous" and called for the convictions to be immediately quashed and all further charges dropped.</p>
      <p>They are "signs of a relentless assault on freedom of expression in Myanmar," he said.</p>
      <p>He also urged Suu Kyi's ruling party to use its majority in parliament to abolish the various "draconian" laws.</p>
      <p>Rights groups say more than 250 people faced criminal cases under laws restricting freedom of expression in the first six months of 2019 alone.</p>
      <p>The artform "Thangyat" used to be banned under military rule but has been allowed again since 2013 and is normally performed at Myanmar's New Year water festival in April.</p>
