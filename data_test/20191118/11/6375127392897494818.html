      <p>Danica said the rape occurred on November 16 in an abandoned house a few meters away from the suspects’ residence.</p>
      <p>Before the alleged gang rape, Danica had drinks with the suspects. When she was already drunk, the suspects brought her to an abandoned house, where they raped her.</p>
      <p>The victim managed to escape and reported the molestation to the police, who immediately conducted a follow-up operation that led to the arrest of the five.</p>
