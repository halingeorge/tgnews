      <h3>Lions, Knights clash for all the marbles.</h3>
      <p>SAN BEDA and Letran duke it out for one final time today in a NCAA men’s basketball championship showdown that has surpassed a lot of expectations before a crowd that’s expected to fill every nook and cranny of the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>In what expected to be a cakewalk for the four-peat seeking Red Lions has turned out to be a protracted battle as the Knights gave their bitter rivals everything they could handle in the series.</p>
      <p>Letran stole Game 1, 65-64, before San Beda extended its reign with a series-tying 79-76 victory, setting the stage for the 4 p.m. rubber match.</p>
      <p>The Lions are gunning for a record 23rd crown while the Knights are seeking to raise championship banner No. 18.</p>
      <p>This will be the fourth straight time that the San Beda-Letran Finals series went into distance.</p>
      <p>The Lions won the deciding games in 2012 and 2013, while the Knights emerged triumphant in 2015 in a classic Game 3 that went into overtime.</p>
      <p>Newly-minted MVP Calvin Oftana played the hero’s role Game 2, completing a three-point play to put San Beda up, 77-76, with 19.1 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Letran tried to complete and celebrate another storybook season, but Bonbon Batiller bungled the potential championship-clinching lay-up in the dwindling seconds.</p>
      <p>Clinching a morale-boosting win, coach Boyet Fernandez hopes his squad will use this to fuel the Lions in this no-tomorrow match and not give the Knights an inch.</p>
      <p>“I hope we sustain this one. Playing a tough team like Letran that will be hard for us but again I do thank my players, thank the Lord for this,” said Fernandez.</p>
      <p>The Lions got a huge break late in the game when Fran Yu, who is scintillating in the semifinals and in the championship round, suffered cramps.</p>
      <p>Expect Yu to be in better shape and help Letran regain the throne.</p>
      <p>“No one really expected us to be here and go toe-to-toe with them and also give them their first loss after 32 victories,” said Knights coach Bonnie Tan.</p>
      <p>San Beda and Lyceum of the Philippines University dispute the juniors title at 1 p.m.</p>
