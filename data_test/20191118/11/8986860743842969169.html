      <h1>Fantana spotted with her beautiful mum at 4syte MVA’s 2019</h1>

      <p>RuffTown music signee Fantana has finally been spotted with her rich politician mother at the 4Syte Music Video Awards 2019.</p>
      <p>Fantana’s mum who is identified as Mrs. Dorcas Nda-Affo Toffey according to the photos sighted is likely to be mistaken as a 16years old young lady judging from her looks.</p>
      <p>Judging from photo and video, we believe Fantana surely got some of her curves from her mum because her mum carried a lot of assets both in the front and at the back.</p>
      <p>See the photos below:</p>

      <p>Fantana’s mum who also happens to be her financier not long ago donated a brand new ambulance from her personal coffers worth GHC240,000 to the Half Assini government hospital in the Jomoro Municipality of the Western Region for emergency relief services.</p>
