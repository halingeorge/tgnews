      <h1>How To Display The Number Of Unread Gmail Messages You Have On The Tab Header</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/emily-price" target="_blank">Emily Price</a></address>
      <p>When you have a lot of unread email messages, there’s pretty much no point to seeing exactly how many of those messages you technically have to get through.</p>
      <p>If you’ve recently reached Inbox Zero; however, then seeing the number of new emails that have come in can be pretty helpful. For those folks, Gmail actually has a relatively underused feature built-in that will display your unread message number right in the tab header. It looks like this:</p>

      <p>With it, you can see that you have three new messages (or 100) to tend to at a glance without having to physically click over to the tab to see them.</p>
      <p>To enable it, go to the Settings menu within your Gmail account by clicking the gear icon in the top right corner. From there, click Settings and then select “Advanced” from the list of available options at the top of the next page.</p>
      <p>Toward the bottom of the Advanced settings, you’ll see the option for “Unread message icon.” Enable that to have your unread number appear on the tab header for Gmail going forward.</p>

      <p>And if you end up back at “Inbox 1 Million” and no longer want to use the feature, you can disable it whenever you want by following the same instructions and selecting “Disable” instead.</p>
