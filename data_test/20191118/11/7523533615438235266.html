      <h1>Kanye &amp; Kim are selling their ‘monastic’ Calabasas condo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:58:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author">The Spaces Team</a></address>
      <p>It seems a month barely goes by without <a href="https://thespaces.com/tag/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> and Kim Kardashian making a real estate deal – and their latest move is to offload Kim’s <a href="https://thespaces.com/tag/brutalism">brutalist</a>-inspired Calabasas condo by <a href="https://thespaces.com/tag/Vincent-Van-Duysen">Vincent Van Duysen</a>.</p>
      <p>The Belgian architect designed the 2,260 sq ft <a href="https://thespaces.com/kanye-kim-are-selling-their-monastic-calabasas-condo/%22https://thespaces.com/tag/california-property">California property</a> with clay-coloured concrete walls, neutral tones and wooden floorboards throughout. Its three bedrooms are en-suite, and there’s also a covered deck area off the main living space.</p>

      <p>Of course, the condo has attracted attention from the media, with magazines like<a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29776718/kim-kardashian-calabasas-condo-home-listing/"> <i>Cosmopolitan</i> </a>dubbing the <a href="https://thespaces.com/tag/los-angeles-property">Los Angeles bolthole</a> the place ‘where dreams go to die’. <i>Ouch.</i></p>
      <p>That statement seems a bit harsh, but perhaps the photographs don’t do the apartment many favours. However, its new owner will also get bespoke furniture, drapes, chandeliers and lighting fixtures all designed by Van Duysen.</p>
