      <p>A search is underway for a 17-year-old boy who vanished last night shortly after a concert in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Worried family members say Joe Hogg was last seen at around 11.30pm in a car park following former Liam Gallagher’s gig at the Utilita Arena.</p>
      <p>They say he had no shirt on at the time and does not have his phone or any money with him.</p>
      <p>Now Northumbria Police are asking for the public’s help to find Joe, who is believed to be from the Durham area.</p>
      <p>An appeal for help from Joe’s cousin retweeted by former Oasis frontman Gallagher to his 3.2 million followers.</p>
