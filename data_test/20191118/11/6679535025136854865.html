      <p>Market benchmark Sensex ended 72 points lower on November 18, tracking losses in HDFC Bank, RIL and TCS amid rising concerns over the economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>The 30-share index, which opened on a firm note, turned negative in afternoon session before ending 72.50 points, or 0.18%, down at 40,284.19.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty slipped 10.95 points, or 0.09%, to end at 11,884.50.</p>
      <p>Yes Bank was among the top losers in the Sensex pack, falling up to 4.08%, followed by Bajaj Auto, M&amp;M, Hero MotoCorp, HDFC Bank, ONGC and TCS which declined up to 2.05%.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, Sun Pharma, PowerGrid, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, SBI, Vedanta and Tata Motors rose up to 4.60%.</p>
      <p>Despite positive cues from global markets, sentiment in the domestic market was subdued on account of multiple reports suggesting that the pace of Indiaâ€™s economic growth may falter further, traders said.</p>
      <p>Bourses in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Shanghai settled on a positive note amid optimism about U.S.-China trade talks while those in Seoul ended in the red.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Indian rupee depreciated marginally to 71.79 against the U.S. dollar intra-day.</p>
