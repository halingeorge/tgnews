      <p>Disposal of pending cases, reinstatement of credibility and common man's faith in the judiciary are some of the expectations legal fraternity has from the newly sworn-in Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde.</p>
      <p>Former additional solicitor general (ASG), Vikas Singh, said new Chief Justice's priority should be to dispose of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pending-cases">pending cases </a>and restore the credibility of judiciary among the people.</p>
      <p>"Disposal of long-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pending-cases">pending cases </a>would, however, be a tough task for the new Chief Justice," Singh told ANI.</p>
      <p>Echoing similar sentiments, senior lawyer Geeta Luthra said that Chief Justice Bobde will have to take the "faith and beliefs of a common man into consideration".</p>
      <p>"Judiciary is doing well, but the newly appointed Chief Justice Bobde should now see how it can be done best. He should also consider disposing of pending cases," Luthra added.</p>
      <p>Former solicitor general (SG) Mohan Parasaran said that his expectations from the new Chief Justice would be to regulate the Public Interest Litigations. "All PILs should be regulated," Parasaran said.</p>
      <p>New CJI, Bobde, has succeeded Justice Ranjan Gogoi who retired on November 17 after remaining in office for over 13 months.</p>
      <p>Bobde was elevated as a judge of the Supreme Court of India on April 12, 2013. He will retire as CJI on April 23, 2021.</p>
