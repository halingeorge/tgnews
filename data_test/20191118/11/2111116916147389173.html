      <p>Can't wait until <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday UK</a> offers start rolling in? Amazon has kicked off its Countdown sale for those after some warm-up discounts ahead of the massive deals event – with prices already dropping on a variety of smart security cameras, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-instant-pot-pressure-cookers-slow-cookers">pressure cookers</a>, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> and wearables.</p>
      <p>It's a small offering to start, and we expect to see more eye-grabbing discounts in the coming days, but if you're after any of the security cameras or home appliances featured here – or the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/samsung-galaxy-buds">Samsung Galaxy Buds </a>– now may be the time to start shopping.</p>
      <p>Amazon's Black Friday Countdown sale will run until November 21, but that will lead straight into the full and official Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales from November 22 onwards. (There will be deals for a while, basically.)</p>
      <p>Ring has grappled with some security concerns of its own in recent months, with claims that smart doorbells <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/amazon-ring-doorbells-could-let-hackers-hijack-your-wi-fi">could be hacked over Wi-Fi</a>, or even that user video recordings <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/ring-employees-can-reportedly-access-customers-live-camera-feeds">were being accessed by Ring employees</a>. But it's not surprising to see the Amazon-owned company pushed in the sales by the online marketplace.</p>
      <p>If none of the deals below take your fancy, there are also plenty of other deals appearing across Amazon and other retails, and you can check them out in our <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/amazon-prime-day-2019-uk-everything-to-expect-in-the-deals-event-of-the-summer">Amazon Black Friday</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/currys-black-friday-deals-2019-what-to-expect-this-year">Currys Black Friday</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-at-aocom-what-to-expect-this-year">AO Black Friday</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/john-lewis-black-friday-deals-18-11">John Lewis Black Friday</a> guides.</p>
