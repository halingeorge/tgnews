        <b>Brace yourselves, HRVY mania is coming to a city near you as the popstar has announced a world tour for 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Million Ways singer is set to launch the tour in North American leg next March, which will see him perform shows in cities like Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston, before heading over to Europe in April.</p>
      <p>Shows on the European leg will include trips to Amsterdam and Cologne, while UK dates are set for Glasgow, London, Manchester, Birmingham and Dublin.</p>
      <p>Oh, and it gets better because that’s just ‘part one’ of the tour – part is expected to be announced in due course.</p>
      <p>Announcing the exciting news, HRVY told fans on Monday: ‘Yano I’ve wanted to announce this for such a long time now so here goes. WORLD TOUR.</p>
      <p>‘VIP tickets and pre sale tickets go on sale this Wednesday at 9am Local time. download my app “THE HRVY PASS” to get access to tickets before anyone else.’</p>

      <p>‘I have an app, a world tour coming, new music, even more new music, a merch store and christmas is soon, we thriving kids.’</p>
      <p>The excitement is real.</p>
      <p>We can only predict the scenes outside the venues after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/hrvys-personal-appearance-shopping-centre-shut-four-minutes-gets-mobbed-fans-11072695/">HRVY, 20, shut down Bluewater shopping centre</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The popstar was due to host a meet-and-greet at JD Sports but police ordered him to leave the venue for health and safety reasons after fans arrived at the centre in their droves.</p>

      <p>‘Your support means the absolute world but just keep that in mind.’</p>
