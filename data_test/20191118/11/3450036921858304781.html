      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the country has a “behavioral problem” as he called on both sides of the political spectrum to defuse the anger now swirling around political debates.</p>
      <p>Speaking in his home state of Kentucky, the Republican leader said Monday that the lack of civility is the country’s biggest problem. McConnell, a close ally of President Donald Trump, says the country needs to get back to debating issues without “getting angry and acting out.”</p>
      <p>Known for his hard-hitting campaign style, McConnell said campaigns are always “hot salsa” but governing doesn’t need to be that way. McConnell is seeking another Senate term in the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>McConnell later told reporters that his comments were motivated by last year’s acrimonious confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</p>
