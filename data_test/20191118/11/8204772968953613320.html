      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Judd+Trump">Judd Trump</a> produced a superb performance to retain his Northern Ireland Open crown with a 9-7 victory over Ronnie O’Sullivan at Belfast’s Waterfront Hall.</p>
      <p>The world champion hit four centuries as he repeated his 2018 win over O’Sullivan to secure his third ranking title of the season.</p>
      <p>Yet it was no cruise with O’Sullivan, in a high-quality encounter, refusing to let the near-faultless Trump power ahead.</p>
      <p>Five-time world champion O’Sullivan never led but repeatedly responded to Trump’s clearances with excellent breaks of his own.</p>
      <p>In the end, in a match where errors were few and far between, Trump had enough of an advantage to hold on and he secured his latest success with a break of 84.</p>
      <p>Trump said on Eurosport: “It’s obviously hard to defend any title but do it against Ronnie is amazing.</p>
      <p>“The game was free-flowing. He was scoring heavy, I was scoring heavy. I think it was good to watch.</p>
      <p>“It was important to get off to a good start against him. We’ve seen in the tournament everyone who falls behind gets steamrollered.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to play against Ronnie otherwise you lose. It’s quite simple. I’ve got to up my game to stand any chance.”</p>
      <p>Trump set the standard early, opening up a 2-0 lead with breaks of 68 and 56 before O’Sullivan responded with a brilliant 126.</p>
      <p>A run of 123 allowed Trump to restore a two-frame lead but O’Sullivan hit back with 88.</p>
      <p>Trump claimed the next two to move 5-2 ahead and may have fancied a maximum after potting 11 reds and 11 blacks in the seventh.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan took the last frame of the opening session and the first of the next to reduce the deficit but another century, 106, put Trump 6-4 ahead.</p>
      <p>The world champion again fell short of a maximum as he recorded 113 in the 11th frame but O’Sullivan kept himself in contention with 72 in the next and a 76 clearance cut the gap to 7-6.</p>
      <p>Trump responded to the pressure yet again to move within one of victory with a break of 124 but O’Sullivan was still not done, replying with a brilliant 135.</p>
      <p>Trump had to produce his best yet again and did so with another fluid break to clinch victory.</p>
      <p>“It was a good match, I think everyone must have enjoyed watching that,” said O’Sullivan.</p>
      <p>“I loved every minute of it and I enjoyed watching Judd playing some great shots.”</p>
