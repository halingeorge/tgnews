      <p>Testimony from 2012 has emerged suggesting that the Queen ‘does not sweat’ – as the fallout from her son <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>’s car crash television appearance continues.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Newsnight on Saturday – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">slated as ‘nuclear explosion level bad’</a> – The Duke of York <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-says-sex-claims-cant-true-cant-sweat-11170147/">claimed he was previously unable to perspire</a>.</p>
      <p>The suggestion has since been rebuffed by various medical experts, including <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrews-no-sweating-medical-condition-debunked-sceptical-dr-hilary-jones-11173740/">Dr Hilary Jones, who declared himself ‘sceptical at best’</a>.</p>
      <p>Yet newly-unearthed testimony suggests Prince Andrew’s apparent lack of sweating could run in the family.</p>
      <p>In 2012, the Queen’s dress designer, Stewart Parvin,<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/of-course-my-dear-the-queen-doesnt-sweat-nqsvkcmhzfc"> told the Sunday Times</a> that the monarch does not perspire.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘I’m always hot, the Queen is very lucky, she doesn’t crease her clothes.</p>

      <p>‘The clothes are always impeccable. But it is also that she doesn’t glow. If you are a cold person your clothes don’t crease.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-cant-prince-andrew-sweat-the-answer-is-anhidrosis-cld20rds0">The Times</a> has also reported that courtiers were stunned at the young Queen’s ability to remain fresh during the opening of the Ceylonese Parliament (in modern-day Sri Lanka).</p>
      <p>Some 60 years later, when temperatures topped 37C on a visit to Ground Zero, New York, she again appeared not to sweat.</p>
      <p>The Duke was responding to an allegation that he had sex with Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), when she was 17 – as questions around his relationship with disgraced billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein continued.</p>

      <p>He said the claim could not be true because of a ‘peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.’</p>
      <p>The Duke did not suggest that the condition was hereditary – but because of a war time incident.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply… it was almost impossible for me to sweat.’</p>
      <p>The interview with Emily Maitlis has caused shock waves nationwide, as the Prince also claimed he had been in a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/pizza-express-woking-flooded-fake-reviews-prince-andrew-interview-11169085/">‘Pizza Express in Woking’</a> at the time of the alleged meeting.</p>
