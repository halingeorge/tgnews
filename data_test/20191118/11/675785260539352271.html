      <h1>Cambodia to ban elephant rides at Angkor Wat and relocate animals to nearby forest</h1>
      <h2>Cambodia is banning elephant rides at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Siem Reap and the elephants are already gradually being relocated to a new home</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:00:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>Elephant rides have long been a tourist attraction at the Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap, Cambodia, but local authorities are bringing the practice to an end.</p>
      <p>The Elephant Management Association, in cooperation with the Apsara Authority, is banning the practice at the Angkor Wat temple complex and the new rules are set to kick off in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Local authorities announced earlier this year they would be banning the practice, but the process is already being put in place as the 14 elephants are already gradually being relocated to a nearby community forest where they will live out the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p>Long Kosal, a spokesperson for Apsara Authority, told <a href="https://www.khmertimeskh.com/660036/apsara-authority-moves-elephants-out-of-angkor-area/">Khmer Times</a> : "The elephant is a big animal, but it is also gentle and we don’t want to see the animals being used for tourism activities anymore. We want them to live in their natural surroundings."</p>

      <p>Animal rights groups have long fought to end the practice of elephant rides around the world, which they say often includes mistreatment of the creatures who have their spirits 'broken' as part of their training.</p>
      <p>PETA has previously argued that elephants used for rides at attractions around the world are beaten into submission and forced to perform tricks - in some cases they are also kept in chains.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the case of Sambo the elephant at Angkor Wat made headlines around the world after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/elephant-collapses-dies-after-40-7827936">she collapsed and died</a> , having carried tourists in 40C heat.</p>
