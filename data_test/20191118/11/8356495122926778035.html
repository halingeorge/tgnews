    <meta property="og:description" content="Air New Zealand has cancelled some of its international flights due to ongoing issues with its Rolls-Royce engines. The national carrier says maintenance requirements has forced it to cancel some 82 flights, affecting 14,000 customers travelling between 10 December and 5 January. Most of the cancelled flights were between Christchurch and Perth, as well as Auckland and Sydney, with limited disruption between Auckland and Tonga. The airline said it would begin processing changes to customer bookings this week and then contact affected passengers. Air New Zealand spokersperson Dave Wilson said the airline had been performing regular checks on the engines since April and had been doing all it could to fast-track the required maintenance from Rolls-Royce, but there was a significant wait for repair services."/>
