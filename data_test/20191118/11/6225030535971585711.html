      <p>Storm the Court’s 45-1 upset win in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile has resulted in an open race for champion 2-year-old male honors, and among those looking to make a late-season push for the Eclipse Award is Sackatoga Stable’s <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Tiz_The_Law">Tiz the Law</a>.</p>
      <p>The Sackatoga Stable star on Sunday went through his penultimate work toward the Nov. 30 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Kentucky_Juvenile_Stakes_1">Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes</a></b> (G2) at Churchill Downs.</p>
      <p>Tiz the Law, winner of the Champagne Stakes (G1) in his last start, breezed five furlongs in 1:03.11 at Belmont Park. Despite the slow time, that was the sixth-fastest of 17 works at the distance over “Big Sandy.”</p>
      <p>Jack Knowlton, principal of Sackatoga Stable, said trainer Barclay Tagg and his team were happy with the drill.</p>
      <p>“With that track they haven’t been putting any water on it, so they told me it was a little powdery and we weren’t expecting a fast time,“ Knowlton said. “They don’t want the track to freeze and cause other problems. But he’s fit. He finished up strongly and galloped out the way we wanted him to. So all is good so far. We’ll keep our fingers crossed and hope we can keep it that way for the next couple of weeks.”</p>
      <p>Tiz the Law is on the short list of potential champion 2-year-olds with three graded stakes remaining this season for the division. Following the 1 1/16-mile Kentucky Jockey Club are the nine-furlong Remsen Stakes (G2) and 8.5-furlong Los Alamitos Futurity (G2) both contested Dec. 7.</p>
      <p>Knowlton acknowledged the potential to win the 2-year-old championship with Tiz the Law is an unexpected development after connections bypassed the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.</p>
      <p>“Obviously that wasn’t on our list of things that we anticipated could happen when we decided it was in our best interests to not go to the Breeders’ Cup,” Knowlton said. “But as they say, they have to run the races. That one the way it turned out, in our mind certainly should put us in the conversation if we can go down to Kentucky and win.</p>
      <p>"A Grade 1 win in the Champagne and then a Grade 2 down at Churchill, I would think that stacks up pretty well.”</p>
      <p>Tiz the Law will work once more at Belmont Park before shipping to Churchill Downs on Nov. 25, Knowlton said.</p>
      <p>Tiz the Law is a New York-bred son of red-hot freshman sire Constitution out of the graded-stakes winning Tiznow mare Tizfiz. He won on debut against Saratoga maidens on Aug. 8 and came right back to capture the Champagne at Belmont Park by four lengths on Oct. 5.</p>
      <p>The debut looks even strong in hindsight, as Dream Bigger, second that day, won Aqueduct's Notebook Stakes for state-bred 2-year-olds on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Knowlton signed the ticket to acquire Knowlton for $110,000 at last year's Fasig-Tipton Saratoga August sale for New York-breds.</p>
