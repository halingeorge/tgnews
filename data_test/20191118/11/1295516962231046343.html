      <h1>Disney+ Loki Series May Involve Female Version of the Marvel Villain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:11:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Arvedon</a></address>
      <p><i>Yesterday</i> star <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-loki-sophia-di-martino-co-star/">Sophia Di Martino</a>, who was reportedly in talks to join Marvel's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/loki-tv/"><i>Loki</i></a> series, has seemingly been confirmed to join Tom Hiddleston's God of Mischief on Disney+ in a major way.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/loki-sophia-di-martino-cast-tom-hiddleston-marvel-limited-series-disney-1202787710/">Deadline</a></i>, Di Martino will be a co-lead in the series and may even portray a female version of Loki.</p>

      <p>Aside from the possible inclusion of a female Loki, the series will also <a href="https://www.cbr.com/loki-tv-time-travel-component/">delve into time travel</a>. "There will be a man on the run quality to it, and we get the chance to explore the more human sides of Loki," executive producer Stephen Broussard said.</p>
      <p>Of course, a female Loki isn't the only swerve in terms of the eponymous character. At Comic-Con International in San Diego, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/loki-disney-plus-release-date-plot/">Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige</a> revealed the primary Loki of the Disney+ series is the same one that stole the Tesseract in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, prior to his redemption arc.</p>

      <p><i>Loki</i>, starring Tom Hiddleston, is set to hit Disney+ sometime in spring 2021. <i>Rick and Morty</i> writer Michael Waldron will write the series and be billed as creator, with <i>Sex Education</i>'s Kate Herron directing all the episodes.</p>
