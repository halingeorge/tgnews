      <p>Haim could sing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and it'd still be a bop.Â </p>
      <p>Which is probably why BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James asked the trio to turn listeners' songs into catchy songs.Â </p>
      <p>Take Autumn's story, for instance. This caller recounted a miserable ordeal to James â€” she ran out of petrol, her car broke down, and she had to ring up her dad Gareth to come rescue her. Enter Haim, songstresses extraordinaire, who turned this terrible anecdote into a hilariously dorky yet highly catchy song.Â </p>
      <p>"I'm driving in the roundabout, put my foot on the gas pedal, but nothing seems to come out, I'm not moving, not grooving," sang Este.Â </p>
