      <h1>Rhen's time to shine finally comes</h1>

      <h3>RHEN Escano confesses that there was a time when she was losing hope in her showbiz aspirations. “I started with Kuya Germs sa Walang Tulugan at karamihan ng kasabay ko roon, sumikat na like Ken Chan, Jak Roberto and Sanya Lopez, so parang naiinip ako,” she says.</h3>
      <p>But now, her big break has finally come. She plays the lead role of Ellen in the sapphic romance drama, “Adan”, which opens in theaters on Wednesday, and she will later also be seen as Xian Lim’s daring lover in “Untrue”.  </p>
      <p>In “Adan”, she has girl-to-girl love scenes with beauty queen Cindy Miranda. Didn’t she have any qualms doings this? “Siyempre pinag-isipan ko munang mabuti. When I accepted it, inihanda ko na ang sarili ko, mentally, physically and emotionally. Pero nangako naman si Direk Roman Perez na magiging tasteful at hindi malaswa ang treatment kaya I agreed to do it. I just think na lang na it’s not really me who’s doing it but the character I’m playing in ‘Adan’, which is very challenging. Yung character ko, si Ellen, simple girl lang siya sa probinsiya with a very  strict and controlling father, played by Bembol Roco. Dahil doon, nagrebelde siya. Hindi siya nakapag-aral but she is smart in many other ways. WIth the help of Cindy as Marian, we did something to my father to get rid of him. Nabigyan ng laya ang feelings namin sa isa’t isa, pero dito naman dumating si Epy Quizon as a police inspector na iniimbestigahan ang pagkawala ng father ko and I’m the primary suspect. Dito po naging thriller ang ‘Adan’ at very suspenseful siya hanggang sa ending.”</p>
      <p>How does she feel about same sex relationships? “I really have nothing against it, kasi tanggap na naman 'yan sa panahon natin ngayon. But ako mismo, hindi ko pa po na-try. Virgin po ako riyan. Ha ha ha!”</p>
      <p>She’s proud of the movie as press people who saw it in its special screening last Saturday at Gateway all liked it. “Nagustuhan naman nila at pinuri ang acting namin ni Cindy. Hindi lang naman kasi tungkol sa sex ang ‘Adan’ kundi may puso siya. Love story siya, nagkataon nga lang na parehong babae ang involved. Maganda ang mensahe tungkol sa pagmamahal ng dalawang tao who have the same sex. May torrid sexy scenes pero hindi naman bastos.”</p>
      <p>Also in the movie are Ruby Ruiz, Raffy Tejada, Phoebe Villamor and former Viva Hot Babe Maui Taylor who has done a movie similar to this before with Rica Peralejo, “Hibla”, directed by Yam Laranas who now wrote the story of “Adan” and also produced it for Viva Films and Aliud Productions.</p>
