      <p>LowSpecGamer has done wonders with Rockstar’s <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> now that it’s out on PC, going beyond simply sliding every visual option in the game to “lowest” to tinker with the game’s settings and messing with the way it loads its models.</p>
      <p>The results are a game that looks like the best-looking PC release of 1992</p>
