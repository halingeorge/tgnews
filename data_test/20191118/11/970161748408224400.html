      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! kicks off the really grim Bushtucker trials of the series tonight as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> are trapped in a box full of six-legged critters in Bugged Out.</p>
      <p>After almost being blown off a sky scraper before she’d even made it into the jungle last night, Good Morning Britain presenter Kate is having another nightmare as she goes up against the former Olympian.</p>
      <p>The rivals are hoping to win stars for their respective camps by dropping balls into moving holes while descending in the air with a swarm of cockroaches to keep them company.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn is impressively cool, calm and collected on one end of the spectrum while Kate, however, couldn’t be more hysterical without being actual Gillian McKeith.</p>

      <p>But who will come out on top?</p>
      <p>Last night ITV launched the 19th series of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! with what is without a doubt <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-2019-start-date-time-line-hosts-11167643/">the best line-up</a> in almost two decades of the show.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has already seen her odds slashed to become Queen of the Jungle after an impressive opening night, while she’s closely followed by Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson, who is hoping for ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-2019-myles-stephenson-caitlyn-jenner-second-chance-kendall-jenner-11174194/">a second chance’ with the superstar’ supermodel daughter, Kendall Jenner.</a> When was the first?</p>
      <p>And fans were delighted by the return of Ant McPartlin as he was reunited with Declan Donnelly after missing last year’s I’m A Celebrity while he continued his recovery following an arrest for drink-driving.</p>
      <p>The pair kicked off the night with a timely <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-dec-open-im-celebrity-hilarious-prince-andrew-sweat-dig-11172692/">dig at Prince Andrew</a> and his miraculous powers to swerve heavy sweating, which was just one of the extraordinary revelations to come from the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">royal’s car crash Newsnight interview on Saturday night.</a></p>
