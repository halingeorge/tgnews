      <p>Kicking off the Winter session of the Lok Sabha, multiple Opposition parties on Monday, have given Adjournment Motion Notice for various reasons. While the Trinamool Congress has given Adjournment Motion Notice in Lok Sabha over the detention of National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah,  Congress party has given  Adjournment Motion Notice in Lok Sabha over ‘Instability in J&amp;K post abrogation of Article 370’. Newly-joined Opposition party Shiv Sena has also given Adjournment Motion Notice in Lok Sabha over the loss of crops due to heavy rainfall in Maharashtra. Sources report that Sena supporters are also protesting outside the parliament over the farmer's distress while ruckus ensues in Lok Sabha.</p>

      <h4>'A high quality of debate is necessary': PM Modi</h4>
      <p>Meanwhile, appealing to all parties to debate freely on all issues, PM Narendra Modi addressed the press outside the Parliament ahead of the Winter session - the last session of the year. He highlighted the necessity of a high-quality debate in the House to contribute towards India's future. He requested all MPs to co-operate for a fruitful and historic session. </p>
      <blockquote>"We wish to have an open debate on all issues. A high quality of debate is necessary and I hope each one displays their intellectual prowess in contributing to the Parliament. The nectar which is created from this will help in progressing India towards a bright future," he said.</blockquote>
      <h4>Sena in Opposition</h4>
      <p>Shiv Sena MPs are being allotted seats on the opposition side in both houses of parliament as its minister has resigned and the party is "working out" alliance with the Congress and NCP to form government in Maharashtra, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said on Sunday. Arvind Sawant, the lone Sena minister in the Union council of ministers submitted his resignation last Monday. The party said on Saturday that it would not attend a meeting of NDA constituents on the eve of the winter session of Parliament. The decades-old alliance between the Shiv Sena and BJP turned sour after the former pressed for the demand of sharing the chief ministerial post in Maharashtra.</p>
