        <li>Israel Folau says the deaths of six people in wildfires across the Australia’s east coast are “God’s judgement” for the legalization of same-sex marriage and abortion.</li>
        <li>The 30-year-old, who was sacked by Rugby Australia in May for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-folau-barred-from-australian-rugby-homophobic-post-2019-5?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">making anti-gay comments on social media</a>, made the claim during a sermon at his local church on Saturday.</li>

        <li>At least six people have died and more than 300 homes have been destroyed in New South Wales, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50413869">according to the BBC,</a> but Folau says there is more to come.</li>

      <p>A former Australian rugby player says the deaths of six people in wildfires across the nation’s east coast are “God’s judgement” for the legalization of same-sex marriage and abortion.</p>
      <p>Israel Folau, who was sacked by Rugby Australia in May after saying <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-folau-barred-from-australian-rugby-homophobic-post-2019-5?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">“hell awaits” homosexuals on social media,</a> made the claim during a sermon at his local church on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“God’s word says for a man and a woman to be together, one man and one woman in the covenant of marriage to be together,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/592277641115135/videos/528446637884157/">the 30-year-old can be seen telling a crowd at the Truth of Jesus Christ Church, Sydney.</a></p>
      <p>“Abortion – it’s now okay to murder and kill unborn children and they deem that to be okay.</p>
      <p>“Look how rapid these bush fires, these droughts, all these things have come in a short period of time, do you think it’s a coincidence or not?</p>
      <p>“God is speaking to you guys – Australia, you need to repent and take these laws and turn it back into following what is right by God. What you see right now, it’s only a little taste of God’s judgement.”</p>

      <p>The fires in New South Wales have caused the deaths of at least six people, and have also destroyed over 300 homes across the state, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50413869">according to the BBC.</a></p>
      <p>A number of firefighters have also been injured, whilst schools, businesses, and hospitals have also been forced to close as firefighters continue to battle the estimated 85 fires, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/australia/live-news/australia-fires-live-nov-12-intl-hnk/index.html">half of which are out of control, according to CNN.</a></p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has slammed Folau for his “appallingly insensitive” remarks.</p>
      <p>“They were appalling comments,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pFv1k-mjqA">Morrison told 7News Australia.</a></p>
      <p>“He is a free citizen, he can say whatever he likes but that doesn’t mean he can’t have regard to the grievance [and] offence this would have caused to the people whose homes have burnt down, and for many Christians around Australia for whom that is not their view at all.”</p>
      <p>Folau is currently suing Rugby Australia for his dismissal earlier in the year, seeking $7.3 million ($10 million Australian dollars) in compensation for what he believes was wrongful discrimination over his religious beliefs, <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/israel-folau-condemned-for-labeling-australian-bushfires-a-taste-of-god-s-judgement-a4289341.html">according to the Evening Standard.</a></p>
