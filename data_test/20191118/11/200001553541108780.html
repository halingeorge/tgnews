      <h1>From Spain: Man United ‘strongest club’ in transfer race, pushing ahead for signing</h1>

      <p>Erling Braut Haaland to Manchester United is a rumour which ticks a lot of boxes.</p>
      <p>The Red Bull Salzburg player has worked under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer previously, with the manager helping the striker through when in charge of Molde.</p>
      <p>Scoring goals with ease in Austrian football, the 19 year old has replicated his form in the Champions League, which has seen interest grow around Europe.</p>
      <p>When the Manchester United links pop up, almost on a daily basis, there’s often a suggestion from some that the youngster wouldn’t sign for the club, given the football history of his father Alf-Inge Håland.</p>
      <p>According to the former Manchester City and Leeds United player, <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/alf-inge-haland-makes-clear-son-sign-man-united-leeds-united-man-city-history-not-issue/">that wouldn’t make a difference</a>, and a move to Old Trafford is certainly something which hasn’t been ruled out within the family.</p>
      <p>Last week we covered claims from the usually reserved Norwegian media, and it was stated Solskjaer has been taking steps for the signing.</p>
      <p>That followed claims from Italy, which have repeatedly stated Juventus, who have been credited with an interest, would be up against strong competition from the Premier League club.</p>

      <p>Now it’s the turn of Spain’s <a href="http://as.com/">AS</a>, and covering interest from Real Madrid, they state Manchester United are the ‘strongest club’ in the race for the player. AS make it clear that’s come from their own information, and it would add to a growing consensus the Red Devils have an advantage in this transfer battle.</p>
      <p>A potential fee is estimated at €100m.</p>
