      <h1>PS Now Competitor Google Stadia Nearly Doubles Its Launch Line-Up of Old Games</h1>
      <h2>Final Fantasy XV! Farming Simulator 2019!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/LiamCroft" target="_blank">Liam Croft</a></address>
      <p>Last week, Google announced that its <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/google_stadias_weak_launch_lineup_wont_have_ps_now_sweating_yet">Stadia streaming service would launch</a> tomorrow with just 12 old games -- all but one of which you've already played. It was a rather dire line-up, but overnight the company has gone and nearly doubled the number of titles you'll be able to purchase on launch day.</p>
      <p>Now made up of 22 games, you can look forward to streaming the likes of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/final_fantasy_xv">Final Fantasy XV</a>, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/metro_exodus">Metro: Exodus</a>, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/trials_rising">Trials Rising</a>, and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/wolfenstein_youngblood">Wolfenstein Youngblood</a> all on day one. With the new additions highlighted, the full list now consists of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>
          <b>Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2</b>

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rage 2</b>
        </li>
        <li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Samurai Shodown (available in Stadia Pro)</li>
        <li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Thumper</li>
        <li>Tomb Raider 2013</li>
        <li>
          <b>Trials Rising</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>A subscription to Stadia Pro will now even net users a copy of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/samurai_shodown">Samurai Shodown</a>, how lovely is that!? In all seriousness, this is quite obviously an improvement for anyone looking to dive straight into video game streaming before the year is out. Although, it still can't compare to the <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/guide_all_playstation_now_games">list of titles available on PlayStation Now</a>, can it?</p>
      <p>Some of these games were slated to arrive on Stadia before 2020, so it looks like a handful have been pushed forward to give users more choice on launch day. Could that create a bit of a drought in releases further down the line? We'll see.</p>
