      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 18 — Low interest rates will continue squeezing eurozone banks’ profitability in the foreseeable future, European Central Bank vice president Luis de Guindos said today.</p>
      <p>“The recent softening of the macroeconomic growth outlook and the associated low-for-longer interest rate environment are likely to weigh further on (banks’) profitability prospects, de Guindos said at a Frankfurt conference.</p>
      <p>Policymakers lowered a key interest rate further into negative territory in September, with -0.5 per cent on lenders’ deposits at the central bank — effectively charging banks to park their cash in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>In another move to stimulate lending, growth and inflation, the ECB also restarted its controversial “quantitative easing” bond-buying programme.</p>
      <p>“Market analysts are concerned about the drag on bank profitability” from such moves, de Guindos acknowledged, allowing they could eat into banks’ net interest margins — the difference between what they make from lending and the costs of refinancing.</p>
      <p>European and especially German banks have much lower profitability than competitors in the US, where rates are higher and regulations less onerous.</p>
      <p>But de Guindos argued eurozone lenders should do their homework by adjusting business models, cutting costs and investing in new technologies.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile “policymakers may need to remove obstacles to cross-border mergers and acquisitions... and pursue the banking union agenda” he said, repeating a long-standing ECB appeal to the European Commission in Brussels. — AFP</p>
