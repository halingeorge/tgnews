      <h1>365 tourists denied entry into Malaysia during airport operating system meltdown in August</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:04:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20KL" target="_blank">Coconuts KL</a></address>
      <p>Authorities today maintained before Parliament that the massive <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/system-of-a-still-down-klia-still-experiencing-technical-woes-expected-resolution-tomorrow/">system collapse that hit Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) this August</a> did not contribute to any security risks slipping into the country, saying some 365 foreign visitors were denied entry into the country during the days-long disruption.</p>
      <p>All 365 were given Not to Land (NTL) notices by the Immigration Department despite the technical crisis, which saw the total airport management system (TAMS) experience a complete breakdown, stranding travelers and grounding flights as KLIA scrambled to resolve the issue.</p>
      <p>Deputy Home Minister Mohd Azis Jamman addressed the August breakdown in greater detail than had previously been disclosed today, saying during a question-and-answer session in the <i>Dewan Rakyat</i> (lower house of Parliament) that national security was not compromised.</p>
      <p>Mohd Azis made the statements after being asked by an opposition MP how badly the incident had impacted the country’s tourism industry.</p>
      <p>Travelers trying to leave and arrive at KL’s two airport terminals, KLIA and klia2, saw their check-ins, baggage checks, payment portal terminals, and flight schedules severely disrupted during the incident, which that lasted from Aug. 21 to Aug. 25.</p>
      <p>Nearly 370,000 foreigners arrived at the city’s airports during the blackout, with nearly 350,000 managing to depart during the debacle.</p>
      <p>While several individuals connected to the airport’s tech support team were taken into police custody for questioning, no charges were ever brought over the meltdown, nor was it ever entirely explained.</p>
