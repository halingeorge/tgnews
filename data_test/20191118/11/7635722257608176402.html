        <b>Hobart Hurricanes player Emily Smith has been hit with a three-month suspension for posting a team line-up on her Instagram account before its official release.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cricket Australia imposed a one-year ban on Smith, with nine months suspended.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old broke Cricket Australia's Anti-Corruption Code by putting the team up on her official Instagram account an hour before it was permitted.</p>
      <p>The Hobart Hurricanes were due to face Sydney Thunder in the Women's Big Bash League but the match was abandoned due to bad weather.</p>
      <p>The match was a complete washout without a ball bowled and no coin toss possible.</p>
      <p>Smith has accepted the ban and will now miss the rest of this season'sÂ Women's Big Bash League and the Women's National Cricket League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cricket.com.au/news/emily-smith-banned-instagram-post-team-line-up-hobart-hurricanes-wbbl-wncl-season/2019-11-18">Article 2.3.2 of Cricket Australia's Anti-Corruption Code prohibits</a>: "Disclosing Inside Information to any person (with or without Reward) where the Participant knew or might reasonably have known that such disclosure might lead to the information being used in relation to Betting in relation to any Match or Event."</p>
      <p>Cricket Australia's Head of Integrity and Security Sean Carroll said while Smith did not intend to breach the code, players were well aware of their obligations.</p>
      <p>Carroll said: "CA's rigorous anti-corruption player education program means that players are well aware of their obligations under the Anti-Corruption Code and there is no excuse for breaches regardless of the reasons for information being disclosed.</p>
      <p>"Since the commencement of the Women's Big Bash League, Cricket Australia has had in place a robust anti-corruption program.</p>
      <p>"We have been working with Emily throughout the process and Emily now understands the mistake she made.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, in this instance Emily's actions breached the Anti-Corruption Code. We hope this serves as reminder to all that the Anti-Corruption Code is critical to protecting the integrity of the game."</p>
