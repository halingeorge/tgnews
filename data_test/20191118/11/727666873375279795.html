      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>While the NFL is still engulfed in the Colin Kaepernick controversy, the league is moving forward with its "Songs of the Season" series. Hip Hop artist<a href="https://smarturl.it/BlackSavages"> Royce da 5’9”’s “Black Savage”</a> is the latest track chosen for the Inspire Change initiative.</p>
      <p>“I’m honored to have ‘Black Savage’ be selected for Inspire Change and the Songs of the Season,” said Royce. “Music has always been a form of expression for me, so for someone to tell me my music inspires them, that means everything to me.”</p>
      <p>The NFL will use “Black Savage” throughout the season in broadcasts, pre-game shows, post-game highlights, and digital streaming platforms. All revenue generated from "Songs of the Season" will support NFL Inspire Change grant recipients with priority areas of education and economic advancement, police and community relations, and criminal justice reform.</p>
      <p>Royce's new record also serves as the lead single from the Detroit emcee's upcoming eighth solo studio album. His discography already consists of solo LPs like 2018's<i> Book of Ryan</i> as well as collaborative efforts from Bad Meets Evil, PRhyme, and<b> </b>Slaughterhouse.</p>
      <p>In September, SASH's “What Would a Champion Do?” was the first release as part of the NFL's "Songs of the Season." The <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/nfl-names-sash-s-what-would-a-champion-do-as-initial-inspire-change-song-of-the-season-v-CiU3F6ZU2iW-lMMxjdiA/">19-year-old New Yorker stated</a>, "I’ve been inspired by music all my life, and the reason I make music is to inspire others. Having the opportunity through Inspire Change to give back to the community with my music is a really special thing."</p>
