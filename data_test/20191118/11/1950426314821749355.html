      <p>Meanwhile, as Bloomberg notes, “Prince Andrew’s attempt to explain away his friendship with pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein in a high-profile TV interview <b>degenerated into a farce that threatens to be the British royal family’s biggest public relations disaster since its handling of the death of Princess Diana in 1997.</b>”</p>
      <p>* * *</p>
      <p>Last night, televisions showed the perfectly state-managed scene of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, sitting down BBC Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis conducting <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50431163">an interview</a> recorded at Buckingham Palace this past Thursday.</p>
      <p>In it, as <a href="https://21stcenturywire.com/2019/11/16/lawyer-claims-that-prince-andrews-bbc-interview-is-catastrophic-mistake/">21stCenturyWire.com reports,</a> <b>the Duke admits that he “let the side down” </b>by maintaining a friendship with jet-setting billionaire and convicted serial sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a grand mea culpa, Andrew concedes that it was not “becoming of a member of the Royal Family.”</p>
      <p><b>But far from repairing the PR damage done to Britain’s Royal Family, his move may have been a ‘catastrophic’ own-goal by his Palace handlers</b>.</p>

      <p>When asked why he stayed at the Epstein mansion after knowing he was already branded a convicted offender, the Prince answered simply,<i><b>“It was a convenient place to stay.”</b></i></p>
      <blockquote>“It was a convenient place to stay. I mean I’ve gone through this in my mind so many times. At the end of the day, <b>with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do.</b> “<b>But at the time I felt it was the honourable and right thing to do</b> and I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable but that’s just the way it is.”</blockquote>
      <p>Let that last statement sink in for just a few seconds…</p>

      <p>This, and other gaffs has led top media lawyer, Mark Stephens, who previously represented Princess Diana’s lover James Hewitt, to issue harsh skepticism as to whether this was a wise move to push Andrew back into the spotlight. He told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/top-lawyer-calls-prince-andrew-bbc-interview-catastrophic-error"><i>Guardian</i></a>:</p>
      <blockquote><i>“This strategy only works if you’ve got a complete and full answer to every possible question, and here<b> there are too many loose ends</b>.”</i> <i>“<b>If he’d kept his silence he’d have been able to remain outside of the case,</b> as he’s a witness and is entitled to diplomatic immunity. He was a private individual and now he’s waived that privacy.”</i></blockquote>
      <p>Entertainment PR agent Mark Borkowski, added:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Andrew has never enjoyed the company of journalists, and always kept the press firmly at arm’s length.<b> Doing something so public is a high-risk strategy, and likely just to draw more attention to the issue without changing any minds</b>.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>During the interview, the Duke of York was also asked about Virginia Giuffre, who was pictured with and claimed she had sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17-years-old.</p>
      <blockquote><i><b>“I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,”</b></i> said the Duke. “You don’t remember meeting her?” he was then asked. <i><b>“No,”</b></i> responded Prince Andrew.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>During his answer, the Duke blinked no less than 10 times in the space of just 10 seconds…</b>

      <p><b>He added that Ms Giuffre’s description of him “profusely sweating” was false </b>because, at the time, he had a medical condition that meant he could not sweat. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falkland’s War when I was shot at, and I simply …<b> it was almost impossible for me to sweat.</b> “And it’s only because I have done a number of things in the recent past that<b> I am starting to be able to do that again</b>.”​</blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p><b>The duke went on to question the validity of a photograph with his arm around Ms Giuffre in London</b> – saying it was not possible to prove if the image had, or had not, been faked. He said:</p>
      <blockquote><b>”I don’t believe it’s a picture of me in London because when I would out to… When I go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie.</b> “That’s what I would describe as… those are my travelling clothes if I’m going to go… If I’m going overseas.”</blockquote>
      <p>He added:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>”Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don’t recollect that photograph ever being taken.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On thing is certain: <i><b>the British public were not clamoring for Andrew to do this media spot, and quite possibly would’ve forgotten about it</b> as a hotly-contested UK General Election and Brexit begin to overtake all concerns heading into the Christmas season.</i></p>
      <p>So why do the Palace do it?</p>
