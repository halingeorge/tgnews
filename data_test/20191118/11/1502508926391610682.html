      <p>India's information technology services <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>may shed 30,000 to 40,000 middle-level employees this year as growth slows down, IT industry veteran T V <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mohandas-pai">Mohandas Pai </a>said Monday.</p>
      <p>The former Chief Financial Officer of IT major Infosys Ltd termed these job losses as once-in-five-years normal phenomenon with maturing of the industry.</p>
      <p>"As in all sectors in the West, in India too when a sector matures so many people will be there in the middle level who will not be adding value to the salary they get," Pai told PTI.</p>
      <p>Promotions are okay when <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>are growing fast but when it slows down, people getting fat salaries will aggregate at the higher level, prompting <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>to periodically reset their pyramids, and shedding people, he said.</p>
      <p>"It's going to happen again and again and again every five years," said Pai, Chairman of Aarin Capital and Manipal Global Education Services.</p>
      <p>"Nobody is entitled to a fat salary and high-paying job unless you perform, right? You have to deliver value".</p>
      <p>"All across industry, may be 30,000 to 40,000 in a year...," he said when asked about the number of middle-level staff who would lose their jobs.</p>
      <p>But Pai said about 80 per cent of those who lose jobs would have employment opportunities in industries in general if they are specialists.</p>
