      <p>TREMONT, Bronx (WABC) -- A livery cab driver is expected to turn himself in to police Monday for an attack in the Bronx.</p>
      <p>But the driver maintains he was the victim.</p>
      <p>Sandy de Jesus Rodriguez says he was defending himself when he pulled a knife on a fare.</p>
      <p>Surveillance video from October shows Rodriguez arguing with a man in the entry of a building in the 2300 block of Webster Avenue then pulling a knife.</p>
      <p>He claims the man's girlfriend skipped her fare and then stole $190 from him.</p>
      <p>When he tried to retrieve the money, Rodriguez claims, he was confronted by the woman's 21-year-old boyfriend.</p>
      <p>The boyfriend was stabbed during the incident.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the driver defended himself, saying the boyfriend was never stabbed in the first place.</p>
      <p>Police, however, say the victim was wounded in the torso and treated an area hospital.</p>
      <p>Rodriguez is expected to turn himself in Monday morning.</p>
