        <b>The trial into the attack in May 2018 at the training ground of Lisbon football club Sporting, whose 44 defendants include the then club president, Bruno de Carvalho, begins on Monday in the Court of Monsanto, Lisbon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The case belongs to the Court of Almada, but for logistics and security issues, it is taking place in Monsanto, in Lisbon, a judicial source told Lusa and will have as president of the collective of judges Silvia Pires.</p>
      <p>On 1 August the criminal investigation judge in the case, Carlos Delca, ruled that all 44 defendants should face trial on the exact terms of the charge sheet drawn up by public prosecutors led by Cândida Vilar.</p>
      <p>The decision followed the move by several defendants to request the opening of the instruction phase, in which a judge other than the one that oversaw the investigation must decide whether the case should go to trial and on what terms.</p>
      <p>Of the 44 accused, only Nuno Mendes, former leader of the Juventude Leonina claque (club fan group), commonly known as 'Mustafa', is still being held in prison on remand, while another 36 defendants are under house arrest, and after Elton Camará cut his ankle bracelet, the judge ordered pre-trial detention for him.</p>
      <p>Bruno de Carvalho, who until that day was subject to report to the authorities every day and pay bail of €70,000, is now required to present himself fortnightly.</p>
      <p>On 15 May 2018, Sporting players and coaching staff were attacked at the club's training ground and academy in Alcochete, in Setúbal district, by a group of hooded self-styled club supporters.</p>
      <p>The defendants who are believed to have taken a direct part in the assault face charges of terrorism (as defined in Portugal), the threat of violence, abduction, harm with violence, possession of a banned weapon and entering a place barred to the public.</p>
      <p>Bruno de Carvalho, Mendes and Bruno Jacinto, who at the time was the club’s official liaising with fan groups, are accused, as moral authors, of 40 crimes of serious threat and dozens of other crimes.</p>
      <p>Mendes also faces a charge of drug trafficking.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Cândida Vilar, who saw the prosecution of the Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed by the judge of criminal investigation Carlos Delca, said the then president of the club, Bruno de Carvalho, Mustafá and Bruno Jacinto were aware of the plan and 'did nothing' to prevent the attack.</p>
