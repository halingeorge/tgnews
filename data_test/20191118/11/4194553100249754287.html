      <h1>Glen Johnson: Trent Alexander-Arnold is Premier League’s best right-back ‘by miles’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:16:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Glen Johnson says that Trent Alexander-Arnold is the best right-back in the Premier League ‘by miles’ at the moment, claiming no one else comes close to the 21-year-old.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold has redefined what is expected from someone in his position and has really excelled over the last couple of seasons.</p>
      <p>Along with Andy Robertson on the other side of the pitch, he has made himself the key creative hub of Jurgen Klopp’s team, notching assists at a record rate.</p>
      <p>Asked by the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1204059/Liverpool-news-Trent-Alexander-Arnold-Aaron-Wan-Bissaka-Reece-James-Glen-Johnson">Daily Express</a> who the best right-back in the Premier League is, Johnson said: <b>“Trent Alexander-Arnold. By miles at the moment.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“Aaron Wan-Bissaka isn’t so much the modern full-back, he sometimes looks like a centre-half playing full-back. He’s a good defender but he’s not got the natural ability that Trent has got.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I know people speak very highly of Reece James at Chelsea. He wouldn’t be in the team if he wasn’t living up to his potential and I hear he’s a great lad as well.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Johnson did not even mention either of Manchester City’s two £50 million right-backs, Joao Cancelo and Kyle Walker. Alexander-Arnold is easily better than both of them right now which shows just how well he is doing.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold’s ability to create could well be needed against a resolute Crystal Palace side on Saturday afternoon. He might also have his hands full going the other way depending on where Wilfried Zaha is positioned.</p>
