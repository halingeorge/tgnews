      <h1>Disney is looking to strengthen its piracy fighting operation</h1>

        <b>Disney is looking to strengthen its ‘Piracy Intelligence’ team, presumably as part of </b>
        <b>an effort to tighten its grip on <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/disney-plus-release-date-price-shows-3694360">Disney Plus</a>’ content library</b>
        <b>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Disney Plus launched in the US, Canada and the Netherlands last week, and it will become available in Australia and New Zealand on November 19 − that’s this Tuesday. Unfortunately though, the streaming service won’t come to the UK and many, many other markets until 2020.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It’s inevitable that lots of Disney fans who are based in areas where Disney Plus isn’t yet available will, for the time being, pirate Disney Plus-exclusive shows like <i>The Mandalorian</i> and <i>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</i>.</p>
      <p>Not necessarily because they want to watch Disney Plus for free, but because this is currently the only way they can actually access it.</p>
      <p>Disney surely would have seen this coming and, just ahead of Disney Plus’ launch, it posted a job ad for a role in its Piracy Intelligence team (via <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/disneys-seeking-to-reinforce-its-piracy-intelligence-team-191117/">TorrentFreak</a>).</p>
      <p>“The Piracy Intelligence team at The Walt Disney Studios … provides meaningful piracy insights to inform strategies that maximize revenue for the film and TV business and minimize the piracy impact,” the <a href="https://careercenter.informs.org/jobs/13047167">job description</a> reads.</p>
      <p>“The Piracy Intelligence team is looking for a Market Research &amp; Data Analyst, who will be responsible for providing support to a variety of piracy intelligence initiatives to measure movie and TV viewing trends across digital media platforms.”</p>
      <p>And so on.</p>
      <p>With Disney Plus currently available in such few places, the Disney Piracy Intelligence team’s goal right now might not simply be case of stamping out piracy.</p>
      <p>As TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/netflix-sets-pricing-based-on-local-piracy-rates-150416/">reports</a>, in the past Netflix revealed that it uses piracy data to determine how much it should be charging customers, and what types of content various markets are most interested in.</p>
      <p>“Piracy is a governor in terms of our price in high piracy markets outside the US,” Netflix’s CFO David Wells said back in 2015. “We wouldn’t want to come out with a high price because there’s a lot of piracy, so we have to compete with that.”</p>

      <p>With Disney Plus piracy rates likely to be sky high in most of the world for the foreseeable future, the company shouldn’t be short of data.</p>
