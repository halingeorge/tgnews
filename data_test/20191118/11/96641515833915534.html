      <h1>Nintendo's snap-on Switch Lite case arrives in the US on December 8th</h1>
      <h2>It'll keep your handheld safe without much added bulk.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:03:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>There are already a number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/best-nintendo-switch-and-switch-lite-accessories/">good Switch Lite cases</a> available, but Nintendo might just have one more. The gaming giant has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191118005329/en/Nintendo-News%C2%A0Help-Protect-Screen-Nintendo-Switch-Lite/">revealed</a> that its previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/30/nintendo-switch-lite-snap-on-case-japan/">Japan-only</a> Flip Cover &amp; Screen Protector will be available in the US on December 8th for $40 through online stores, and at retail in early 2020. As you can see, the snap-on case focuses on safeguarding your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/19/nintendo-switch-lite-review/">Switch Lite</a> with a minimum of bulk. There aren't spaces for cartridges, power adapters or other accessories, but that might not matter if you either have spots for those in a bag or just want to keep your system safe.</p>
      <p>If there's a disappointment, it's that the case is only available in gray fabric. Your Switch's bright colors will be hidden until you're ready to play. It still beats having to endure a scratched screen or a scuffed casing, and the minimalism might be a positive if you don't room for much more than the Switch Lite itself.</p>
