      <h3>A THREE-DAY anti-criminality operation in the entire Central Luzon resulted in the arrest of nearly 600 law offenders, including 21 of the region’s most wanted persons, Police Regional Office 3 director Brig. Gen. Rhodel Sermonia told People’s Journal yesterday.</h3>
      <p>In a report to Philippine National Police OIC Lt. Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa, Sermonia said seized during the anti-crime sweeps were dozens of unlicensed firearms and other deadly weapons and illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Seventy-one members of the New People’s Army surrendered during the period.</p>
      <p>“This is in adherence to the marching order of Gen. Gamboa to intensify, reinvigorate and focus on the anti-criminality drive and anti-insurgency efforts of the PNP,” Sermonia said.</p>
      <p>The official credited their accomplishments to the strong support of all Central Luzon local chief executives, the Armed Forces and the Regional Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (RTF-ELCAC 3), which is composed of officials from the Department of Education, Department of Social Welfare and Development, National Intelligence Coordinating Agency and the National Economic and Development Authority.</p>
      <p>He said that during the 3-day period, 71 former NPA fighters surrendered to local police and government authorities. So far, 105 former NPA members in Central Luzon have returned to the fold of the law and availed themselves of the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP) for rebel returnees.  </p>
      <p>Sermonia said that he has ordered all PRO3 provincial directors and chiefs-of-police to conduct intensified Simultaneous Anti-Criminality Law Enforcement Operations (SACLEO) as part of the crime mitigation efforts of the PNP to deprive criminals with the opportunity to commit crime relative to the security coverage that it has laid for the upcoming 30th SEA Games.</p>
      <p>The top Central Luzon police official said that all security preparations for the 30th SEA Games are underway but still,  they need the public’s full support and cooperation.</p>
      <p>He also issued a warning to all criminals that the full arm of the law will be used against them should they still prefer to disrupt peace and order in the following days.</p>
      <p>Sermonia said that while simulation exercises are being done in various areas of engagement for the SEA Games, PNP units in Region 3 over the weekend have carried out actual and proactive crime prevention drive by accounting all wanted persons, clear the streets of drug personalities and take weapons and other instruments of violence from the hands of criminals before they can use them.</p>
      <p>As a result, he said that a total of 594 individuals, 158 of them with standing warrants of arrest for various criminal offenses, were arrested. Another 189 were arrested for illegal drugs and 247 for violation of other special laws and local ordinances.</p>
      <p>Sermonia said that of the total 594 arrested individuals, 113 were arrested in Pampanga, 91 in Bulacan, 90 in Nueva Ecija, 81 in Olongapo City, 69 in Tarlac, 46 in Bataan, 35 in Angeles City, 31 in Zambales and 13 in Aurora.</p>
      <p>Another  23  were arrested by members of the Regional Intelligence Division while two were apprehended by the Regional Highway Patrol Unit 3.</p>
      <p>The official said that out of the 158 wanted persons caught, 21 of them were listed as among the most dangerous wanted criminals in their respective areas.</p>
      <p>He  identified them as Joey Carza, ranked 9 and Annalyn Villarosa, ranked 8, both in the town of Pandi, Bulacan; Melody Naval ranked 9 in Balanga, Bataan; Errol Ferol, ranked 6 in Bacolor; Eugine Santos, ranked 9 in Candaba; Mark Anthony Padilla, ranked 6; Christine Evaristo, ranked 8; Dante Maniing, ranked 9 in Guagua;</p>
      <p>Renz Robert Gutierrez, ranked 7 in Lubao; Marvin Estrada, ranked 5; and Jhustine Duque, ranked 8 in City of San Fernando; Ramel Sunga, ranked 4 in Sasmuan; Fleshy Ponce, ranked 3 in Sta Ana, all in the province of Pampanga; Lawrence Go, ranked 1 in Subic, Zambales; Matthew Abes Jr., ranked 6 in Tarlac; Ajay Lopez, ranked 8 in Angeles City; and Renan Altares, ranked 7 in Olongapo City.</p>
