      <p><a href="http://gizmochina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a>‘s ecological chain company <a href="http://gizmochina.com/tag/viomi">Viomi</a> has launched the Viomi Baseboard electric heater Pro. This product comes just a few days after Xiaomi’s <a href="http://gizmochina.com/tag/mijia">MIJIA</a> smart home brand launched the MIJIA Electric Baseboard Heater with a similar design. Since they both feature almost the same design and features, we’ll cover the two products in one article.</p>

      <p>The similarity in the design is a pointer to the fact that most of Xiaomi’s branded smart home products are actually manufactured by third-parties but bear the firm’s brand ID. In this case, both electric baseboard heaters may have been manufactured by Viomi. The MIJIA branded heater comes in the traditional white paint job for which Xiaomi’s tech products have gained popularity.  The Viomi Electric Baseboard Heater Pro, on its part, comes in a cool dark grey colour.</p>
      <p>The Viomi Electric Baseboard uses two kinds of heat conduction methods: heat radiation and natural convection. The cold air is sucked into the heater, and after being heated by the machine, it spreads from the top air outlet. In this way, the entire house is evenly heated without drying the air. This method also enables heating up a wide area.</p>
      <p>In terms of design, the baseboard heaters both come with a compact size and are easy to install. It can also be moved around the house easily. It features 136 pieces of aluminium alloy heating elements and can achieve rapid heating of just 5 seconds. The air outlet has high-temperature resistance, so won’t be deformed easily by heat. The MIJIA eater comes with a lesser 127 heating element design</p>

      <p>The temperature can be adjusted between 5-35 °C to meet different heating needs. It also supports smart constant-temperature algorithm, which automatically matches the optimal heating power according to the set temperature and the ambient temperature, so that the indoor temperature remains relatively constant, achieving the effect of energy-saving and efficiency.</p>
      <h4>EDITOR’S PICK: <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/10/01/first-samples-from-the-100mp-mi-mix-alpha-is-here-we-are-not-impressed">First Samples from the 108MP Mi Mix Alpha is here &amp; we are not impressed!</a></h4>
      <p>The baseboard heaters can also be used to dry clothes during wet days. All you need do is place the heater just under the clothing rack. No fear of water damaging the device as it comes with an IPX4-rated waterproof design. The water won’t even get to the electric or heating components as it drips from the clothes.</p>
      <p>Finally, you also get support for voice control on the Viomi Baseboard heater. In this regard, voice prompts can be used to switch on the device as well as adjust the heating mode. The MIJIA model can be controlled via the XiaoAI and MIJIA app as well. This should also include the use of voice prompts in addition to smartphone remote control. Yet another difference between both models is that the MIJIA heater has an LCD display at the side of the air outlet. On the other hand, the Viomi model has its own LCD display which shows the running temperature at the front right corner of the body. Both models have anti-slip bases ad child protection lock.</p>
      <p>In terms of the prices, the Viomi Electric Baseboard heater Pro comes in at 499 yuan (~$71) while the MIJIA-branded model has a price tag of 599 yuan (~$85). That’s sort of ironical as the MIJIA model is less powerful.</p>
