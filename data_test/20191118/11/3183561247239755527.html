      <p>Last week Motorola announced it was unleashing a foldable version of its classic Razr phone.</p>
      <p>While the revamped Razr is set to go on pre-sale in U.S. in late December, there was no set time period for Australia, until now.</p>

      <p>The info was revealed over the weekend on <a href="https://www.2gb.com/podcast/life-and-technology-november-16th/">2GB's Life and Technology show </a>by Motorola's APAC GM of Sales, Danny Adamopoulos.</p>
      <p>The discussion starts with the specs and features of the upcoming phone, and then moves into the reason for creating a foldable Razr.</p>
      <p>According to Adamopoulos, Motorola wasn't originally intending to reinvent the Razr. Instead, it was looking to solve two consumer pain points - wanting large screen real estate without having a large phone in their pocket.</p>
      <p>It was towards the end of the segment at (from 30:37) that the time frame was revealed.</p>
      <p>"It will be going on pre-sale in the the U.S. in December and on sale in the U.S. in January. It will also be coming on sale in Australia in January, but you'll have to wait and see on the local pricing and who's going to take it," said Adamopoulos.</p>
      <p>Adamopoulos also spoke about the device being eSIM only. Considering that we're still in the fledgling stages of eSIMs in Australia, we expect this to limit your carrier options.</p>
      <p>For example, you probably won't be able to get a plan with a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) such as Boost Mobile (powered by Telstra) or Circles.Life (powered by Optus).</p>
      <p>At the moment all three major Aussie telcos offer eSIM, but in a relatively limited capacity.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the most significant difference between the Razr and other foldables is that it will remain the size of a phone.</p>
      <p>It has a regular 6.2-inch phone display when unfolded, as opposed to converting from a tablet to a phone.</p>
      <p>It also has a 2.7-inch quick view display on the front of the device so you can quickly check notifications and control music.</p>
      <p>Under the hood you'll find a Snapdragon 710 processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage, 2,500 mAh battery, 16MP front facing camera and 5MP internal camera.</p>
      <p>Australian pricing for the Razr hasn't been announced yet, but it will cost $US1,499. We'll let you know when we have more details on that and the exact release date.</p>
