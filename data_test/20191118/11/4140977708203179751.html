            <b>: Sorry Canada face a tricky test when they clash heads against Jamaica today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>They might be sitting adjacent to each other in Group A but the form and brand of cricket the two have doled out couldn’t be any more opposing in nature. Where Jamaica are coming into this encounter with two wins on the bounce, Canada have managed to muster up a sorry singular win in their four matches, seeing the side be embroiled in a torrid impasse since day one.</p>
          <p>The side come into today’s clash having been defeated by Jamaica only in their last contest. Needing 244 to win, the win was relatively a comfortable one for the home side at the end of the day as they eased their way to the target at hand in just 44 overs with 4 wickets to spare to move into third place with the two wins and two defeats from four matches.</p>

                <p>Where the defeat was Canada’s third in four matches to leave them languishing in fourth place, for Jamaica the result couldn’t have been any more important. The side began the league with two straight defeats as well but have managed to overhaul their underachieving form ever since to go on an uprise in the group standings, a discourse they’ll be looking to reverberate come today as well against an opponent they have already gotten the better off.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>There is something on offer for everything over here with the ball ripping around in the hands of the quicks in the first of the match but nothing too much to perturb the bats from coming out and piling on the runs. The pitch settles into its groove eventually, something which will lead the side winning the toss selecting to come out and chase today.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>CAN Vs JAM Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>We begin with the home side’s Aldaine Thomas in the wicket-keeping slot owing to two reasons. His involvement behind the wickets against a Canada unit guilty of wavering and waning will see him be heavily involved with dismissals which paired with his ability to score quick runs makes him a good option for the day.</p>
                            <h3>CAN Vs JAM Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>The 246 runs he’s scored in 4 matches have seen Assad Fudadin emerge as his unit’s leading run scorer to make the bat from the side an instant pick in this socket of our side. Up against a paper thin bowling unit and playing on a good wicket are all ingredients to point towards Jamaica piling on the runs today, seeing us get in Nkrumha Bonner as well with the player having scored 153 runs this season.</p>
                            <p>From Canada meanwhile we have gone in with just the one option in the form of Kunwarpal Tathgur with the player having raked up 106 runs up till now for the side.</p>
                            <h3>CAN Vs JAM Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Rovman Powell needed some time to get going but the player finally rediscovered his form which has seen him become such a stalwart of his side in the foregone contest against Canada. The player ended up galloping his way to a meticulous century, a knock which made him the first pick on our minds when venturing into this docket of our Dream 11 setup.</p>
                            <p>We finds company in the identity of Dennis Bulli whilst from Canada we are opting for the two picks as well in the form of Nitish Kumar and Harsh Thaker who has snare the 5 wickets in 3 matches. For quite some time now, Nitish Kumar has been waging a lone battle in the side’s Dream 11 unit and the player has continued to regale us in the same imperious outings this time around as well to score 198 runs in 4 matches.</p>
                            <h3>CAN Vs JAM Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Canada’s top wicket taker, Kanwar Mann is our first choice over here with the player having returned with 7 wickets till now. He will be accompanied by Shahid Ahmadzai, someone who comes into our unit owing to his ability to play pivotal cameos lower down the middle-order, something which has seen him come up with 120 runs till now.</p>
                            <p>Our Dream 11 side is brought to an end by the pick of Derval Green from Jamaica with the new ball bowler coming bearing with him an expansive and enticing brand of wicket to wicket line and length.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Powell is chosen as our captain for this while Nitish will be our vice-captain.</p>
