      <p>Cape Town - Janet Jackson’s fans are not having any of it!</p>
      <p>During her concert in Brisbane, Australia on Friday 15 November, people stormed out of the venue, accusing the 53-year-old of lip-synching throughout her performance, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/janet-jackson-lip-syncing-concert"><b>Fox News</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>Concert-goer Stuart Watson told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7692069/RnB-Fridays-Live-crowd-walk-Janet-Jackson-concert-Brisbane.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a> the<i> That’s The Way Love Goes</i> singer’s performance was "terrible". </p>
      <p>"When Janet Jackson came on it was just a disaster," he said.</p>
      <p>"Her sound was just terrible. She would be singing and then all of a sudden just do random stuff."</p>
      <p>A video taken and posted on social media shows fans walking out just two songs into Jackson’s performance, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10359868/janet-jackson-fans-slam-disastrous-performance-as-they-walk-out-of-concert-after-accusing-her-of-lip-syncing/"><b>The Sun</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"She’s so obviously lip-synching and barely even dancing. On top of which she looks so out of shape. So unfair to the audience," one fan said.</p>
      <p>"If you are going to tour and charge people all that money then do your job @janetjackson."</p>
