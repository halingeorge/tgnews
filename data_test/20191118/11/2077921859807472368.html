      <h1>New David Schwimmer-Starring Comedy Series Intelligence Airs in February</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:32:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p><i>Friends</i> alum David Schwimmer has shared the first look for his new comedy series, <i>Intelligence</i>.</p>
      <p>The new Sky original production is set in the U.K.’s highly regarded Government Communications Headquarters (described in a press release as “a weedier, geekier, more bureaucratic version of MI5 and MI6”) and follows a power-hungry, maverick NSA agent, played by Schwimmer. When he joins inept and tactless computer analyst (Nick Mohammed, <i>The Martian</i>) and a newly formed team tackling cybercrime, everything they know is shaken up.</p>
      <p>Mohammed will write, star in and executive produce the six-part series, with Schwimmer also executive producing. Jon Mountague, Head of Comedy at Sky Entertainment, said in a statement, “Mohammed has written a brilliantly funny comedy series in <i>Intelligence</i>. David &amp; Nick are hilarious together and so perfectly represent the special relationship between our two great nations. I can’t wait.” Well, we don’t have to wait long: Schwimmer’s tweet promises a Feb. 18, 2020, premiere.</p>
