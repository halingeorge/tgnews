      <h1>Bridgette Motsepe-Radebe on Botswana saga: 'I fear for my life'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:53:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author">Azarrah Karrim</a></address>
      <p>South African businesswoman Bridgette Motsepe-Radebe still fears for her life after South African banks cleared her name in a saga involving allegations that she illicitly funnelled money to Botswana to effect regime change.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Monday, she explained that "the exposure [a] of state-sponsored black propaganda campaign follows revelations from a divorce case in Botswana involving a spousal party employed by the country's intelligence services".</p>
      <p>"As spurious as these accusations are, I am naturally concerned about the damage these claims have caused to my reputation.</p>
      <p>"I am also fearful for my life now. We have seen from the details of the <a href="https://city-press.news24.com/News/bridgette-motsepe-radebe-cited-in-botswana-r10-billion-theft-20191103">DIS agent's divorce case</a> that these 'black propaganda' campaigns also include the so-called elimination of targets", she said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Motsepe-Radebe maintains her innocence.</p>
      <p>"To date, none of the accusations about me have been proven or tested in a court of law. I therefore ask, what is next to follow? An attempt on my life?"</p>
      <p>The businesswoman had been accused of being a signatory on bank accounts valued at more than $10bn, said to be stolen from the Botswana government, allegedly to finance a coup.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'State-sponsored smear campaign'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nedbank, Absa and Standard Bank have confirmed that Motsepe-Radebe was not a signatory on bank accounts set up for the alleged illicit money flows.</p>
      <p>She has maintained that the accusations have been part of a smear campaign by the Botswana government, and once again called on authorities in Botswana and South Africa to investigate.</p>
      <p>"It is quite apparent that all of these wild claims about me are part of what has already been exposed as a state-sponsored smear campaign that is being executed by the intelligence operatives of the government of Botswana," Motsepe-Radebe said in the statement.</p>
      <p>She added: "I therefore call on the authorities in Botswana to investigate all of these claims against me and to probe the evident abuse of state resources against private individuals.</p>
      <p>"I am also calling on the South African authorities to investigate the veracity of these claims since I am alleged to have committed crimes from South Africa against a neighbouring country."</p>
      <p>The allegations stem from a report in Botswana's Sunday Standard, which alleged that Motsepe-Radebe smuggled millions of rand to Botswana to fund political campaigns and laundered billions of dollars.</p>
      <p>At a <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/motsepe-radebe-on-botswana-ive-never-given-money-for-anything-regarding-regime-change-20191031">media briefing</a> last month, Motsepe-Radebe expressed her intention to sue the publication and she has vowed to continue the fight to clear her name.</p>
      <p>"As I have done with engaging the banks to expose the truth, I will continue fighting to clear my name. The defamation case against the Standard newspaper in Botswana will also commence soon," she said.</p>
