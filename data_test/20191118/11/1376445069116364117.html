      <p>Nov. 18, 2019 -- A Utah raw pet food company is recalling one brand of its frozen cat food for concerns it may be contaminated with <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/salmonella-faq">salmonella</a>.</p>
      <p>GoRaw LLC, doing business as Steve’s Real Food, has recalled its 2-pound bags of frozen Quest Beef Cat Food. Health officials in Minnesota say a sample tested positive for salmonella.</p>
      <p>Quest Beef Cat Food and other Steve’s Real Food products are sold in smaller, independent pet stores around the country.</p>
      <p>There have not been any reports of injury or illness from the recalled products, the FDA says.</p>
      <p>If you have the Quest Beef Cat Food in your freezer, you may return it to the store for a refund. But if you do so, it’s important that you use caution. The company says you should treat its products the way you would raw chicken: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cold-prevention-hand-washing">Wash your hands</a> after handing it, and clean counters and surfaces the food may have touched.</p>
      <p>If you have questions, contact the company at 801-432-7478, Monday-Friday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET.</p>
