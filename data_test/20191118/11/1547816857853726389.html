      <p>Well, there’s no Bollywood movie complete without a villain. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/coolie-no-1-remake-this-varun-dhawan-sara-ali-khan-starrer-finds-its-villain-in-vikas-verma/5d591ef55203ad37414532fc">For Coolie No. 1, Vikas Verma has been signed to play the villain in the film</a>. Speaking about his role in David Dhawan’s next, Vikas had told Hindustan Times, “When David sir called me in March and told me he has a part [for me] in a film he was making. I was too excited to ask anything else, and it was enough he had remembered me. Also, I had no idea it was for Coolie No 1 remake. But finally, it’s happening. I had to beef up for the character. David sir wanted me to go bigger and sharper for the role as I play a baddie.”</p>
