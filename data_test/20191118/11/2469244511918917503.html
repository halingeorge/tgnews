      <p>Pudsey ears, spotty clothes and lots of cakes have helped people across Mid Devon contribute to a £47.9m Children in Need total.</p>
      <p>Events took place on Friday, November 15 where in Tiverton, Park Hill Daycare’s staff and children dressed in brightly coloured clothes and made donations of £1 towards the charity. The team were particularly impressed by Dan’s bright yellow suit.</p>
      <p>Bolham Primary school held a non-uniform day and cake sale. Headteacher Denise Woodgate said: “Once again the parents and families have been extremely generous and the children raised over £192 for this year’s event.”</p>
      <p>Tidcombe School was a sea of yellow. Children created moveable Pudsey Bears, Pudsey collage and even performing a Pudsey dance. The final amount raised was £158.50.</p>
