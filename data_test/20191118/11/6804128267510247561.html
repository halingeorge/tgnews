      <h2>Harry Redknapp has been talking about the Premier League top-four race</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham manager <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/harry-redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a> has provided his verdict on which teams will make the Premier League top four.</p>
      <p>Liverpool and Manchester City are widely expected to be the league's top two come next May despite the Reds' nine-point advantage over Pep Guardiola's men at the moment.</p>
      <p>But when it comes to the rest of the top six or seven teams, there are many differing opinions on how the 2019/20 campaign is going to pan out.</p>
      <p>Redknapp, for one, is backing <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> and Leicester City to keep up their form and retain their spots in the top four, but it's bad news for <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> and Manchester United, while <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> are also in a tough position.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery is under pressure at Arsenal following a rough start that has the Gunners eight points behind fourth.</p>
      <p>United are nine points back, while Spurs are a remarkable eleven points off the top four.</p>
      <p>Redknapp told The Sun: "Tottenham have it all on now to get in the top four this year.</p>
      <p>"The only thing now in their favour is that Arsenal look so poor. Chelsea are doing great, they’re going to be challenging. Leicester are going to be bang in there.</p>
      <p>"But you’re looking at Arsenal — and Manchester United — and wondering if they are going to make it this year. I can see both of those two not making the top four unless there is a big improvement.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a disappointing season so far for Spurs. I really thought they would be close to Manchester City and Liverpool and challenging.</p>
      <p>"It’s difficult. The players haven’t hit the form they did last year. I’m a big fan of the manager and hopefully they can turn it around."</p>
