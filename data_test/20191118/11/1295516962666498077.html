      <p>The Snyder Cut refers to the director's original version of <i>Justice League</i>, which was never completed<i>. </i>Snyder left the film during production due to a family tragedy. <i>The Avengers</i> director Joss Whedon stepped in to complete reshoots, which reportedly gave the version of the film that released in theaters a lighter tone.</p>
