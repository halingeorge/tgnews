      <p>With three elections in under five years, politics in the UK can be disorienting. But how much can you remember from the last poll, back in 2017?</p>
      <p>Over these three rounds, test your knowledge of which seats were won by the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats at the last General Election.</p>
      <p>Youâ€™ll gain 15 points for a right answer, but lose five for every wrong one, so choose carefully!</p>
