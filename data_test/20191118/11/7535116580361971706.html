      <p>Many of us struggle to lose weight, and it‚Äôs not a very easy thing to do as you need to put in lots of time and effort into workouts and meal-preps while being a working adult.</p>

      <p>An <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2019/is-the-king-of-the-jungle-really-a-couch-potato-new-behaviour-profiles-to-combat-obesity/">international study</a> has found that workers with physically demanding jobs have a greater risk of being obese if they are inactive out of their working hours than other workers who have a pretty well-balanced activity rate.</p>
      <p>Researchers from four universities (University of South Australia, the University of G√§vle, the University of Copenhagen and the University of Southern Denmark) collaborated with Denmark‚Äôs National Research Centre for the Working Environment to conduct this study, reported <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/2019/11/17/being-too-active-at-work-could-make-you-obese">The Star</a>.</p>
      <p>A triaxial accelerometer was attached to the thighs of 807 blue-collar workers to track their time use. This device will allow researchers to be able to analyse links between work, leisure and obesity.</p>
      <p>The tracker recorded the workers‚Äô movements over four 24-hour sessions (with at least two working days). In addition to that, the workers also jotted down their activities in a diary. The indicators of obesity in this context are waist circumference, weight, and body fat percentage.</p>

      <p>From that data, the workers are separated into 4 categories based on their activity patterns during work and leisure time: Ants, Koalas, Lions and Chimpanzees.</p>
      <p>Ants: people who are active throughout the day, both at work and at leisure;</p>
      <p>Chimpanzees: people who have a relatively even distributed composition of work and leisure behaviours;</p>
      <p>Koalas: people who are more sedentary and less physically active at work and at leisure, while also spending more time in bed; and,</p>
      <p>Lions: people who are very active at work, but mostly sit around at home and stay in bed longer.</p>
      <p>You might think that koalas would be most at risk for obesity but that is not true. Research shows that lions have the highest risk of being obese!</p>

      <p>Dr. Dumuid from the University of South Australia says that this study challenges the belief that exerting a lot of energy is a sure-fire way of being fit when in fact, finding for a balance between exertion and resting is the ultimate move.</p>
      <p>She also said that if the body does not have enough time to rest then the body goes into a state of inflammation, where one of the side effects is that it stores excess energy as fats.</p>
      <blockquote>‚ÄúSimilarly, someone who is very active at work, but crashes in front of the TV each night is not getting the right balance either ‚Äì the body needs a balance of activity and recovery throughout the day.‚Äù</blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>So guys, make sure that you are active throughout the day but also getting enough rest as equilibrium is a way for you to make sure that you are healthy!</i>
