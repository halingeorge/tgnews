      <p>Michelle Visage has slammed former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> pro James Jordan after he appeared to accuse her of "fake tears" on the show.</p>
      <p>The RuPaul's Drag Race star <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-michelle-visage-voted-out-in-week-9/">became the latest celebrity to be eliminated from the BBC programme this weekend</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Michelle has now found herself locked in an online feud with James, who criticised her routine to Madonna's Vogue on Saturday night.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He tweeted last night: "I actually believed that Michelle was a real contender and had some great performances.</p>
      <p>"I was really starting to love their partnership. They took a risk this week with the Vogue dance (If you can call it that) It just didn’t pay off. And people at home obviously felt the same."</p>

      <p>Michelle replied: "The only way to change the world is by taking risks. I'm SOOOOOO proud of this dance and going out on this one."</p>

      <p>He then replied: "You should be proud of yourself as I thought you and Giovanni were brilliant together. In fact I thought you had a chance of winning.</p>
      <p>"Change doesn’t always mean it’s better but you took a risk it just didn’t pay off. You still did great xxx."</p>
      <p>Michelle said: "Thank you. Change is how we move forward, that doesn't have to mean better or even worse, it means it's necessary at times for progression. For me, this was one of those times...."</p>

      <p>However, it seems the friendly exchange turned sour after viewers sent Michelle a prior tweet from James which appeared to accuse her of fake tears on the show.</p>
      <p>He had said: "FAKE TEARS!!!! Boring!!!!"</p>
      <p>Michelle replied: "Wowwwww."</p>

      <p>In another previous tweet, James had said: "Didn’t like Michelle’s dance the first time but hated it the second Shame because she was a bloody good dancer EASY EASY decision though."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She responded: "Also James, you should @ people when you talk about them! That's all."</p>
      <p>James tweeted his followers: "I love the fact I’m being trolled by @michellevisag for my honest opinions on Twitter and never once '@' her in any tweet.</p>
      <aside>Didn’t realise I wasn’t allowed my own opinion on my own account.</aside>
      <p>"Didn’t realise I wasn’t allowed my own opinion on my own account. Think she’s still upset 'her' community didn’t save her. Don’t blame me."</p>

      <p>Following her elimination alongside professional partner Giovanni Pernice, Michelle penned a loving message to him on Instagram.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Ohhhhhhhh my partner @pernicegiovann1 where do I start? WE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER! There is NO ONE I would've rather done this with than YOU.</p>
      <p>"You are my magical Italian Virgo and I'll miss seeing your face everyday. I'll miss laughing in your face everyday. I'll miss everything about our time together but you know what? You are stuck with me for life now! (sic)"</p>
