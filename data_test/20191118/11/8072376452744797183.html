      <p>The long-in-gestation Intel OneAPI <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi">project</a> — a set of tools and libraries for building and deploying applications across diverse architectures including CPU, GPU and FPGA hardware — has finally landed, a year <a href="https://www.cbronline.com/news/intel-strategy-architecture">after</a> first being teased.</p>
      <p>The chip giant’s big reveal came at the Supercomputing 2019 event in Colorado this week, where Intel also revealed a range of other new products and services including a new 7nm GPU line for the data centre dubbed “Ponte Vecchio”.</p>
      <p>The Intel OneAPI project aims to make it easier to build tools on top of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial (SVMS) architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, AI, FPGA; it uses the Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) language: an evolution of C++ that allows code reuse across hardware targets, while permitting accelerator-specific tuning.</p>
      <p>(The language is a cross-industry alternative to proprietary languages that’s a hybrid of C++ and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL</a>, Khronos Group’s high-level programming model based on OpenCL.)</p>
      <p>OneAPI will support both direct programming and API programming.</p>
      <p>Intel has released a base tool kit to help programme hardware, along with six domain-specific toolkits, spanning high performance computing (HPC), the Internet of Things (IoT), debugging, analytics, rendering and OpenVINO – each designed to simply implementation of these domain specific applications varios accelerators.</p>

      <p>A new line of GPUs meanwhile will use Intel’s Xe architecture, which the company has split into three differentiating marketing segments; consumer graphics, data centre and AI or HPC. Raja Koduri, GM of architecture, graphics and software <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-unveils-new-gpu-architecture-optimized-for-hpc-ai-oneapi/#gs.gs0ryw">said:</a> “HPC and AI workloads demand diverse architectures, ranging from CPUs, general-purpose GPUs and FPGAs, to more specialized deep-learning NNPs…”</p>
      <p>“Simplifying our customers’ ability to harness the power of diverse computing environments is paramount, and Intel is committed to taking a software-first approach that delivers a unified and scalable abstraction for heterogeneous architectures.”</p>
      <p>The Ponte Vecchio graphics card will be manufactured using not just Intel’s 7nm processing wing, but will also use its ‘Foveros 3D’ high-performance three-dimensional integrated circuit and the firm’s packaging technology for high density interconnected chips the ‘Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge’ (EMIB).</p>
      <p>Although the company bills it as its first “exascale graphics card,” that kind of firepower would require multiple cards working together over very faste fabric.</p>

      <p>Intel is working to install Ponte Vecchio graphic cards into the Aurora supercomputer system at Argonne National Laboratory, USA. Aurora will contain two 10nm-based Intel Xeon Scalable processors and six Ponte Vecchio GPUs. The Aurora system will eventually work at the exascale level which can compute a billion billion calculations a second or a thousand raised to the power of six (1018) operations per second.</p>
      <p>It appears that two versions of the oneAPI are being released; an industry-wide facing one and an Intel beta that will give developers a portfolio of developer’s tools such as libraries, compilers and domain-focused toolkits.</p>
