      <h1>Pro-Brexit protesters 'disperse' after police attend Blaydon Roundabout demonstration</h1>
      <h2>Northumbria Police say no crime was committed but that the group dispersed after speaking to officers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:43:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:43</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham</a></address>
      <p>Demonstrators calling for Britain to leave the EU "dispersed" from their spot on a busy roundabout after being approached by police.</p>
      <p>Two men, who appeared to be supporters of the Brexit Party, unfurled a banner on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/blaydon">Blaydon Roundabout</a>, on the A695 in Gateshead, early on Monday.</p>
      <p>But by 8.30am the pair and their poster, which read "We voted Leave", had left the area after police were called.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> mum Josephine Bridger contacted Chronicle Live after seeing officers speaking to the group, branding the intervention "ridiculous".</p>
      <p>She claimed police cars which had pulled up near the roundabout were causing more traffic problems than the demonstrators, who were on foot.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was taking my son to school and as we approached Blaydon Roundabout we saw there were a couple of men there, standing on the grass with signs protesting for Brexit.</p>
      <p>"On my way back there were two police cars there. The two men were just silently protesting, just with a poster. I just couldn't believe it when I saw the police were there, I thought 'have they got nothing better to do?'."</p>
      <p>Josephine said she believed the pair didn't pose a safety risk.</p>
      <p>She said: "At the end of the day, people have the right to protest and I can't see why the police are getting involved, it's ridiculous.</p>
      <p>"I just thought, 'how stupid' - it's uneccesary. They talk about police being under-manned: I'm sorry, but if they can get out to something like this they're not."</p>
      <p>The location of the protest divided opinion, however.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, one person accused the men of "wasting police time".  And on a local Facebook group, several people expressed safety concerns.</p>
      <p>The group's banner bore the Brexit Party's logo, which is shaped like an arrow pointing right - in the opposite direction to the flow of traffic on a rounabout.</p>
      <p>One said: "There are ways to protest but not like this. That round about is a nightmare and very busy. They could have caused a nasty accident."</p>
      <p>A Northumbria Police spokesperson said “We have received a report of concern for a group of individuals who were believed to be protesting on a roundabout in Blaydon shortly after 7.30am today.</p>
      <p>"Officers attended and spoke to the individuals who then dispersed. No criminal offences had been carried out and no one was injured.”</p>
      <p>It's understood that the officers did not tell the protesters to leave, but spoke to them and offered "safety advice".</p>
      <p>Blaydon is one of the constituencies being targeted by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in the upcoming election, and is putting forward Michael Robinson as its candidate.</p>
