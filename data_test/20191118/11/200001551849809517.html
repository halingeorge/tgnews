      <p>As Leeds United and Brentford fans will know well, Pontus Jansson is probably at his happiest when watching his beloved Malmo.</p>
      <p>The defender made that clear when at Elland Road, and since leaving Leeds United, after reportedly ending up on the wrong side of Marcelo Bielsa, he’s continued the trend at Brentford.</p>
      <p>When Jansson can get back to Sweden to watch his hometown club, he’ll grab the chance, even if it means cutting it fine on a return to training.</p>
      <p>After Malmo, Jansson is likely most happy, at least in a football sense, when leading a team. despite only arriving in the summer, Jansson quickly became captain at Brentford, something he drops into interviews repeatedly.</p>
      <p>On Monday evening, he’s set to wear the armband for his country, in a Euro 2020 qualifier against the Faroe Islands.</p>
      <p>Sweden manager Janne Andersson is expected to name a much changed line-up, and Jansson is ready to lead his country, and be harsh with teammates if required.</p>
      <p>Quoted by <a href="https://www.fotbollskanalen.se/sverige/pontus-jansson-fladdrar-nagon-i-vag-sa-far-den-sig-en-small-pa-kinden/?utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=">Fotbollskanalen</a>, he explained: <i>“My words as the team captain before we go out on the pitch will be that we should think about the collective more than the individual. If the collective works and we make a good effort as a team, the individual efforts will also be good. That’s what I’m going to push for.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“If someone stutters in the road and just thinks of himself, he gets a slap on the cheek. No, but it’s about doing good as a team. It has been our strength in this team… We will continue to do so.”</i>
