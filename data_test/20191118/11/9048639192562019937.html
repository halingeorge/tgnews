      <p><b>LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) -</b> An appellate court has upheld the convictions of sentences of a man who broke into a Louisiana home and recorded himself raping a female at gunpoint.</p>
      <p>The American Press reports part of the video was played for jurors at the 2017 trial of 23-year-old Javonta Jermel Harrison. He was convicted of aggravated rape, armed robbery with a firearm and aggravated burglary. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment, 104 years’ imprisonment and 30 years’ imprisonment.</p>
      <p>After the attack, the then 18-year-old Harrison took the woman’s bank card, cellphone and the keys to her boyfriend’s car. During the trial, the victim said in a letter to the court that Harrison was “the devil himself” and had ruined her life.</p>
