      <h1>Christmas ham prices may soar in Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T11:42:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/christine-mcginn/" target="_blank">Christine McGinn</a></address>
      <p>Australians may have to fork out up to 60 per cent more for their Christmas hams this year due to a shortage of pork, an industry spokesman says.</p>
      <p>The cost of pork could rise thanks to a surge in exports after African swine fever decimated pig herds across Europe and Asia, Victorian Farmers Federation’s Tim Kingma says.</p>
      <p>“There definitely is a shortage of pork around the world. The last two years, the actual hams at Christmas have been fairly cheap,” the pig farmer told 3AW radio on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Because we’ve had the droughts the costs have been more.</p>
      <p>“We’ve actually lost over 10 per cent more of the industry – peak family farmers have gone out, so there is scope to improve and for those people to come back into the industry.”</p>
      <p>African swine fever is an untreatable, infectious virus that affects domestic pigs, warthogs and bush pigs and kills within days.</p>
      <p>It can be spread when pigs eat infected meat products and through direct contact.</p>
      <p>Humans cannot be infected but authorities predict the disease will eradicate up to a quarter of the global pig stocks and obliterate Asian piggeries.</p>
      <p>There’s no vaccine or cure for the disease.</p>
      <p>There is estimated to be up to 24 million wild boars across Australia, sparking fears the disease could spread quickly if it gets into the wild.</p>
      <p>If a local outbreak occurred, it could cost the Australian pork industry $2 billion.</p>
