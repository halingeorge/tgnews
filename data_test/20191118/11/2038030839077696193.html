      <p>Cape Town – Travis Scott posted the cutest picture of Stormi on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-4BL6JWtt/"><b>Instagram</b></a> this weekend!</p>
      <p>The <i>Sicko Mode</i> rapper wrote "Daddy’s hair" on a picture of the one-year-old twinning with her dad.</p>
      <p>She was dressed in sneakers, a black skinny jeans, an Astroworld shirt with her hair in braids, of course.</p>
      <p>On another post, he wrote, simply, "Stormi’s world."</p>

      <p>Though <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/kylie-jenner-and-travis-scott-split-20191002"><b>Travis and Kylie announced they were "taking space apart"</b></a> in October, it looks as though the rapper and the beauty mogul really are making Stormi their main priority.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1094328/travis-scott-shares-adorable-photos-of-daughter-stormi-webster-channeling-his-style"><b>E! News</b></a>, Kylie even flew Stormi to Houston about a week ago to watch Travis perform.</p>
      <p>Kylie and Stormi looked like they had the best time supporting the rapper.</p>
