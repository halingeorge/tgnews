        <b>About nine people were shot and “several” killed after gunmen sneaked into the backyard of a home in Fresno, California, during a family gathering and opened fire Sunday, the authorities said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Friends and family at the home were watching a football game when the gunmen opened fire, Lt. Bill Dooley of the Fresno Police Department said at a news conference late Sunday night. Dooley said the gunmen then fled the scene.</p>
      <p>The authorities received reports of the shooting around 6 p.m. local time.</p>
      <p>“What we found were several individuals deceased in the backyard,” Dooley said.</p>
      <p>Some people were taken to a nearby hospital and some were in critical condition, he said.</p>
      <p>He added, “This was a mass casualty shooting, there’s no doubt about it.”</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear if the police had made any arrests. Dooley did not release any information about the gunmen.</p>
      <p>Videos posted on social media showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street lined with residential homes.</p>
