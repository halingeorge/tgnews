      <h1>Stephen A. Smith Blasted Eric Reid For His Support of Kaepernick In A Long Written Rant (PIC)</h1>

      <p>Colin Kaepernick held his workout for NFL teams on Saturday and ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith was extremely critical about how it all went down.</p>
      <p>Smith claimed the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback “doesn’t want to play” and he’d rather “be a martyr” than be in the NFL.</p>
      <p>“All of us believe that Colin Kaepernick would’ve showed out, and if he had showed out, I’m here to tell you, I believe he would’ve had a job inside of two weeks. But it didn’t happen because he didn’t show.”</p>
      <p>Eric Reid, a longtime supporter and former teammate of Kaepernick’s, called out Smith, saying he was “tap dancing for the NFL.”</p>

      <p>Reid continued his tirade before Sunday’s game:</p>

      <p>It wouldn’t end there.</p>
      <p>Smith subsequently criticized Reid for tweeting hours before taking the field in a long spirited rant.</p>

      <p>“I still respect the hell out of your immature, belligerent self. But I’m going to call it like I see it. Kaepernick made a mistake the way he handled all this…….IF he really wants a job in the NFL. Period,” Smith wrote. “And your contribution to all of this doesn’t help. It hurts. It ain’t about you being wrong. It’s about you needing to grow the hell up. Your decision. Your life. Do you!”</p>
      <p>Reid didn’t respond to Smith directly, but he did retweet a message from The View co-host Sunny Hostin.</p>
      <p>“Wrong @stephenasmith,” she wrote. “Had Colin participated in a solely NFL filmed event &amp; signed a waiver giving away all legal rights, NFL could have continued to collude &amp; put out information about his ability with no legal recourse. That’s not a workout, that’s a setup. Sound ridiculous?”</p>
      <p>It’s safe to say this feud is far from over.</p>
