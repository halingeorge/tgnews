      <h2>Indian boxer to take on a Ghanaian journeyman on Friday; promoters say next bout could be a ‘big one’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:57:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/gaurav-bhatt/" target="_blank">Gaurav Bhatt</a></address>
      <p>Vijender Singh returns to action this Friday when he takes on Ghanaian Charles Adamu in a 10-round super middleweight contest in Dubai. The Olympic bronze-medallist, who took his professional record to 11-0 (8KOs) in July, will face the journeyman Adamu who has a record of 33-14 (26KOs) over an 18-year-long career.</p>
      <p>“This was a long camp. I had 6-7 sparring sessions with really good boxers. It’s time to show how much I’ve prepared,” said Vijender, who is currently focused on acclimatising to Dubai after a long training camp in Manchester. “It takes a bit of time. Firstly, the UK is really cold at the moment. It was almost 2-3 (degree centigrade). It’s warm here, so it takes a bit of time. The time difference too plays a part but I believe we are on the right track.”</p>

        <b>Explained</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Tough road to world title</h3>
      <p>Of the heavier categories, super middleweight is the most tightly contested, with five reigning champions. The top five organisations WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO and IBO have their own champions with a deep list of contenders. Vijender , who has held WBO regional titles, could gun for Billy Joe Saunders' WBO title. Road to a world title is tough, but Top Rank's pull could held Vijender get notably fights soon.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The ‘Rotunda Rumble II’ card, presented by MTK Global and Round 10 Boxing at Dubai’s Caesars Palace, will feature attractions such as WBO number 1-ranked super-lightweight Jack Catterall and Pakistan’s flyweight sensation Muhammad Waseem. Catterall (24-0, 13KOs), who is penciled in for a world title shot next year, will take on German Timo Schwarzkopf (20-3, 12KOs) in a fight he’s expected to win. Vijender’s contest too seems to be a ‘stay-busy’ fight.</p>
      <p>Vijender’s 42-year-old opponent issued a statement ahead of the fight: “He must know that this fight isn’t going to be easy for him. If he thinks I’ll be one of his earlier opponents whom he’ll brush by then he’s very mistaken.”</p>
      <h3>Mismatch</h3>
      <p>The fact remains that Adamu, who has lost four of his last five fights, doesn’t appear to be an opponent of Vijender’s calibre. Adamu’s two Commonwealth title wins came when the championship was vacant, and he hasn’t won a fight outside Ghana since 2010. “My job is to train, and to fight in the ring,” said Vijender, when asked about his opponent’s pedigree. “Matchmaking is not in my hand. We still have to take precaustions, because he is also very experienced. He has had some tough fights. But about the opponent, you should ask the matchmaker.”</p>
      <p>Vijender’s promoter Neerav Tomar of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ios/">IOS</a> promotions believes this “is the last, kind of a medium fight.” “This would be the last one. Now, Top Rank is going to step on the pedal and those guys are best in the world,” said Tomar. “They know their gameplan. Vijender’s last fight in America too was after a comeback, and he also got injured before it. All that put together, Vijender’s next fight could be a big one. The 13th or 14th fight, could be the one to set him up as a title contender.”</p>
      <p>Vijender, who has been following the lay of the land and the middleweight top dog Canelo Alvarez, believes his career progression has been according to the plan. “Bhaiyya hum toh kab se taiyyar baithe hain (I’ve been prepared for a long time for a bigger fight). But slow and steady wins the race. There’s no need to hurry, we are going with the flow.”</p>
      <h3>Event to remember</h3>
      <p>Arguably, Vijender’s pro-boxing bouts so far have been more about the events than the fights themselves. During the initial run in the United Kingdom, Vijender promoted his fight in Liverpool by paying homage to his “musical heroes”, The Beatles. The two bouts in Delhi were an extended homecoming, while his bout in Mumbai was driven by the Bollywood extravaganza. Even the fight in Jaipur, his last in India, had a connect as Vijender reminisced about the days spent in the city as a ticket collector for the Railways.</p>
      <p>Dubai is no exception, and for good reason. It was Bob Arum’s Top Rank promotions who helped put on the fight to position the Indian as a star in the UAE as well. “This fight came through Top Rank, who suggested us this MTK Global card,” Tomar said. “We were absolutely excited because there are so many Indians in Dubai. It is happening at such an iconic venue.”</p>
      <p>“This is very exciting because it’s almost like a hometown fight for me,” said Vijender. “The language is the same, the people are same. Lot of Indians, Pakistanis. It doesn’t feel like I’m not fighting at home.”</p>
