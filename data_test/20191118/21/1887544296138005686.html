      <p>Toronto police say they have laid child luring and child pornography charges against a suspect after executing a search warrant in Etobicoke.</p>
      <p>Police carried out a search warrant at an address in the area of Brown’s Line and Lakeshore Boulevard West several months ago on Aug. 22.</p>
      <p>Police allege that a year earlier in August of 2018, a child was lured by a suspect on social media.</p>
      <p>According to police, the suspect used the Instagram account “ughshutupbrian” and the Facebook account “Brianmatthew22.”</p>
      <p>The suspect did not actually meet a child in person, police said.</p>
      <p>The same suspect, according to police, accessed and possessed child sexual abuse material from the internet.</p>
      <p>Police announced charges in their investigation on Monday.</p>
      <p>Brian Drury, 33, of Toronto has been charged with luring a child (under 18), possession of child pornography, and accessing child pornography.</p>
      <p>He is scheduled to make a court appearance on Dec. 5.</p>
