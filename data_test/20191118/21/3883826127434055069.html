        <b>An amateur Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter has died after suffering a brain injury during a match.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Saeideh Aletaha, 26, was critically injured at a Fast and Furious Fight Series (FFS) event in Central Hall in Southampton on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>She was taken to Southampton General Hospital shortly before 21:00 GMT, but died later, police said.</p>
      <p>Hampshire Police said it had launched an investigation into exactly what happened.</p>
      <p>FFS posted a statement on Facebook confirming Ms Aletaha had not recovered from her injury, and urged any family and friends needing support to get in touch.</p>
      <h3>'Safe as possible'</h3>
      <p>It said: "All competitors get in prepared that they may be injured, and this is something not expected to happen 99.9% of the time.</p>
      <p>"But, it can, and in this we make the environment as safe as possible with pre and post medicals from a doctor, and full medical cover throughout."</p>
      <p>It said it had a doctor, paramedic and an ambulance on site alongside its own team at the event organised by Lookborai and Exile Gym.</p>
      <p>"Safety is not something ever skimped on in any of our 19 shows and all matches are made equal," it added.</p>
      <h3>'Beautiful soul'</h3>
      <p>Fellow martial artists and friends have paid tribute to Ms Aletaha, known as Sai.</p>
      <p>One posted on Exile Gym's Facebook page: "Saeideh Aletaha was a lovely character with a beautiful soul.</p>
      <p>"Her dedication to the sport was 110% travelling miles every day just to train."</p>
