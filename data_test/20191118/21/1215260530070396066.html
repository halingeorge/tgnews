        <b>Prosecutors have closed their case in the murder trial of two men charged in connection with the beheading of a St Catherine woman and her teenage daughter in 2011.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paula Llewellyn, the lead prosecutor, made the announcement in the Home Circuit Court this afternoon after the final police witness gave evidence.</p>
      <p>Anthony Williams, the attorney representing Sanja Ducally, has since indicated that he intends to ask the court to find that prosecutors have not made out a prima facie case against his client.</p>
      <p>Williams is scheduled to begin making his no-case submissions to presiding judge Vivienne Harris at 3 oâ€™clock this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Ducally and Kemar Riley are among five men charged with the July 20, 2011 killing of Charmaine Cover-Rattray, 40, and her 18-year-old daughter Joeith Lynch inside their Lauriston, St Catherine, home.</p>
      <p>The other three, Adrian Campbell, Fabian Smith, and Roshane Goldson, have already pleaded guilty to non-capital murder and are scheduled to be sentenced on December 13.</p>
