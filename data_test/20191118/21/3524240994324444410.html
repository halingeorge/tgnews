      <p>Oladimeji Ramon</p>
      <p>The Nigerian Army has filed a preliminary objection to a suit filed by human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN), praying the court to stop the army’s Operation Positive Identification, which requires that all citizens must carry a means of identification to be able to move.</p>
      <p>At Falana’s instance, Justice Rilwan Aikawa of the Federal High Court in Lagos had on November 5 stopped the army from going ahead with its Operation Positive Identification pending the hearing and determination of the suit filed by Falana.</p>
      <p>At the resumed proceedings on Monday, counsel for the Nigerian Army, Mrs Olayemi Badewole, noted that the army had filed a preliminary objection.</p>
      <p>Badewole said she further filed a motion dated November 14 seeking to regularise the preliminary objection and prayed the judge to allow the motion.</p>
      <p>As there was no objection from the other parties, Justice Aikawa granted the prayer.</p>
      <p>On his part, The Solicitor General of the Federation, Mr  Dayo Apata (SAN), who represented the Attorney General of the Federation, said he had filed and served all the necessary applications on Falana.</p>
      <p>Responding, Falana, who was represented in court by a lawyer from his office, E. E. Olawale, acknowledge receipt of the processes and prayed for an adjournment to be able to respond.</p>
      <p>As a result, Justice Aikawa adjourned the matter till November 28.</p>
      <p>In the suit, Falana is contending that the army’s Operation Positive Identification was a violation of constitutional rights to liberty.</p>
