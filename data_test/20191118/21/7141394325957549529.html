      <h1>Global Bitcoin and Crypto ATMs Hit 6,000: BTC, Litecoin and Ethereum Leading the Pack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:40:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>There are now more than 6,000 ATMs across the globe that process Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>Coin ATM Radar <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/charts/growth/">tracks</a> the installations, which have grown in number from roughly 4,000 ATMs this time last year and only about 1,800 in November 2017.</p>
      <p>The United States easily has the highest number of crypto ATMs, with 3,834 total machines — nearly six times the second-highest country, Canada, which has 642 machines.</p>
      <p><a href="https://coinatmradar.com/blog/bitcoin-atm-market-dynamics-october-2019/#more-2811">Says</a> Coin ATM Radar,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The United States continue to top the countries list with 239 new machines (6.6% increase) in October. The United Kingdom was second with 10 new installations (4% increase) followed by Greece with 7 new machines (13.5% increase).</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>We are happy to notice that Venezuela installed the first machine on its territory in October.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Also in October, Miami International Airport (MIA) installed its first Bitcoin ATM machine, located in concourse G next to gate 16. MIA ranks as the third-busiest airport in the United States by international traffic.</p>
      <p>Says Doug Carrillo, co-founder ATM operator Bitstop,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“More and more people prefer to travel with Bitcoin instead of cash for convenience and security. Miami International Airport is a perfect place for our customers to conveniently exchange their dollars for Bitcoin and vice versa when traveling domestically or abroad.”</i>

      <p>Of the 6,003 total machines worldwide, 5,999 of them support Bitcoin, 4,101 support Litecoin, 3,565 support Ether, 2,053 Bitcoin Cash, and 1,304 support Dash. A handful also support Monero, Zcash and Dogecoin.</p>
      <p>According to Coin ATM Radar,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The percentage of Bitcoin ATM’s supporting any other than Bitcoin cryptocurrencies increased and now it is 70.4%. Dash was the most added coin in October with 194 (17.77% increase) followed by Litecoin with 192 (5.01% increase) and Bitcoin with 164 (2.87% increase).”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>General Bytes is the top manufacturer. It reached a supply of 1,923 machines by the end of October, followed by Genesis Coin with a grand total of 1,812 machines.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“As usual, the most successful manufacturers in October were Genesis Coin with 99 new machines (5.8% increase) and General Bytes with 96 new installations (5.3% increase) followed by Bitstop with 13 new machines (41.9% increase).<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>A South African manufacturer Ankerpay installed its first machine in October. It is a buy and sell machine located in Stellenbosch.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>The biggest reduction in October was Orderbob ATM who removed 85.1% of their machines (103).”</i>
