      <p>MultiChoice Nigeria has announced the launch of a brand-new reality TV show titled <b><i>‘Ultimate Love’ </i></b>and is calling for auditions this November. The show will air live, 24/7 on all DStv and select GOtv packages starting February 2020.</p>
      <p>A first-of-its-kind reality TV show format, <b><i>Ultimate Love</i></b> is centered around single male and female strangers living together in an isolated location with the hopes of finding life-long love. They are paired based on their mutual attraction to one other as they compete to emerge the ultimate couple of the competition. The winning couple is rewarded with a lavish traditional wedding ceremony, a fully furnished home amongst other prizes. The couples, who are continuously monitored by live television cameras and personal audio microphones, will interact daily with a counsellor fondly referred to as ‘Auntie’ as they embark on their journey to love.</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe said: “Reality TV shows are immensely popular because they showcase real people experiencing real life happenings and situations, thus connecting with viewers and fans on a personal and relatable level. There are fewer things realer than love, and <i>Ultimate Love</i>, our new and exciting reality show celebrates this”.</p>

Our viewers can expect the very best production values and a show experience unlike anything ever seen on African television.” he added.</p>
      <p>For this first season, a total of 16 individuals comprising 8 males and 8 females will be selected through careful auditions and screenings to live together for 8 weeks. They will engage in a series of locally inspired activities as couples with viewers voting off their least favorite couple on a weekly basis.</p>
