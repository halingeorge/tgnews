        <b>A YOB union activist who threw a street party to celebrate Margaret Thatcher’s death is the poster boy of a Scottish Labour election push.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unite organiser Bryan Simpson, who invited 8,000 people to the morbid bash, fronts a broadcast where he chats to Jeremy Corbyn and Scots leader Richard Leonard.</p>

      <p>In the 54-second film, Mr Simpson says: “Only through a Labour government are we going to be able to give workers the power that they need to fight back.”</p>
      <p>Mr Simpson led a conga around Glasgow’s George Square on April 8, 2013 — the day ex-PM Mrs Thatcher died aged 87.</p>
      <p>The law graduate, from Glasgow, was also given a four-month suspended prison sentence for his part in a street protest over tuition fees in London in 2010.</p>
      <p>He was caught on CCTV shouting abuse and tearing off a police medic’s cap, as well as flinging a megaphone towards cops.</p>
      <p>It missed and hit another protester in the head.</p>
      <p>Scottish Tory MSP Annie Wells said: “This individual is unfit to be the public face of any reputable organisation — let alone a poster boy for a political party ahead of a major election.</p>
      <p>“It tells you everything you need to know about Scottish Labour that they’d revert to this level of decision-making.</p>
      <p>“Party bosses should have known exactly who he was, what he’d done, and why he’s unsuitable for this purpose.”</p>
      <p>Mr Simpson declined to comment.</p>
