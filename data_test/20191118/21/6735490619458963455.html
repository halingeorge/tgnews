      <p>“[Clarkson is] doing a great job filling the Adam ‘a**hole void,'” Shelton said in a Q&amp;A on Thursday at his Ole Red restaurant in Nashville, per <a href="https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-reflects-voice-secrets-morgan-wallen-danielle-bradbery/"><i>People</i></a>. Apparently, Clarkson did not take well to that statement when the country crooner told her those exact words.</p>
      <p>Shelton assured the bromance with Levine continues, “just not for the cameras.” He <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/541656/blake-shelton-praises-taylor-swift-for-being-just-so-smart/">also praised mega-mentor Taylor Swift</a>.</p>

      <p>“She’s just so smart,” Shelton said. “That’s the thing: We all know how talented Taylor is, but I think 50 percent of her success is also combining her talent with just literally how smart she is. Every time I’m around her, I love just kind of soaking it in and listening to her talk.”</p>
      <p>“She always has something to say or a way of looking at something that I never have thought that way,” the crooner concluded. “Once you get past the” — Shelton gasped — “‘It’s Taylor Swift!’ you’re even more impressed with her.”</p>
