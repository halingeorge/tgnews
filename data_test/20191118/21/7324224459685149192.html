      <p>An alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein has appealed directly to the Duke of York to “come forward” and give a statement about the convicted sex offender.</p>
      <p>The woman, only identified as Jane Doe 15, urged Andrew to speak to the US authorities during a press conference in Los Angeles where lawyer Gloria Allred announced her client had filed a civil lawsuit against the disgraced financier’s estate.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old, speaking after her lawyer reiterated earlier appeals for the duke to provide a statement, said: “I would also like to say I agree with Gloria that Prince Andrew, and any others that are close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have.”</p>
      <aside>I was contacted by one of Jeffrey Epstein's assistants and invited to Epstein's island where I was told Prince Andrew, among others, would be a guest - I declined the invitation out of fear<cite>Jane Doe 15</cite></aside>
      <p>Speaking about the convicted sex offender, who took his own life in jail while facing sex trafficking charges, she added: “Just because Epstein is dead does not mean others around him don’t deserve their day in court as well.”</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old, who claims she was raped by Epstein when aged 15, said she did not come into contact with Andrew.</p>
      <p>She had been invited to Epstein’s island where the royal would be staying but did not go.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was contacted by one of Jeffrey Epstein’s assistants and invited to Epstein’s island where I was told Prince Andrew, among others, would be a guest – I declined the invitation out of fear.”</p>
      <p>During her testimony, she described how she was first targeted by one of Epstein’s assistants when on a school trip to New York, and later invited to his New Mexico Zorro ranch where she says she was sexually assaulted – only knowing him for five days in total.</p>
      <p>She said the disgraced financier had a foam mattress floor around one bed in the ranch as he like girls to sleep on the floor around him.</p>
      <p>She went on to say: “It was clear from the time I spent with Epstein that something was very wrong with his life style and it didn’t take a victim to see that we were hot hidden.”</p>
      <p>In his interview with the BBC’s Newsnight programme, the duke said: “The other aspect of this is that … I live in an institution at Buckingham Palace which has members of staff walking around all the time and I don’t wish to appear grand, but there were a lot of people who were walking around Jeffrey Epstein’s house.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he would give a statement under oath, the duke replied: “If push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so, then I would be duty bound to do so.”</p>
