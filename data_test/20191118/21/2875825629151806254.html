      <p>Christmas came early for two separate <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/waterford">Waterford</a> punters who walked away with over €5.3 million in Lotto and scratch card prizes.</p>
      <p>The National Lottery confirmed that the lucky ticket holder who won the whopping €5,260,021 Lotto jackpot on Wednesday, October 23, has now collected their prize.</p>
      <p>Their staggering win comes just as the festive season approaches and is sure to take the sting out of this year’s Christmas shopping.</p>
      <p>The winning ticket was sold at the SuperValu store at the Kilbarry shopping centre in Waterford City and was the 8th Lotto jackpot of 2019 with over €50 million paid out in jackpot prizes alone this year.</p>
      <p>And the Deise good luck didn’t stop there, as another Waterford winner scooped up a tasty win on a scratch card.</p>
      <p>Thomas Coughlan from Waterford City got an early Christmas bonus after he won one of the €100,000 top prizes on a Christmas Countdown scratch card.</p>
      <p>Lotto bosses confirmed that there is still one top prize remaining on the €10 Christmas scratch card.</p>
      <p>Coughlan said he was ‘dumbstruck’ by his massive win which he says is a ‘game-changer’ for him and his fiancée Meghan Simpson and their four-year old son.</p>
      <p>The young family have said they plan to spend their winnings on a new home and a wedding in the next 12 months.</p>
      <p>He said, “Quite simply, this win is a complete game-changer for us. We are renting a house at the moment so the dream of buying a house was always a difficult one for us.</p>
      <p>“Trying to save while renting isn’t ideal but with this win, we are that much closer to getting our forever home.</p>
      <p>"And more importantly – we had to sacrifice getting married over buying a house so in the next year, we will have a new home and we will be married, we’re just absolutely thrilled.”</p>
      <p>Coughlan, who works as an architect in Waterford City, bought the winning scratch card on his way home from work last Friday at O’Hare’s supermarket on the Dunmore Road.</p>
      <p>He added, “It’s something we always do every single Friday – we treat ourselves to a scratch card to celebrate the start to the weekend.</p>

      <p>“After we scratched off the €100,000 symbols, we were just dumbstruck and we sat there staring at each other, absolutely certain that we had made a mistake.</p>
      <p>"We jumped back into the car and went back to the shop and they told us that we had a winning ticket.</p>
      <p>“It was just an unbelievable weekend celebrating with family and friends who are absolutely thrilled for us.”</p>
