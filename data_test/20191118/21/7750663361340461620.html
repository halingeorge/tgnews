      <p>As it stands, Willian will be a free agent next June, meaning that the 31-year-old would be able to agree a pre-contract with a foreign club during the January transfer window.</p>

      <p>However, according to <i>Goal.com</i>, Chelsea are currently holding talks with Willian's representatives in the hope that the experienced winger will extend his stay in the English capital.</p>
      <p>Blues boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a> has brought a fresh look to the team this season with a number of youngsters handed opportunities to impress.</p>
      <p>That said, Willian has remained a key figure for the London giants, scoring three times and contributing three assists in 15 appearances in all competitions.</p>
