        <b>Somerset will start the 2020 County Championship season on -12 points after being handed a points deduction for producing a poor pitch against Essex.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Somerset were found guilty of breaching pitch regulations in the <a href="https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/11820033/essex-win-county-championship-ahead-of-somerset-after-final-day-draw">Championship-deciding match against Essex</a> in September, in which the surface at Taunton was rated "poor" due to "excessive unevenness of bounce".</p>
      <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) charged Somerset with a breach of the regulation that requires that: 'Each County shall actively seek to prepare the best quality cricket pitch that it can for the match that it is staging'.</p>
      <p>Somerset had conceded the pitch was correctly rated, but contested the second part of the charge that said it could have been prepared better.</p>
      <p>A three-man panel upheld the verdict in respect of the second element of the charge, and found Somerset guilty of a breach of ECB Pitch Regulations.</p>
      <p>The county have been handed a 24-point deduction, 12 of which have been suspended for two years, ahead of the 2020 County Championship season.</p>
      <p>Somerset have 14 days to appeal the decision.</p>
      <p>A statement on the county's website read: "Somerset County Cricket Club await the full report from the Cricket Discipline Commission before considering our next course of action."</p>
