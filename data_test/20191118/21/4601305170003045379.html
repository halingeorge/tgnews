        <b>From the 1950s until the 1980s, Randy and Dotti Smith supplied a line of fantastic cast sculptures sold in Disney theme-park gift shops, especially a line of skulls sold in shops associated with the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean rides; these <a href="http://collectorgene.com/2012/07/the-randotti-skull-a-staple-of-disneyland-souvenirs-for-several-decades/">Randotti skulls</a> haven't been sold in decades, you can still find used ones (at high prices) online, as Boing Boing pal and fabulous illustrator Coop discovered when he <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/coop666/albums/72157711584578297">sourced an impressive collection</a> of Randotti sculpts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Coop used the skulls as the basis for a set of <a href="https://theartofcoop.bigcartel.com/category/original-art">gorgeous illustrations</a> that he's <a href="https://artofcoop.threadless.com/collections/skulls/">selling as tees and hoodies</a> through Threadless.</p>
      <p>These are some of my favorite designs of all time, and some of my favorite Coop illos: he really captured the spirit of these pieces.</p>
