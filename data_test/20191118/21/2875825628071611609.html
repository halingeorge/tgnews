      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/scarlett-moffatt">Scarlett Moffatt</a> has been dropped as a co-presenter on Saturday Night Takeaway.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old landed the “dream job” in 2017 after being crowned Queen of The Jungle on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! at the end of 2016.</p>
      <p>She replaced former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts – who hosted the show for three years prior.</p>
      <p>An ITV spokesman said: “Scarlett Moffatt won’t feature as a contributor in the 2020 series of Saturday Night Takeaway. We thank Scarlett for all of her hard work on the show and will announce details of the new series nearer transmission”</p>
      <p>An ITV source added: “Show bosses are planning lots of new and exciting features for the 2020 series alongside the return of viewer favourites. Scarlett Moffatt won’t feature in the new series but she’s not being replaced. It will be just Ant and Dec and Stephen Mulhern who will return to host Ant vs Dec.</p>

      <p>“Scarlett did a great job on the series and we thank her for all her hard work but sadly the new series doesn’t have room for her on screen role.”</p>
      <p>A source close to Scarlett said she had a great time on the show but was excited about other TV projects.</p>
      <p>The source said: “She has got lots of other things lined up such as documentaries and more factual programming. She recently did The British Tribe Next Door and has lots of other exciting things in the pipeline.”</p>

      <p>The Geordie star, who started her career on Googlebox, became close friends with Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly after meeting in Oz.</p>
      <p>As well as working together on Ant &amp; Dec’s Saturday NightTakeaway, she also worked alongside them when she co-hosted the spin-off show, I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here Extra Camp for the past two years.</p>
      <p>She was replaced by Emily Atack for this series.</p>

      <p>She has previously said she is such big fan of Ant &amp; Dec that she even sleeps with a picture of them together in Florida in 2017 beside her bed.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the snap, she said: “It’s a picture of me as Mary Poppins. It even beats me in the jungle, like the highlight of my working life. To do the Saturday Night Takeaway finale in Disney World, honestly, was my dream. So every morning when I wake up and see that photo, I’m like, ‘I’m living my dream’.”</p>
