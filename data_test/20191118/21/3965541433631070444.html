      <h1>Seattle begins effort to establish minimum wage for Uber, Lyft drivers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:21:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author">Dyer Oxley | KOMO News</a></address>
      <p>On the heels of Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan's <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-mayors-plan-pushes-pay-raise-worker-protections-for-rideshare-drivers">"Fare Share" plan, </a>which would mandate a minimum wage for Uber and Lyft drivers, the city is now starting a study to determine what the minimum wage should be.</p>
      <p>The study aims to establish a standard minimum wage for rideshare drivers in Seattle. The effort is currently being organized, but its results are expected by spring 2020, <a href="https://durkan.seattle.gov/2019/11/city-of-seattle-announces-start-of-wage-study-to-determine-minimum-wage-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers/">according to the mayor's office</a>. The study's conclusions will influence legislation at city hall and ultimately put the minimum rideshare wage into local regulations.</p>
      <p>"Seattle is a national leader in ensuring our workers are treated fairly, and in this rapidly-changing economy, we need to make sure our hard-fought worker protections are available for our Uber and Lyft drivers," said Mayor Durkan. "Our Fare Share proposal to guarantee minimum compensation for Uber and Lyft drivers will depend on accurate data ... With this study and community input, we will be moving forward on fair wages for drivers next spring.‚Äù</p>
      <p>Economists James Parrott from the New School and Michael Reich with the University of California Berkeley have been tapped to conduct the study. The will consider driver earnings, work time, and expenses to calculate a minimum wage for Seattle. They are the same two experts who were hired for a similar wage study in New York, paid for by the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p>
      <p>According to Bill Heinzen with the taxi and limousine commission, the New York study informed a "trip-based standard" that has resulted in drivers taking home $750 more each month.</p>
      <p>At the same time, a survey of rideshare drivers will be conducted by PRR, a research firm.</p>
      <p>Along with the minimum wage standard, Durkan has also proposed a tax on rides provided by Uber and Lyft. The rideshare companies have<a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-mayor-wants-to-impose-per-ride-tax-on-uber-lyft"> objected to the move</a>, arguing that it will result in fewer rides and ultimately hurt drivers' earnings.</p>
      <p>Rideshare drivers, on the other hand, <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-mayors-plan-pushes-pay-raise-worker-protections-for-rideshare-drivers">have spoken up</a>, saying that many don't earn minimum wage and do not receive benefits despite working long hours.</p>
