      <p>STATEN ISLAND (WABC) -- The death of a young woman found dead in the woods in Staten Island has been ruled a homicide.</p>
      <p>Ola Salem, 25, was <a href="https://abc7ny.com/police-id-body-of-woman-found-in-staten-island-woods/5655191/">found dead in Bloomingdale Park</a> late last month.</p>
      <p>"I would say everyone keeps to themselves, but I would say our house were friendly," one neighbor said.</p>
      <p>By all accounts, Salem was strong. Her father and brother are boxers, and she fought for women as a volunteer at a domestic violence center in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>"She makes you feel that love from her, because she's just so positive," Asiyah Women's Center co-founder and executive director Dania Darwish said. "She's always wanting to give and never asking for anything in return."</p>
      <p>But neighbors near her family's home on Staten Island said they became concerned past few weeks.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I know police coming a few times in this house, that's all I know," a neighbor said.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Triarsi, who lives across the street, said he witnessed an argument spill out onto the front lawn between two men and a woman at the beginning of October.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was going to escalate to real violence, physically," he said. "How do you stop a guy that's in a rage from beating up a woman? So I thought I would call the cops."</p>
      <p>A few weeks later, Salem's body was discovered in the park around 9:30 a.m. on October 24. She was strangled.</p>
      <p>So far, no arrests have been made in the case.</p>
