      <p>VESTAL (WBNG) — As Thanksgiving approaches, Catholic Charities of Broome County is giving you the chance to ensure everyone in Broome County has food on their table this year.</p>
      <p>The annual Thanks-4-Giving Turkey Drive is officially underway, collecting Thanksgiving turkeys, as well as other non-perishable food items, to fight hunger in Broome County this holiday season.</p>
      <p>Organizers with Catholic Charities say these holiday baskets can help those in need enjoy a holiday dinner, something many people take for granted.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to fill those baskets now and make sure everyone gets what they need. There’s a lot of people in need in Broome County. There’s a poverty rate that’s quite higher than it is in the rest of New York State, so we just want to make sure we’re doing our part,” explained Mary Whitcombe.</p>
      <p>Organizers will be in front of Walmart in Vestal’s Town Square Mall from Monday, November 18th through Friday November 22nd, collecting Thanksgiving turkeys and other non-perishables. They say they hope to collect 3,500 turkeys this year.</p>
