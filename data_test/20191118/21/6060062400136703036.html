      <h1>Chick-fil-A is facing backlash after ending donations to controversial Christian charities — but critics are missing an important point</h1>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/chick-fil-a">Chick-fil-A</a> is facing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-criticized-for-donation-decision-2019-11">backlash</a> for its decision to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-ending-donations-criticized-by-lgbtq-activists-2019-11">stop donating to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes,</a> two groups that have been criticized by LGBTQ advocates. </li>
        <li>Former Republican Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the chain "surrendered to anti-Christian hate groups." </li>
        <li>However, Chick-fil-A will still emphasize its founder's Christian values, close on Sundays, and remain open to donating to faith-based groups. </li>

      <p>Chick-fil-A is facing backlash for its decision to stop donating to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. </p>
      <p>"We made multiyear commitments to both organizations, and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018. Moving forward you will see that the Chick-fil-A Foundation will support the three specific initiatives of homelessness, hunger and education," a Chick-fil-A representative said in a statement to Business Insider on Monday.</p>
      <p>Some people were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-criticized-for-donation-decision-2019-11">quick to slam Chick-fil-A for the decision.</a> Critics included former Republican Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who organized a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day in 2012 after now-CEO Dan Cathy faced backlash for saying he did not support same-sex marriage.</p>

      <p>The criticism fails to acknowledge that Chick-fil-A has done nothing to indicate it will abandon founder Truett Cathy's Christian values. Additionally, the company said on Monday it does not plan to stop donating to faith-based charities.</p>
      <p>Previously, Chick-fil-A worked with the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes to fund youth camps. Looking at the<a href="https://www.chick-fil-afoundation.org/news-events/why-we-give-continuing-the-legacy-of-our-founder"> company's 2019 donations list,</a> it is clear that Chick-fil-A will continue to fund similar projects going forward.</p>
      <p>Rodney Bullard, the head of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-explains-donations-groups-considered-anti-gay-2019-5">told Business Insider earlier this year</a> that the company worked with the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes because the programs were "relevant and impactful in the community." </p>
      <p>"For us, that's a much higher calling than any political or cultural war that's being waged," Bullard said.</p>
      <p>In other words, Chick-fil-A does not want to be a player in this culture war — whether it is embraced by the left or by the right. The company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-chick-fil-a-took-over-america-2019-8">did not collaborate with Huckabee</a> when he launched Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day. It has not worked with any politicians that have argued the company is the victim of anti-Christian hate, such as in the case of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-uk-backlash-highlights-reputations-risk-to-growth-2019-10">Texas Save Chick-fil-A bill</a>. </p>
      <p>Further, Chick-fil-A is not ditching its Christian roots or, as Huckabee says, surrendering to anti-Christian hate groups. <a href="https://www.chick-fil-afoundation.org/news-events/why-we-give-continuing-the-legacy-of-our-founder">Bullard mentions Truett Cathy's legacy</a> as the company's inspiration in a blog post published on Monday. Chick-fil-A will continue to close on Sundays, in keeping with Cathy's faith. And, Chick-fil-A specifically reserved the right to continue to donate to religious organizations on Monday. </p>
      <p>"[T]he Foundation will no longer make multiyear commitments and will reassess its philanthropic partnerships annually to allow maximum impact," Chick-fil-A said in a press release on Monday. "These partners could include faith-based and non-faith-based charities."</p>
