      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets edged higher on Monday, lifting prices of U.S. government debt, as a 90-day extension allowing U.S. companies to do business with China’s Huawei eased the latest spike in investor angst over U.S.-Sino trade tensions.</p>

      <p>The three major U.S. stock indexes set closing highs for a second straight session, while MSCI’s gauge of world equity markets also edged up to less than 1% from a record peak set in January 2018.</p>
      <p>The stock rally reversed early losses sparked by conflicting reports about the outlook for ending the 16-month trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has weighed on global growth and roiled capital markets.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Commerce Department added Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL to an economic blacklist in May, citing security concerns, but has allowed it to purchase some American-made goods in a series of 90-day license extensions.</p>
      <p>Early on Monday, a CNBC report cast fresh doubts on the prospects for phase one of a U.S.-China trade deal, saying the mood in Beijing was pessimistic due to President Donald Trump’s reluctance to roll back tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>
      <p>The report halted rallies in Europe and Asia after Chinese state media Xinhua over the weekend said Washington and Beijing had held “constructive” talks.</p>
      <p>“Progress doesn’t happen in a straight line and that is starting to frustrate people today,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Raleigh, North Carolina. “It feels very herky-jerky.”</p>
      <p>MSCI’s all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS of global stock performance gained 0.15%.</p>
      <p>In Europe, the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.01%, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.FTEU3">.FTEU3</a> of leading regional shares fell 0.04%. Both are trading at four-year highs.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.DJI">.DJI</a> rose 31.33 points, or 0.11%, to 28,036.22. The S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.SPX">.SPX</a> gained 1.57 points, or 0.05%, to 3,122.03 and the Nasdaq Composite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.IXIC">.IXIC</a> added 9.11 points, or 0.11%, to 8,549.94.</p>
      <p>The safe-haven Japanese yen gained and gold prices erased losses to settle slightly higher.</p>
      <p>Investors hope that tariffs the United States and China have imposed on each other’s goods will be rolled back as they are seen as harming global economic growth.</p>
      <p>Overnight in Asia, stocks closed higher.</p>
      <p>Tokyo's Nikkei <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.N225">.N225</a> gained 0.49% and China's blue-chip CSI300 index <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.CSI300">.CSI300</a> rose 0.8% after the People's Bank of China, in a surprise move, said it was lowering the seven-day reverse repurchase rate.</p>
      <p>The dollar index .DXY fell 0.19%, with the euro <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=EUR&amp;destCurr=USD">EUR=</a> up 0.2% to $1.1072. The yen <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=JPY&amp;destCurr=USD">JPY=</a> strengthened 0.09% versus the greenback at 108.69 per dollar.</p>
      <p>The price of benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose 5/32 to push yields down to 1.8152%.</p>
