      <p>Tech giants have come under fire in recent months over their failure to crack down on adverts that spread misinformation amid fears they could unfairly influence elections.</p>
      <p>Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has defended his decision to allow unfiltered political advertising on the social network after Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey announced a complete ban on paid-for political ads.</p>
      <p>Spiegel has now weighed in on the debate, saying his firm allows political ads only after they have been approved by a team of fact checkers.</p>
      <p> “We subject all advertising to review, including political advertising,” he told CNBC. “And I think what we try to do is create a place for political ads on our platform, especially because we reach so many young people and first-time voters we want them to be able to engage with the political conversation, but we don’t allow things like misinformation to appear in that advertising.”</p>
      <p>Snapchat’s parent company Snap posted better-than-expected results for the third quarter last month, securing 210m active users and increasing revenue 50 per cent to $446m (£346.2m).</p>

      <p>However, the firm’s ad business is substantially smaller than those of Facebook and Google.</p>
