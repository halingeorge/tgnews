      <h1>The Patriots are 9-1 and atop the AFC, but Tom Brady isn’t happy</h1>

      <h3>Tom Brady sounded like he was coming off a loss.</h3>
      <p>Angry and frustrated, he was short with his answers. Of course, the Patriots had won, but the offence struggled, and the future Hall of Fame quarterback was not pleased after completing 26-of-47 passes for 216 yards and a 67.3 quarterback rating in New England’s 17-10 win over the Eagles in Philadelphia.</p>

      <p>“Up and down,” Brady said in his brief press conference that lasted under two minutes.</p>
      <p>“That’s what it looks like to me. We could probably do everything better.”</p>
      <p>This was just the 16th time in Brady’s career that he had at least 21 incompletions in a regular-season game. It was the fifth time he had won when that happened, a nod to the Patriots defence’s exceptional play.</p>

      <p>“The strength of our team is our defence and our special teams,” Brady told “The Greg Hill Show” Monday morning on WEEI.</p>
      <p>“So on offence, we’ve just got to take advantage of our opportunities and understand where our strengths lie and try to play to them.”</p>
      <p>The Patriots scored just one touchdown (thrown by Julian Edelman) on a 10-play, 84-yard drive, settling for three field goals, and they produced just five first downs the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, yeah,” Brady said after the game. “I don’t have any more [things to say]. I don’t know.”</p>
