      <p>One artist who's been bubbling right now is King Von. Although he's been often seen alongside <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lildurk/profile">Lil Durk</a>, he's slowly been establishing himself as a great rapper in his own right. The OTF clique in general is filled with some great talent but King Von has been putting in a ton of work lately and he's been gaining more prominence slowly but surely. Over the weekend, he blessed fans with a brand new song and video called, "2 A.M." Adhering to the traditional drill sound, he hops over a frightening instrumental and storms through it with vengeance. "It's 2 a.m., we leavin' the club/ Heard the opps outside," he raps on the hook. "Did 'em dirty now it's hot outside."</p>
      <p>Peep his new track below and keep your eyes peeled for more music from King Von.</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>Call up Chapo, he sendin' them bricks<br/>They ain't blood but they leechin' like tits<br/>Model hoes, they be all on my dick<br/>.223, pack by six, you could pick<br/>When the witness ain't there, it won't stick</p>
