      <h1>Taylor Swift’s Fans Are Ropable At John Mayer &amp; Shawn Mendes For Mocking Her In Shady Vid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:10:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:10</time> by <a rel="author">By Matt Galea</a></address>
      <p>It’s a cardinal rule for <b>Taylor Swift’s </b>followers, whether they be a celeb or a pleb like you and me, that if they support any of Tay’s many, many enemies, they’re officially cut from the squad.</p>
      <p>Swift’s most recent collaborator <b>Shawn Mendes</b> is feeling the wrath of Tay’s loyal legion of fans after filming a video alongside her ex <b>John Mayer</b> that poked fun at her song ‘Lover’.</p>
      <p>In the vid, Mayer (who was famously the source of Swift’s <i>Speak Now</i> breakup bop ‘Dear John’) distorts the lyrics to the title track of her new album.</p>
      <p>“You’re insane. Everyone keeps their Christmas lights up until January. And I go, ‘Can you really?’ Because normally I take my Christmas lights down on December 29,’” he sings.</p>
      <p>The original lyrics went like this: “We could leave the Christmas lights up ’til January. This is our place, we make the rules.”</p>

      <p>Shawn laughed along with him before bringing John back around to his point, which was commenting on Shawn’s verse on the remix.</p>
      <p>But later on, John came back to his Christmas lights commentary and sang, “We can keep the Christmas lights up till January. And then about January 5th, we’ll take the lights down. And then we’ll put ’em in a box and we’ll label that box Christmas Lights. Yeah, we’ll put ’em in the attic until next December.”</p>

      <p>The whole time, Shawn was halfway out of the frame and appeared to be laughing his butt off.</p>
      <p>Not cool.</p>
      <p>Swift’s fans have mercilessly hit back at Mendes for betraying his friend in the shadiest of ways.</p>
