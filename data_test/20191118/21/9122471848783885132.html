      <h1>Lane Kiffin Posts Heartfelt Message For QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:19:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa’s season-ending injury is one of the lone dim moments of what’s been a great college football season. The Alabama quarterback has been such a iconic figure in college football over the past few seasons. The sport won’t be the same without him for the rest of this year.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa’s injury has sparked an outpouring of appreciation and heartfelt messages for the young man. Lane Kiffin, former Alabama offensive coordinator and current FAU head coach, is the latest to offer his love and support for the Alabama quarterback.</p>
      <p>Kiffin posted a simple, yet thoughtful message for Tagovailoa on Monday, via Twitter.</p>

      <p>Kiffin clearly has a special place in his heart for Tagovailoa. After all, the former Alabama offensive coordinator recruited the highly touted prospect out of Hawaii to come to the University of Alabama. It was a no-brainer for the elite prospect.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has since led the Crimson Tide to two national championship appearances, including a title game win over Georgia in 2018. Alabama lost last year’s title game to Clemson.</p>
      <p>The quarterback put up some ridiculous stats this season, throwing for 2,840 yards and scoring 35 total touchdowns with just three interceptions. It was certainly an efficient, productive season for him.</p>
      <p>Backup quarterback Mac Jones will replace Tagovailoa at quarterback moving forward. The Crimson Tide face Western Carolina on Saturday.</p>
