      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- A new book of imagery and poetry celebrates the collaboration of two women who have been friends for more than 40 years.</p>
      <p>Musician Patti Smith and her pal, photographer Lynn Goldsmith, worked together on "Before Easter After" using Smith's words and Goldsmith's photos of the singer -- who has rocked us for almost half a century.</p>
      <p>Smith shared the stage with Bruce Springsteen and Bono to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and she was inducted herself a dozen years ago.</p>
      <p>Goldsmith calls her the paragon of cool.</p>
      <p>"Because she is," she said. "Just look at the pictures."</p>
      <p>We met at Electric Lady Studios in the Village for a brief photo session.</p>
      <p>"I'm from South Jersey, and people from South Jersey are just naturally cool," Smith said. "But it's not something you can aspire to. I guess you are or you're not."</p>
      <p>Smith is a poet who became a rock star, and Goldsmith is a legendary rock photographer. Their work together is its own kind of poetry.</p>
      <p>"She wants the best of you to be magnified," Smith said.</p>
      <p>And this work is a prophecy fulfilled, because Smith once wrote in a poem, "There will be nothing we cannot image and therefore accomplish."</p>
      <p>Their successful collaboration comes down to mutual trust.</p>
      <p>"Not only because she's open to the way I am with my glowing aspects, but also my flaws," Smith said. "And she's going to find the best light for them."</p>
      <p>The best of their work in the 1970s is collected in the new book, which evokes - to borrow more of Smith's words - "a palace of memory."</p>
      <p>"'Before Easter After' is a book that will transport you into a certain period of time," Goldsmith said. "And those years I think not just in New York, but everywhere, were rather special."</p>
      <p>Smith became known as "The High Priestess of Punk," a style of music she once described as "the freedom to be who you are."</p>
      <p>It's a vibe these women, who are both in their 70s now, have never abandoned.</p>
      <p>Smith says Goldsmith takes her out of her comfort zone, and Goldsmith said Smith does the same thing for her.</p>
      <p>They chose the words and images in their new book together, and the result is a meeting of two minds -- as vibrant as when they first wandered the streets of the city together four decades ago.</p>
