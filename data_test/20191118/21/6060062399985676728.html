        <li>In a meeting with WeWork executives, last Thursday, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son said that he wants the company to become profitable by 2021, according to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432191/telecoms-wield-enormous-power-over-the-internet-but-cities-are-fighting-back">Fast Company</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Son reportedly told the executives to find new ways to monetize the hundreds of coworking spaces currently owned by WeWork.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>WeWork's private valuation has plummeted <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/softbank-vision-fund-wework-valuation-5-billion-without-rescue-deal-2019-11-1028669293">more than 80%</a> since its failed IPO, creating pressure on the company to cut costs and identify a more sustainable business model.</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/wework-layoffs.html?searchResultPosition=1">The New York Times</a> reported that the company may lay off more than 4,000 employees as part of its restructuring.</li>

      <p>SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son told a group of WeWork executives in a meeting on Thursday that he wants the company to become profitable by 2021, according to a report from <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432191/telecoms-wield-enormous-power-over-the-internet-but-cities-are-fighting-back">Fast Company's Katrina Brooker</a>.</p>
      <p>Son reportedly said he wants WeWork to better monetize the real estate it already owns by offering new products and services, as the company attempts to identify a sustainable business model following its catastrophic attempt at going public.</p>
      <p>SoftBank, WeWork's largest investor, recently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/softbank-agrees-to-rescue-wework-in-a-bailout-deal-2019-10">agreed to rescue the company</a> through a combination of new financing, stock buybacks, and additional investment. As SoftBank tries to turn WeWork into a profitable company, it has begun exploring new ways to monetize existing office spaces as well as launching a broad cost-cutting effort.</p>
      <p>WeWork <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weworks-third-quarter-earnings-show-high-growth-strategy-2019-11">lost $1.3 billion in the third quarter</a>, despite adding a record number of desks, according to an earnings presentation reviewed by Buiness Insider.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Claure, the SoftBank-appointed Chairman of WeWork, told WeWork employees on Monday <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-chairman-tells-employees-layoffs-will-begin-this-week-2019-11">to expect layoffs this week,</a> according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider. The New York Times reported on Sunday that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/wework-layoffs.html?searchResultPosition=1">job cuts cold affect more than 4,000 employees</a>.</p>
      <p>The increased pressure comes as <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/softbank-vision-fund-wework-valuation-5-billion-without-rescue-deal-2019-11-1028669293">SoftBank cut its valuation</a> of WeWork by 83% and posted an $8.8 billion investment loss last quarter for its Vision Fund I.</p>
      <p>Representatives from WeWork and SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Â </p>
