        <b>A number of Arsenal fans have taken to Twitter to react to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-offer-granit-xhaka-borussia-20896461">reports from the Daily Mirror over the weekend suggesting</a> that the Gunners may use Granit Xhaka in an attempt to boost their chances of signing Denis Zakaria.</b>

      <p>Xhaka’s future at the Emirates looks to have a huge question mark hanging over it. He has not played for Unai Emery’s men since lashing out at the fans as he left the field during the draw with Crystal Palace.</p>

      <p>It appears that he could be on the way out of the club in January. The Daily Mirror reports Borussia Monchengladbach are among the clubs chasing the Swiss.</p>
      <p>And it seems that that has prompted Arsenal to consider using Xhaka’s potential departure to boost their hopes of landing a new signing.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-offer-granit-xhaka-borussia-20896461">The Mirror suggests</a> that a number of sides want Zakaria. But Arsenal are hoping that they can reach an agreement that would see Xhaka return to the Bundesliga outfit, with the Gunners landing the first refusal on the 22-year-old if he is going to be sold next summer.</p>
      <h3>Popular move?</h3>
      <p>And it appears that the Arsenal supporters on social media are in favour of that sort of agreement. Plenty have lauded Zakaria, and feel that he is exactly the kind of player who could be a fantastic signing.</p>
      <p>And it seems that many would happily see Xhaka sold to help pave the way for his international teammate to arrive at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Some have their doubts that Zakaria would be keen to replace Xhaka given what has gone on. But it is clear that many Arsenal fans would love to see Zakaria join the club at some stage in the future.</p>
      <p>Here is how some of the Gunners fans made of the reports on Xhaka and Zakaria’s futures…</p>
