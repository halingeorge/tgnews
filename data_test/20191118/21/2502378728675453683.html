      <h1>Kris Jenner and Lisa Rinna Filmed A '90s-Style Infomercial For Kim Kardashian's Skims</h1>

      <h3>"I mean, we can actually breathe and be perky at the same time. You don't want sweet chariots to swing low!"</h3>
      <p>Kim Kardashian has enlisted the help of her mother Kris Jenner as well as two of her friends, <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </i>stars Kyle Richards and Lisa Rinna, to promote her shapewear line <a href="https://skims.com/">Skims</a>. The three women have filmed QVC-style infomercials for the brand, which includes Rinna <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO5fp9FQ_qk">stripping down to her "solutionwear"</a> to show off just how great this innovative product is!</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>According to a statement from Skims, the new videos honor Jenner's past in infomercials. During her pre-<i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> days, Jenner promoted everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfryT0E65SA">a stair climber</a> with then-husband Caitlyn Jenner to $99 sets of "health and wellness" candles <a href="https://www.insider.com/video-kris-jenner-magic-candles-infomercial-2017-7">with psychic Linda Salvin</a>. Detox tea could never.</p>
      <p>Rinna is also no stranger to the infomercial game. She's been selling her Lisa Rinna Collection on QVC <a href="https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/846124/lisa-rinna-s-fashion-line-is-more-than-a-trend-how-the-real-housewives-star-found-huge-success-on-qvc">since 2011</a> and is frequently seen filming for the network on episodes of <i>Real Housewives</i>. Naturally, the three women are very comfortable sitting on a couch together to discuss Kardashian's latest business venture, and boy, do they know how to sell.</p>
      <p>"I mean, we can actually breathe and be perky at the same time," Jenner said about the line's sculpting bra. "You don't want sweet chariots to swing low!"</p>
      <p>She has a point.</p>
