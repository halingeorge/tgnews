      <p>The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education on Monday declared the examination timetable for HSC (Class XII) and SSC (Class X) exams, which will be held from February to March next year.</p>

      <p>“The timetable published on the board’s website is only for reference,” a statement by the State board said. “The final timetable will be made available through hard copies that will be sent to schools and colleges. The State board has requested the students to refrain from searching for the timetable on other portals, or from trusting any viral information shared on WhatsApp or related mediums. The timetable for practical exams, internal and oral exams will be declared by the board a few days before the exam.”</p>
      <p>This year, oral exams of English and Social Sciences have been reintroduced for SSC applicants, whereas the paper pattern for HSC papers of Physics, Chemistry, Math and Biology has been modified. Speaking to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, secretary Ashok Bhosale said, “We have almost completed the processes of developing school profiles by the way of assessment and to help students with its geo-tags. We are in talks regarding the use of information effectively for students.”</p>
