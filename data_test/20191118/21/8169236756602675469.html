      <p>Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi quickly let Arsenal man Lucas Torreira know that it wouldn’t be easy to bring him down in tonight’s clash between Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
      <p>In the 21st minute of the tie, Messi showcased his extraordinary talent to beat several Uruguay players with some fantastic skill and silky dribbling.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old simultaneously tricked Matias Vecino and Edinson Cavani with a pinpoint turn. The superstar then used a burst of pace to charge past Arsenal’s Lucas Torreira.</p>
      <p>The combative midfielder attempted to bring the forward down but was ultimately left on the floor after Messi displayed his amazing balance.</p>
      <p>This wasn’t the end of the ace’s stunning run, he used a lovely roulette to get past Martin Caceres before passing the ball.</p>
