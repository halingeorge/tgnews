      <p>Police were in a Derby street last night after a person died.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derbyshire-police">Derbyshire police</a> said there had been a sudden death at a property in Merchant Street, off Ashbourne Road.</p>
      <p>They said no crime had taken place, but the force attended so it could report the death to the coroner.</p>
      <p>The coroner mainly receives reports about deaths from the police, doctors and medical referees.</p>
      <p>Derbyshire Live received messages on Sunday at around 3.45pm about the police presence in the street.</p>
      <p>One resident said there were two marked vehicles and an unmarked police van parked up.</p>
      <p>The resident, who did not wish to be named, said there were no sirens as police approached the property.</p>
      <p>Our reporter who went to the scene said there were two police vehicles in the street when she arrived.</p>
