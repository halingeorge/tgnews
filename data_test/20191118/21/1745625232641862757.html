      <p>The longtime CBS host is back after a two-week social media silence.</p>
      <p>Julie Chen Moonves is killing it with clues about <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/big-brother/">Big Brother</a>.</i> After a two-week Instagram break, the veteran CBS host posted yet another cryptic teaser about the long-running reality show, once again sending fans into a frenzy over the possibility that a special wintertime season is on the way.</p>
      <p>On her Instagram page, Chen posted a photo of herself holding a large pink card that says “Big Brother” on it. The wife of former CBS CEO Les Moonves is wearing black shorts and a striped t-shirt as she shakes the cardboard sign back and forth in a teasing manner. Her perfectly manicured fingernails and large diamond rings are also in view.</p>
      <p>In the caption to the post, Chen wished her followers a happy Monday and added an eyeball and winky-face emoji.</p>
      <p>Several past <i>Big Brother</i> players, including veteran Paul Abrahamian, posted reaction to Chen’s photo in the comment section of the post. In response to Abrahamian posting the eyeball emoji, a follower wrote, “If you get a third shot I’m suing.”</p>
      <p>Abrahamian famously landed as runner-up two seasons in a row on <i>Big Brother</i>, in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p><i>Big Brother</i> veterans Corey Brooks, Da’Vonne Rogers and James Huling also reacted with eyeballs and more to Chen’s post. <i>Big Brother</i> 16 winner Derrick Levasseur accused Chen of “trying to break” Instagram.</p>
      <p>Other <i>Big Brother</i> fans begged for some breaking news about an upcoming all-stars or celebrity season of the show.</p>
      <p>“WINTER ALL-STARS?! PLEASE!!!!” one fan wrote.</p>
      <p>“Man she is killing us with these clues,” added another of Chen’s teasers.</p>
      <p>While Chen has still not explained why she posted a <i>Big Brother</i>-related photo in the middle of November — the regular season of the show airs from June to September — the consensus among <i>Big Brother</i> fans is that something big is happening well before next summer.</p>

      <p>Chen’s new post comes a few weeks after she teased fans with photos of her dressed as memorable <i>Big Brother</i> veterans, including Abrahamian, <i>Big Brother All-Stars</i> winner Mike “Boogie” Malin and <i>Big Brother</i> 16’s Zach Rance. Chen also unearthed Nicole Franzel’s frog costume that she had to wear as a punishment during one of her two seasons on the CBS reality show. Chen’s dress-up game caused many fans to believe she was teasing another all-stars season, as previously shared by <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5724684/julie-chen-big-brother-all-star-rumors/">The Inquisitr</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Although fans are hoping to see Chen and the <i>Big Brother</i> house well before next June, there is some concern over the fact that there <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5746552/cbs-winter-schedule-no-big-brother/">is no sign</a> of a winter edition of the show in any format on CBS’ recently-released winter 2020 schedule.</p>
