      <h1>‘Stolen’ Banksy statue could get $1.3M at Sotheby’s auction</h1>

      <p>A Banksy statue is up for auction and expected to sell for over $1 million — but the identity of its rightful owner is in question.</p>
      <p>The anonymous artist’s “The Drinker,” a riff on Auguste Rodin’s 19th-century “The Thinker” statue, was first installed in a small square off London’s Shaftesbury Avenue in March 2004 without official permission, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/apr/02/art">the Guardian reports</a>. The following month, rebel art collective Art Kieda took the traffic cone-hatted installation and moved it to the garden of group leader Andy Link (also known as AK47).</p>
      <p>“I did it as a bit of a stunt, a bit of a prank,” Link <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/banksy-drinker-sale-intl-scli/index.html">tells CNN</a>. He insists the statue was “abandoned and dumped” by Banksy, and after removing it, Art Kieda attempted to return the statue to the English street artist. Link even contacted the police to see if it had been reported stolen or lost.</p>
      <p>Link kept it in his garden until 2007, when all but the traffic cone disappeared. He registered the piece as stolen on an art theft registry.</p>
      <p>In 2014, a new owner acquired the piece with a fresh traffic cone added to its head, <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/banksy-sculpture-reimagines-rodin-in-homage-to-the-thinker">according to Sotheby’s</a>. A documentary called “The Banksy Job,” which tells the story of the statue’s many owners and Link’s feud with Banksy, came out two years later.</p>
      <p>Now, “The Drinker” is once again getting a new owner. Sotheby’s will <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2019/contemporary-curated/banksy-the-drinker">hold a live auction</a> for the statue — which “is accompanied by a Pest Control certificate” — on Tuesday. Its estimated worth is between $971,000 and $1.3 million.</p>
      <p>Link argues, however, the statue is rightfully his and that he has police documents to prove it. London’s Metropolitan police tell CNN there is no active criminal investigation into the case.</p>
