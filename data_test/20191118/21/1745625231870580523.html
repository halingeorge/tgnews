      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/nicole-scherzinger/">Nicole Scherzinger</a> took to her popular Instagram page to share a sexy video of herself lounging on a pool raft in style. As those who follow the former Pussycat Doll on Instagram know, Nicole is no stranger to flaunting her killer figure in a wide range of NSFW outfits, including bikinis and other sexy swimwear. In the most recent video that was shared on her page, Scherzinger sizzled in one of the hottest swimsuits to date.</p>
      <p>In the caption of the image, Scherzinger told fans that she was promoting Tubi, a free streaming service that is similar to Netflix. The video started off with the singer floating around in a pool while showing off her sculpted figure. While clad in a sexy orange swimsuit that featured a lace-up front, the singer’s killer legs were also on display. The 41-year-old accessorized her look with gold earrings and a long, gold necklace.</p>
      <p>She wore her long, dark locks down and slightly wet while stunning in a gorgeous application of makeup that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and lipstick. In the short clip, the television personality chatted with a therapist in the pool as she explained that she was done with the drama before going on to plug Tubi.</p>
