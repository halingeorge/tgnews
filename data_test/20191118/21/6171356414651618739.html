      <p>The Versa 2 is the pinnacle of Fitbit's hardware endeavors. It blends the beauty of a sophisticated smartwatch with the fitness tracking reputation Fitbit has been cultivating since coming onto the scene nearly a decade ago. For a limited time, you can wrap a brand new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TWFVDWT?tag=androidpolice-20">Fitbit Versa 2 around your wrist for up to 25% off with this Amazon offer</a>.</p>
      <p>The Versa 2 features all the great health tracking features you've come to expect from Fitbit devices, like step counts, heart rate measurements, and sleep tracking. Voice-activated Alexa support is on board to help you carry out various tasks. The Versa 2 is also water-resistant up to 50 meters, so you don't have to worry about getting your watch wet in the shower, bath, pool, or even when playing in the snow this winter.</p>
