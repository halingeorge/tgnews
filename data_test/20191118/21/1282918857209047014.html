      <p>Filled with compassion, Cancerians are known to be sentimental. They unconditionally spread love and soak in the energies of the surroundings, making them prone to grasping negativity. They are highly sensitive and intuitive. With a big heart, Cancerians are amongst the first ones to offer helping hand. Most of you tend to create a boundary and rejoice their time in solitude. While they understand you in a jiffy, it takes much longer for them to get their true self out and expose in front of you. </p>
      <h3>Daily horoscope- 19 November 2019</h3>
      <h3>Love</h3>
      <p>You are everywhere and nowhere in your relationship. There have been no real central points for a long time, and the world fascinates your partner more than you. So, be frank with yourself and talk frankly about what went wrong and where the two of you were running out of steam! Try to address the underlying issues and work with your partner to solve them.</p>
      <h3>Family and friendship</h3>
      <p>In your private life, you will have to put up with unpleasantness, being constantly asked to take a stand on uncomfortable disputes. There may be some choices that cause you a lot of pain. Try to see this process as an opportunity to grow inside. You'll be productive if you find the right way to do it.</p>

      <h3>Health</h3>
      <p>You should take responsibility because you don't always feel good for yourself. When you can't keep up with others and have less stamina than you expect, it's not a big deal. Instead of forcing yourself too hard and running the risk of exhaustion, listening to your body's cues and taking a short break is safer.</p>
