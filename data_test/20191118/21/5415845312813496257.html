      <h2>Unai Emery is desperately searching for the right combinations within his Arsenal side. As the pressure intensifies and the need for change grows, here the top three players he must get the best out of to rescue his reign.</h2>

      <p>Things are not going very well for <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> and <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=unai+emery">Unai Emery</a>. Just two points from their last four games, just four league wins all season, and only 24 points from their last 19 games dating back to the end of last season. And amidst it all, a slew of players not performing to their potential because of the positions they are being put in. Emery must begin to get the best out of his team, otherwise he will face the consequences.</p>

      <p>And so, here are three players that Emery needs to see the best of in the coming weeks if he is to save his job.</p>

      <h3>3. Lucas Torreira</h3>
      <p>With Granit Xhaka seemingly exiled from the squad after his calamitous end to his captaincy, the opportunity to use<a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=lucas+torreira"> Lucas Torreira</a> as a destructive presence at the base of the midfield has presented itself. A central midfield with Torreira as the anchor alongside Dani Ceballos and Matteo Guendouzi seems like a natural trio to move forward with. And yet, Unai Emery has been extremely hesitant to use it.</p>
      <p>In particular, his management of Torreira is extremely curious. While the Uruguayan excels in breaking up play with his terrific athleticism and snappy tackling, Emery seems to believe that he is better used in more advanced positions, despite his limitations in possession. Torreira does instigate the high press well, his energy infectious throughout the team, but it is fairly obviously not the best use of his talents.</p>
      <p>Even more pertinently, Arsenal collectively have struggled to control games, especially in central midfield areas. By using Torreira as a primary ball-winner, Emery would aid his team by providing them with greater opportunities to win and then control the possession. However, thus far, Emery has been willing to use Torreira in this manner. It is hurting both the team and his tenure.</p>
