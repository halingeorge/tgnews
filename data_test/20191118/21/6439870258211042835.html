      <h1>Power Cross Ministries coach accused of allowing, watching fight between young boys</h1>

      <p>SALISBURY, N.C. (WBTV) - A coach with Power Cross Ministries in Salisbury was charged with misdemeanor child abuse after police say he allowed two young boys to fight and watched.</p>
      <p>The investigation began in September when the mother of a 10-year-old boy told police her son was beaten up by an 11-year-old boy while they were both attending activities offered by Power Cross.</p>
      <p>According to the Salisbury Police Department, the 10-year-old had witnessed a previous fight between some older boys and a coach with Power Cross, 24-year-old Anthony Darnell Shegog, asked him why he didn’t report it.</p>
      <p>The arrest warrant states Shegog asked the 10-year-old, “What if I just watch you get into a fight?”</p>
      <p>That’s when detectives say Shegog went to the 11-year-old boy and told him to get answers about the previous fight from the 10-year-old. The 11-year-old then went into an office with the younger boy and punched him several times while Shegog watched through a window.</p>
      <p>The fight, which officials say was captured on video, lasted about two minutes before Shegog walked in and the older boy left.</p>
      <p>Shegog was charged on Saturday. He is due in court on December 11.</p>
      <p>There is no word on Shegog’s current status with Power Cross Ministries.</p>
