      <p>“<i>If you loved the classics Night of the Creeps, Critters, Dead Heat, Ghoulies, They Live and Gremlins then you’re in for a real treat</i>,” the makers of the upcoming horror film <b><i>Creatures</i></b> promise, and today they’ve unleashed early poster art for the film along with word that the old school-style, practical effects-heavy creature feature will be releasing <b>Christmas 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>The action/sci-fi/horror-comedy comes from the director of <i>Cute Little Buggers</i> (<b>Tony Jopia</b>), the executive producer of <i>The Hive</i> (Romain Barbey), the creator of <i>Good Tidings</i> (Stu Jopia), and the puppet creation team behind “The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance” (Stitches and Glue).</p>

      <blockquote>“A group of astronomy students get more than they bargained for after finding an injured alien who is being targeted by a group of bloodthirsty alien creatures.”</blockquote>
