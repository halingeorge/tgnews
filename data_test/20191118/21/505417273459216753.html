      <h1>Player Ratings As Spirited Ireland Draw With Denmark In Dublin</h1>

        <b>The Republic of Ireland 1 Denmark 1.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ireland have failed to qualify directly for Euro 2020 and will need to come through a Nations League play-off next March after failing to beat the old enemy Denmark in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s side were aggressive, spirited and committed, and the Danes did not, by any means, set the world alight at the Aviva Stadium, but they could only record a 1-1 draw. Martin Braithwaite opened the scoring before Matt Doherty’s equaliser sparked a grandstand finish to the game. However, unfortunately, Ireland could not find a winner and will now have to go through a play-off in a few months.</p>
      <p>Here is how we rated the Ireland players:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Darren Randolph – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Middlesbrough goalkeeper has been Ireland’s most consistent performer for at least two years. Randolph has saved Ireland on several occasions and boosted their chances of qualification by returning from injury for the visit of the Danes. He was rarely tested on Monday night, with the Danes often mirroring Ireland by playing direct.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Matt Doherty – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Doherty got his chance at right-back due to Seamus Coleman, Ireland’s captain, being suspended. Earning just his ninth cap, the Wolves wing-back was defensively sound for most of the match, winning his fair share of aerial challenges. In the second half, we saw more of his natural game going forward. He went on one impressive run, taking a couple of Danes out of play before passing to space, and was a calm presence on the ball. A solid display that was almost marred when he switched off for the Danish goal. He redeemed himself with an excellent back-post header to set up a frantic finale to the game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shane Duffy – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Duffy, who captained Ireland for the first time on Monday night, was the only Irish player to score against the Danes in the team’s five previous matches over the last two years.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Derry-native opened the scoring in the 5-1 drubbing in November 2017 and rescued a point for McCarthy back in June with a brilliant header in the dying stages of the Euro 2020 qualifier in Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, however, Duffy’s main contribution was at the back. In the first half, the Brighton defender made a stunning block to prevent Christian Eriksen’s powerful shot from finding the target and kept both Danish strikers – Andreas Cornelius and Kasper Dolberg – under wraps. He was undoubtedly Ireland’s best performer of the opening period and was, once again, the team’s best chance of finding the net.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, he appeared to switch off for the Denmark goal, but he had kept his team in the game until then.</p>
      <p>
        <b>John Egan – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Sheffield United defender only cemented his international starting spot due to Richard Keogh’s serious injury, but he has arguably improved the backline. Egan has been brilliant for his club in the Premier League this season and was a solid presence on Monday night. Denmark’s attacks were often rudimentary – the team appeared to be primarily looking to pick up second balls and get possession to Eriksen – but Egan coped well with the threat the team posed. Substituted at half-time, after picking up a calf injury during a collision with Cornelius.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Enda Stevens – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another player in excellent club form coming into the game, Stevens was among Ireland’s best players on the night. The Sheffield United left wing-back was tidy in possession and defensively sound, sniffing danger on a few occasions to stifle Danish attacks before they could pose a threat to Darren Randolph. He set up Ireland’s equaliser with a wonderful cross to the back post.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Glenn Whelan – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whelan was given a difficult task on the occasion of his 91st cap for Ireland – keep Christian Eriksen quiet and he largely succeeded. The Hearts midfielder started brightly. In the later stages of the match, Whelan faded and couldn’t get close to his opponents and was slow to react in the buildup to the Danish goal. But e has been a great servant to the Irish team and covered more ground than one could reasonably expect of a player a few months shy of 36.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jeff Hendrick – 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Burnley midfielder had a mixed game. He started well and was full of energy, often acting at the team’s first defender, but offered little in possession and faded as the game went on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conor Hourihane – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hourihane was dropped for Ireland’s last competitive match – the 2-0 loss to Switzerland in Geneva last month – but returned to the team on Monday night. The Aston Villa midfielder was on the edge of the game, with the disjointed nature of the match unsuited to his skillset. He also missed the team’s best chance of the first-half, hitting a tame effort on goal after collecting a misplaced pass. However, he was always going to be key for Ireland in the game due to his set-piece deliveries, and he hit some stunning passes just after half-time – one, in particular, that would have resulted in a goal had any of the players in the box touched it. Replaced with 23 minutes to go by Callum Robinson, a stange move given Hourihane had began to find his range with his deliveries.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alan Browne – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The only surprise inclusion in the starting XI, Browne played on the right side of midfield. An athletic player, with an eye for goal, the Preston North End midfielder was up to the task of playing there, but his selection suggested Mick was playing it safe to start with – especially considering Callum Robinson’s goal against New Zealand. Browne came close with a dipping shot in the first half, but was generally on the fringes of the match.</p>
      <p>
        <b>James McClean – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Stoke City winger earned his 72nd cap on Monday night and gave his best Ireland performance for some time. His passing and deliveries were still wayward, but McClean won the ball back several times, often high up the pitch, and kept the Danes occupied by hassling the opposition. He improved as the match went on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David McGoldrick – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>After missing the Ireland matches last month, McGoldrick’s return to the team was a massive boost for McCarthy. The Sheffield United forward may not be the most prolific goalscorer, but he knits the team together with his intelligent movement and clever link-up play. He often made something out of what seemed like nothing passes, finding space between the lines and out wide. Not as effective after half-time, as Ireland struggled to create openings.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>Substitutes</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ciaran Clark – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Defensively sound after coming on at half-time and made one impressive last-ditch tackle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum Robinson – 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robinson arguably should have started and showed his quality with a wonderful cross for McGoldrick late in the game as Ireland chased an equaliser.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sean Maguire – 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Keen to make an impression but not on the pitch long enough to affect the game.</p>
