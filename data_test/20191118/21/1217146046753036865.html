      <p>Security Summit partners including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US tax industry, and several state tax agencies published security guidance and updated content to highlight identity theft precautions to be taken during the incoming holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>Individual and business taxpayers, as well as tax professionals, are advised to boost their security defenses against potential identity theft attempts that will soon surface during the holidays.</p>
      <p>"While people are shopping online, identity thieves are trying to shoplift their sensitive information. As the holiday season and tax season approach, everyone should remember to take basic steps to protect themselves," IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said. </p>
      <p>"The Security Summit has made progress in fighting back against tax-related identity theft, but we need people to watch out for common scams that can put their financial and tax data at risk."</p>
      <h3>Identity theft safeguards and protection measures</h3>
      <p>The US tax collection agency provides businesses with an updated 'Security Awareness For Taxpayers' PDF document during this month's National Tax Security Awareness Week, ready to share with employees, clients, and customers</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/security-summit">Security Summit</a> members also recommend taking the following measures to protect personal and financial information online:</p>
      <p>• Use security software for computers and mobile phones – and keep it updated.<br/>• Protect personal information; don't hand it out to just anyone.<br/>• Use strong and unique passwords for all accounts.<br/>• Use two-factor authentication whenever possible.<br/>• Shop only secure websites; Look for the "https" in web addresses; avoid shopping on unsecured and public WiFi in places like shopping malls.<br/>• Routinely back up files on computers and mobile phones.</p>
      <p>As part of the Tax Security Awareness Week, the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/security-summit-marks-4th-national-tax-security-awareness-week">IRS will also provide basic steps</a> for easily recognizing email and phone scams, detecting identity theft attempts, and creating strong passwords for online accounts.</p>
      <p>Videos with <a href="https://youtu.be/V3hdiCtKj5s">Easy Steps to Protect Your Computer and Phone</a> and on how to <a href="https://youtu.be/Hm8TAU_ErEE">Avoid Phishing Emails</a> are also provided by the IRS and its Summit partners with additional information for taxpayers on how to augment their security.</p>
      <h3>Security plans and malware warnings</h3>
      <p>In July, the IRS issued a joint news release with the Security Summit partners to remind professional tax preparers of <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tax-professionals-warned-by-irs-to-create-data-security-plans/">their obligation to have a data security plan</a> in place with appropriate safeguards to protect sensitive taxpayer information from data theft attacks.</p>
      <p>The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also provides a <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST06-008">Safeguarding Your Data</a> Security Tip issued through the National Cyber Awareness System.</p>
      <p>One month later, an IRS warning alerted taxpayers and tax professionals of an <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/irs-warns-taxpayers-of-new-scam-campaign-distributing-malware/">active IRS impersonation scam campaign</a> that used spam emails to deliver malicious payloads.</p>
      <p>The security guidance the IRS will share during the National Tax Security Awareness Week is designed to help both taxpayers and tax pros to defend against attacks such as those that are targeting the tax season with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/realistic-phishing-attacks-take-advantage-of-us-tax-season/">realistic phishing emails</a> bundling malicious attachments.</p>
      <p>Attackers are also known to use <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-of-phones-scams-pretending-to-be-the-irs/">phone scams</a> as observed in 2016 when they posed as IRS representants and asked their targets to extinguish outstanding debts of thousands of dollars via gift card payments.</p>
