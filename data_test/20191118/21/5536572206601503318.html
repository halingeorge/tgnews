      <h1>Patriots Got Away With Obvious Missed Offsides Call on Opening Series That Held Eagles To FG (PIC)</h1>

      <p>Some teams seem to really catch all the breaks. Some more than others, like the Patriots…</p>
      <p>That was the case during Sunday’s matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots when the opening drive for the Eagles stalled out after left tackle Jason Peters was called for a false start.</p>
      <p>Upon further review, it seems a Patriots player was lined up in the neutral zone, but refs missed it and Peters found himself getting caught instead.</p>

      <p>That 2nd-and-3 turned into a 2nd-and-8 and the drive would eventually turn into a field goal.</p>
      <p>Missed calls like that can switch the outcome of the game as the final score was 17-10 in favor of the Patriots.</p>
      <p>The Pats defense should still be given credit for dominating the way they did.</p>
