      <p>Famous Portuguese football ace Cristiano Ronaldo has apparently come up with a way to reconcile with his teammates at Juventus who were somewhat discomforted by his conduct during the recent match with Milan.</p>
      <p>During the game, Ronaldo reportedly called the team manager Maurizio Sarri a "son of a whore" after being substituted, and left the stadium before the match, which Juventus won 1-0, was over.</p>
      <blockquote>And now, it seems that the footballer intends to smooth things over by inviting all of his fellow team members to dinner, which will likely take place sometime this week, according to La Repubblica.</blockquote>

      <p>​CR7 also admitted that he “played at a slightly reduced capacity” during the last three weeks, and that he’s still not "100 percent".</p>
      <blockquote>"But when it comes to sacrificing myself for my club and my national team, I do it with pride”, he added.</blockquote>
      <p>As news of this development hit social media, some netizens seemed to appreciate Ronaldo’s move.</p>
