      <p>1. <b>Ben has known Cassidy since they were kids.</b> Prior to officially revealing her daughter’s engagement, Kathie dropped a few hints to <a href="https://www.accessonline.com/articles/kathie-lee-giffords-daughter-cassidy-is-engaged-see-her-gorgeous-ring"><i>Access Hollywood</i> </a>that her 26-year-old daughter would be getting a ring on her finger in the near future. “Cassidy’s probably going to get engaged pretty darn soon too, I got a feeling,” she teased to the outlet. “They’ve known each other since they were 11 and 14, so it’s good. It’s a happy time for us.”</p>
      <p>2. <b>He’s college educated</b>. Ben attended Pepperdine University in Malibu, California from 2009-2013. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in International Management.</p>
