      <p>MILAN, N.M. (AP) — A dozen Cuban asylum-seekers detained in a New Mexico say they have repeatedly been placed in solitary confinement for going on hunger strikes.</p>
      <p>The Santa Fe New Mexican reports two asylum-seekers in federal immigration custody said they and 10 others were put in solitary confinement twice as punishment for protesting their lengthy stay in prison.</p>
      <p>The men are being held at the privately run Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, New Mexico.</p>
      <p>Juan Carlos Peña Pavon told the newspaper he spent nine days in solitary confinement.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old Peña Pavon is part of a group of detained asylum-seekers that last month staged sit-ins at Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman at Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s El Paso field office did not respond to an email.</p>
