      <p>NAVAJO NATION, AZ â€” The Navajo Generating Station, located near the Arizona-Utah border, has officially shut down after using the last of its coal, according to a Monday press release.</p>
      <p>The NGS was a 2,250-megawatt plant that is owned by SRP, Arizona Public Service Co., Nevada Energy and Tucson Electric Power.</p>
      <p>It was determined in 2017 that the station was "uneconomical" to continue operations, according to officials. They argued that the plant polluted the air and caused health problems in communities nearby.</p>
      <p>"NGS will always be remembered as a coal-fired workhorse whose employees made it one of the safest and most reliable power plants in the nation," said SRP CEO and General Manager Mike Hummel in a statement. "After more than 40 years of generating electricity for millions across the West, NGS - and its employees - are one reason why this region, the state of Arizona and the Phoenix metropolitan area have been able to grow and thrive."</p>
      <p>The lease for the plant was set to expire this December, and officials say the next step is to decommission activities in the plant.</p>
      <p>All 433 regular employees at the plant have been offered new positions within SRP and nearly 300 have accepted these offers, according to an official statement.</p>
      <p>The plant is located in northern Arizona, near Page.</p>
      <p>Company officials say it wasn't an easy choice to close the plant but the decision was based on the changing economy of the energy industry, including gas prices.</p>
