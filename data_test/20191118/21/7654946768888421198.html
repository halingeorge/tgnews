      <h1>Liuba Grechen Shirley won’t run for Peter King’s seat, cites pregnancy</h1>

      <p>Democrat Liuba Grechen Shirley — who gave longtime Long Island Rep. Peter King <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/02/this-working-mom-is-giving-peter-king-the-toughest-race-of-his-career/">a run for his money in the 2018 elections</a> — announced on Monday she won’t be running for his soon-to-be vacated congressional seat, citing her pregnancy.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old political newcomer <a href="https://twitter.com/liuba4congress/status/1196510193993035776">said in a video on Twitter</a> that it would be too difficult to run for congress in 2020, with a 1-year-old, 3-year-old and another baby due in April.</p>
      <p>“I cannot run in such an important race unless I am certain I can put 100 percent in,” said Grechen Shirley.</p>
      <p>After King, the 14-term Republican leader of New York’s congressional delegation, announced in November <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/longtime-new-york-rep-pete-king-wont-seek-re-election/">that he wouldn’t seek re-election</a> in 2020, Grechen Shirley said she was considering taking another stab at his seat.</p>
      <p>Grechen Shirley in 2018 challenged the GOP lawmaker — who represents the 2nd District, which includes Nassau and Suffolk counties — and the incumbent <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/07/long-island-rep-peter-king-hangs-on-to-house-seat-barely/">beat her by just six points</a>. But she made him work for that win, raising nearly $924,000, almost four times King’s $238,000.</p>
      <p>And she made history in the process, convincing the Federal Election Commission to allow her to use campaign funds to pay for childcare.</p>
      <p>“As a  mom of a 1-year-old and 3-year-old on the campaign trail, running was also one of the hardest things I’ve done,” Grechen Shirley said Monday.</p>
      <p>“Our political system is not set up for moms with young children, which is why I had to fight to become the first mom in history to spend campaign funds on childcare.”</p>
      <p>It’s also why Grechen Shirley said she launched Vote Mama, a national organization that aims to support and get progressive moms elected.</p>
      <p>Grechen Shirley vowed to keep “fighting for moms on the campaign trail” so that “more moms, and even pregnant moms can run.”</p>
      <p>She signed off with a jab at her former opponent, telling King that “as your political career comes to a close, I hope you find the bipartisan bravery you were so often falsely applauded for and I urge you to support the impeachment and removal of the president.”</p>
