      <p>Apple continues to push out iOS and iPadOS updates at a swift pace.</p>
      <p>iOS 13.2.3, the latest update, solves several strange bugs that appeared in the mobile operating systems following the release of iOS 13. For example, the update includes a fix for the Spotlight filter that makes it work more consistently on an operating system level, as well as across Apple’s Mail, Files and Notes.</p>
      <p>Further, apps that download content in the background have been fixed, along with Mail now fetching emails correctly. Apple’s update notes also mention that a problem causing photos, attachments and links to not display correctly in the Messages app has been solved.</p>

      <p>Since its release, iOS 13 has been a mess in some respects, but it’s great to see Apple releasing updates at a rapid rate. iOS 13.3 is currently being tested in both developer and public betas.</p>
      <p>You can download iOS 13.2.3 by navigating to ‘Settings,’ then ‘Genera,’ ‘About,’ and finally ‘Software Update.’</p>
