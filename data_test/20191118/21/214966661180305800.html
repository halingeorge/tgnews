      <p>It’s time to race to the fuel pump again today, with prices already beginning a whopping 50c jump per litre.</p>
      <p>The RACQ has warned that the unleaded price is trending upwards, though some servos have already spiked through the roof.</p>
      <p>On the Gold Coast, prices are already as high as $1.75 a litre, after selling for only $1.25 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Luckily, some servos are still pumping for under $1.30, though it’s not certain how long that will last.</p>
      <p>Prices will likely remain high through to the end of the week.</p>
