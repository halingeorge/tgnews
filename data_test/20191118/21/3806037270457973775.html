      <h1>Chick-fil-A Ends Donations to Two Anti-LGBTQ Organizations</h1>
      <h2>Donations will cease going to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and The Salvation Army.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:33:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:33</time> by <a rel="author">Gabrielle Leung</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/chick-fil-a">Chick-fil-A</a> announced today that it will no longer donate to the <a href="https://www.fca.org/">Fellowship of Christian Athletes</a> and <a href="https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/">The Salvation Army</a>, two organizations that have been criticized by LGBTQ advocates. Back in 2012, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-explains-donations-groups-considered-anti-gay-2019-5">CEO Dan Cathy said</a> that the American fast-food company supported “the biblical definition of the family unit,” further stating that it was “prideful” and arrogant” for individuals to redefine marriage. While Chick-fil-A stopped donating to other controversial groups that year, it continued to fund specific programs for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and The Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>Both organizations have been accused of being anti-LGBTQ and have taken controversial stands on same-sex marriage. FCA’s <a href="http://fcaaustin.org/Websites/fcaaustin/files/Content/1538783/FCA_Student_Leader_Application.pdf">employee application</a> includes a “Sexual Purity Statement” that reads, “Either heterosexual sex outside of marriage nor any homosexual act constitute an alternative lifestyle acceptable to God,” while the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/business/chick-fil-a-lgbtq-donations/index.html">Salvation Army has stated</a> that the scripture does not support same-sex marriages.</p>
      <p>From now on, Chick-fil-A will cease donations to these organizations, a decision that has spurred both support and backlash. “We made multiyear commitments to both organizations, and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018,” a representative <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-ending-donations-criticized-by-lgbtq-activists-2019-11">told Business Insider</a>. “Moving forward you will see that the Chick-fil-A Foundation will support the three specific initiatives of homelessness, hunger and education.”</p>
      <p>For 2020, the company is growing its partnerships with Junior Achievement USA and Covenant House International, while donating $25,000 USD to a local food bank after each new Chick-fil-A restaurant is opened. The company has continued to expand in recent years, becoming the third-largest chain in the U.S. by sales, according to the <a href="https://www.nrn.com/data-research/top-200-restaurants">Nation’s Restaurant News</a>.</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/kelloggs-glaad-all-together-cereal-anti-bullying-campaign-lgbtq">Kellogg’s joined LGBTQ+ media advocacy organization GLAAD’s anti-bullying campaign with six “All Together” cereals</a>.</p>
