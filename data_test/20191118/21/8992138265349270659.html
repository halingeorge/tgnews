      <h1>CLS Group Reports Slight Decline in October FX Volumes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:09:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:09</time> by <a rel="author">Aziz Abdel-Qader</a></address>
      <p>Foreign exchange settlement provider CLS Group reported its operational metrics for October 2019, which moved higher on a yearly basis, but its executed trade volumes were lower compared with the <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/execution/cls-defies-market-trend-reports-solid-fx-trading-in-september/">figures of the prior month</a>.</p>
      <p>Average daily traded volume submitted to CLS was $1.79 trillion in October 2019, down 3.2 percent month-over-month from $1.84 trillion in September. Across a yearly timetable, the figure reflected an advance by four percent relative to October 2018’s figure of $1.71 trillion.</p>
      <p>CLS reported <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/execution/cls-launches-same-day-fx-gross-pvp-settlement-service-clsnow/">swaps volumes</a> at $1.27 trillion in October 2019, down from $1.34 trillion in September 2019, a fall of five percent month-over-month. However, the figure was higher by a factor of ten percent year-over-year from $1.161 trillion a year ago.</p>
      <p>In terms of CLS’ spot FX volume, the group has reported the figure at $415 billion in October 2019, up 2.2 percent relative to $406 billion in the month prior. The figure was lower by 12 percent over a yearly basis from the $471 billion set in the previous year.</p>
