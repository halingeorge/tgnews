      <p>Three people have been killed at a Walmart in Oklahoma, with sources claiming a husband shot dead his estranged wife, her new boyfriend, and self before a stranger intervened.</p>
      <p>A police chief has confirmed that two men and a woman have been fatally shot outside the store.</p>
      <p>Two victims were shot inside a car and the third was in the parking lot outside the store in Duncan, Police Chief Danny Ford said.</p>
      <p>According to TNN television, Capt. Ford said the shooting took place in a parking lot in front of the store and the suspect is one of those killed.</p>

      <p>Police said in a Facebook post that a handgun was found at the scene.</p>
      <p>A Walmart spokesperson said that none of its employees was involved in the shooting.</p>
      <p>LeMia Jenkins says the shooting on Monday morning in the parking lot outside the store in Duncan was “an isolated incident and was not an active shooter situation.”</p>
      <p>Schools in the area had been placed on lockdown temporarily before being given an “all clear” by local police, according to a Facebook statement from Duncan Public Schools.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place shortly before 10am on Monday (3am AEDT), police said.</p>
      <p>Police are looking for witnesses to the shooting, Capt. Ford said.</p>
      <p>According to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, a man wearing all black opened fire outside the Walmart in Duncan at 10am local time.</p>

      <p>A dispatcher said that “everyone is at the scene.”</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail reported that a man shot and killed his estranged wife and her new boyfriend before turning the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>An armed citizen intervened in the domestic dispute, according to the newspaper, which says that family members were at the scene.</p>
      <p>Officers from the Duncan Police Department said the wife and her boyfriend were found dead inside their car.</p>
      <p>Duncan is about 130 kilometres south of Oklahoma City. The town has a population of about 22,000.</p>
      <p>It is the city where Australian baseballer Chris Lane was shot and killed six years ago.</p>
      <p>The close-knit community still struggles to come to terms with why three teenagers would randomly select Lane, shoot him in the back and leave him to die on the side of a residential street.</p>
      <p>Mr Lane’s murder took place just a short drive from the Walmart.</p>

      <p>At the time the community and local enforcement were shocked by Mr Lane’s death, with violent crime in the city rare.</p>
      <p>They randomly spotted Lane, a 22-year-old from Melbourne who had a scholarship to study and play baseball at Oklahoma’s East Central University, jogging along a street.</p>
      <p>A then 16-year-old Chancey Luna was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for first degree murder.</p>
      <p>Michael Jones, 17, who was driving the car, was sentenced to life but could be eligible for release after 38 years.</p>
      <p>His 15-year-old friend James Edwards entered a guilty plea to an accessory to murder charge and had 10 years of his 25-year sentence suspended.</p>

      <p>On August 3, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius killed 22 people and injured 24 others at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas.</p>
      <p>Police believe a manifesto with white nationalist and anti-immigrant themes, posted on the online message board 8chan shortly before the attack, was written by Crusius.</p>
      <p>It cited New Zealand’s Christchurch mosque shootings and a right-wing conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement as motivation for the attack.</p>

      <p>Another Walmart store in Mississippi was the scene of a shooting in July, when a disgruntled employee killed two co-workers and wounded a police officer.</p>
      <p>In the El Paso shooting, Crusius said he had launched the deadly attack in response to what he called a “Hispanic invasion” of Texas.</p>
      <p>Walmart said in the wake of the two shootings inside its stores within a week of each other that it would limit sales of guns and ammunition.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, police in Fresno, California, said that four people were shot dead and six others wounded on the weekend during a shooting at a gathering in a backyard to watch a football game.</p>
      <p>Last week, two students at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita were killed by 16-year-old Nathaniel Berhow after he opened fire as school began.</p>
