      <p>Paris - <b>Alex Marquez</b> will ride alongside his older brother and six-time MotoGP world champion <b>Marc</b> at Honda next season, the team announced on Monday.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Alex Marquez, who added the Moto2 world title this year to the Moto3 crown he won in 2014, has signed a one-year deal with the constructors' champions.</p>
