        <i>• Club have 24 points deducted with 12 suspended for two years<br/>• Taunton pitch found to be ‘not the best quality’</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset">Somerset</a> have been handed a 12-point deduction for next season’s County Championship after being found guilty of breaching pitch regulations.</p>
      <p>A Cricket Discipline Committee Disciplinary Panel ruled against the county over the poor state of the pitch for their match against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/sep/25/county-cricket-somerset-v-essex-title-decider-day-four-live">Essex at Taunton in September</a>. The rain-affected Division One match ended in a draw that handed Essex the championship title.</p>
      <p>Somerset’s full punishment is a 24-point deduction, of which 12 are suspended for two years. They have 14 days to appeal against the decision.</p>
      <p>Following an investigation Somerset were charged with a breach of the regulation which requires that: “Each county shall actively seek to prepare the best quality cricket pitch that it can for the match that it is staging.”</p>
      <p>Somerset accepted a pitch rating of “poor” was correct but pleaded not guilty to a second element of the charge that the Taunton surface “was not the best quality pitch that Somerset was able to prepare for the match”.</p>
      <p>A statement on the club’s website said: “Somerset await the full report from the cricket discipline commission before considering our next course of action.”</p>
