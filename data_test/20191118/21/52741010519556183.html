        <b>Companies in the news:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Canadian National Railway. (TSX:CNR). Down 18 cents to $123.76. About 3,200 Canadian National Railway conductors, trainpersons and yard workers could go on strike just after midnight tonight in a job action that would affect freight services if a deal isn't reached with the company. Passenger rail services in the country's three biggest cities would not be affected, the union said. The Teamsters Canadian Rail Conference, the union representing the employees, gave the required 72-hour strike notice on the weekend. The union said it hopes to reach an agreement before the deadline to address safety and scheduling issues, but workers are prepared to walk off the job if their expectations aren't met.</p>
      <p>Aimia Inc. (TSX:AIM). Up 30 cents or 8.3 per cent to $3.93. Aimia Inc. has reached a deal with a group of dissident shareholders to overhaul its board of directors, ending a drawn-out fight over control of the company. The agreement also includes a plan by the company to buy back up to $125 million worth of Aimia's shares by Dec. 30. The deal marks a partial surrender to the group led by Charles Frischer, who had sought to overthrow half of Aimia's eight-member board, and to Philip Mittleman, the company's largest shareholder who was locked in a court battle with Aimia. All of the company's directors excluding Mittleman and chief executive Jeremy Rabe have confirmed they will not stand for election to the board at the company's 2020 annual meeting, to be held before May.</p>
      <p>Western Forest Products Inc. (TSX:WEF). Down four cents or 3.1 per cent to $1.23. Western Forest Products Inc. says negotiations with the United Steelworkers union representing workers in a long-running coastal B.C. strike ended without resolution on the weekend. The company says no active negotiations are occurring and no future mediation dates have been scheduled after 14 hours of bargaining occurred on Saturday and Sunday supervised by two independent mediators. CEO Don Demens says the mediators informed the company talks were over after it presented a contract offer. The strike which began July 1 affects about 3,000 coastal forest workers employed in Western Forest Products' sawmills and timberlands operations.</p>
      <p>Barrick Gold Corp. (TSX:ABX). Up 42 cents or 1.9 per cent to $22.33. Shares in Barrick Gold Corp. rose on Monday after the company announced plans to sell its 50 per cent non-operating interest in an Australian gold mine for US$750 million in cash. The deal to sell its stake in Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines in Western Australia — which includes the country's largest open pit gold mine, The Super Pit, as well as underground and processing works — to Australian gold miner Saracen Mineral Holdings Ltd. was announced on Sunday.</p>
