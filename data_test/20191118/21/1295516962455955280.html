      <h1>Justice League: Former WB Pres. Supports Snyder Cut, Hints It's Unfinished</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:11:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author">L.D. Nolan</a></address>
      <p>Former DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment President Diane Nelson, who stepped away from those roles in 2018, has expressed her support for a version of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/justice-league-film/">Justice League</a> more faithful to original director Zack Snyder's vision, while indicating that cut may not be finished.</p>
      <p>Posting her own #ReleaseTheSnyderCut to <a href="https://twitter.com/dewnelson1/status/1196227881019432960">Twitter</a>, Nelson included an exchange with podcaster Tim Yoko. In the message, Nelson wrote, "If Zack feels he had the time and resources to finish a cut to his satisfaction and he would like fans to see it, nothing would make me happier than for him to have that opportunity. He earned it and was not only a great filmmaking talent, but a true gentleman and professional in all his dealings with the Studio and DC."</p>

      <p>The production process for <i>Justice League </i>was infamously troubled, and the movie ultimately failed to meet expectations at the box office. After Snyder left <i>Justice League </i>following a family tragedy, director Joss Whedon was called in to complete reshoots that reportedly gave the film a lighter tone. Rumors of a Snyder Cut of <i>Justice League </i>quickly began gaining traction online, and several people involved with the production, including Snyder himself, have publicly discussed that version of the movie. Some, like <i>Aquaman </i>star Jason Momoa, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-jason-momoa-snyder-cut/">claims to have seen the Snyder Cut</a>, though exactly what state that version of the film is in remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Next up for the DC Extended Universe is Cathy Yan's <i>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</i>, slated for release Feb. 7, 2020; Patty Jenkins' <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>, coming June 5 2020; James Gunn's <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, which arrives August 6, 2021; and Matt Reeves' solo <i>Batman </i>film, which will swing into theaters June 25, 2021.</p>
