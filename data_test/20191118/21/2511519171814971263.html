      <h1>The Walking Dead is coming to an end, report claims</h1>
      <h2>The show's comic book source material came to an end in July</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:23:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Stolworthy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-walking-dead"><i>The Walking Dead</i></a> will reportedly end in a few seasons time due to the source material <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/the-walking-dead-comic-book-final-issue-194-ending-what-happens-carl-sophia-andrea-a8986386.html">drawing to a surprise close</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The zombie drama, which airs in the US on network AMC, is midway through its 10th season, but according to sources close to the show, it will end with its 12th in March 2022.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/walking-dead-ending-after-season-12/"><i>We Got This Covered</i></a> claims that franchsie overseer Scott Gimple will focus on spin-off series <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fear-the-walking-dead"><i>Fear the Walking Dead</i></a>, which is on its sixth season.</p>
      <p>A second spin-off, focused on a group of teenagers caught up in the apocalypse, will begin next year.</p>
      <p>Last year, a t<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/walking-dead-movie-andrew-lincoln-rick-grimes-helicopter-trailer-release-date-a9013516.html">rilogy of films centred on Andrew Lincoln’s character Rick Grimes</a> was announced. Lincoln left the show midway through <i>The Walking Dead</i>’s ninth season.</p>
      <p>The news was followed by the announcement that <i>Black Panther</i> star Danai Gurira, who has played Michonne on the show since season three, will <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/danai-gurira-the-walking-dead-exit-season-10-michonne-a8770956.html">leave next year</a>.</p>
      <p>“The current thinking at AMC is to do two more seasons of <i>The Walking Dead</i> before bringing things to a close and focusing on the spin-offs,” the report reads.</p>
      <p>“While the show that started it all may be winding down, there’s still a lot of gas left in the tank for the property overall.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about his decision to pull the plug on the comic book source material, creator <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-end-finish-final-season-12-robert-kirman-comics-a7501826.html">Robert Kirkman</a> said: “I got to tell my story exactly how I wanted to and end it on my terms, with no interference at all along the way... at any point."</p>
      <p><i>The Walking Dead</i> began in 2010. Its current cast includes Norman Reedus, Melissa McBride, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Samantha Morton as the villainous Alpha.</p>
      <p>The latest episode saw the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-season-10-episode-7-siddiq-death-scene-dante-whisperers-spy-alpha-a9206811.html">shock death of a character</a> at the hands of someone who’s revealed to be one of Alpha’s spies. </p>
      <p><i>The Walking Dead </i>is broadcast Mondays on FOX in the UK and is available to stream on NOW TV</p>
