      <h1>Pompeo: US to soften its position on West Bank settlements</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:14:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author">Bob Fredericks</a></address>
      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday the US will soften its position on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>Pompeo said that establishment of settlements was not inconsistent with the law, and that President Trump would no longer abide by a 1978 State Department legal opinion that the settlements were “inconsistent with international law,” he said.</p>
      <p>The move is likely to be welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to anger the Palestinians, as well as other countries seeking to resolve the Middle East conflict.</p>
      <p>Pompeo’s remarks from the White House were the third major instance in which Team Trump had sided with Israel and against stances taken by the Palestinians and Arab states.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and, in 2018, the US formally opened an embassy in the city.</p>
      <p>US policy had previously been that the status of Jerusalem was to be decided by the parties to the conflict.</p>
      <p>And in March, Trump recognized Israel’s 1981 <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/16/netanyahu-renames-golan-settlement-as-trump-heights/">annexation of the Golan Heights</a> in a boost for Netanyahu that prompted a sharp response from Syria, which once held the strategic land.</p>
      <p>Trump’s move could help Netanyahu as he struggles to stay in power.</p>
      <p>Israeli politics is <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/18/benjamin-netanyahu-remains-in-tight-race-with-challenger-after-israels-repeat-election/">deadlocked after two inconclusive elections</a> this year. Former military chief Benny Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party emerged neck and neck with Netanyahu following a September vote, and both leaders have struggled to put together a ruling coalition.</p>
