      <h1>This playlist of the worst songs to have sex to is delightfully cursed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:41:25+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/anna-iovine/" target="_blank">Anna Iovine</a></address>
      <p>On Monday, a sex playlist went viral on Twitter:</p>
      <p>But it's not just any Spotify-curated sex playlist, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWVGy1YP1ojM5?si=tLZPd9LmQIKxmQRbXqDCkw">Silk Sheets</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1BGjF5N5O7F?si=dyg8pAtDQV2p81OF3VHWkQ">Sexy as Folk</a>. This playlist is called the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7FUiUFzuZIAVsiBs8Db7oa?si=oHeukvHPT2OH-zpwJWbjOQ">"worst songs to have sex to,"</a> and its name is pretty apt. Highlights include: "Peanut Butter Jelly Time," "Everything is AWESOME!!!," and the<i> Law &amp; Order</i> theme song.</p>

      <p>While the playlist appears to have been created in 2018 — two days after Valentine's Day at that — new songs have been sporadically added. "The original playlist actually started from an article that I saw (I can’t even remember the media platform) that talked about the top 10 worst songs to have sex to," said Veronica, a student in Pittsburgh who created the playlist. "In my head, I was like 'Oh there are way worse' so I started the playlist with those few and started to add to it." It's now amassed to being 6 hours and 9 minutes long...nice.</p>
      <p>The tag line of the playlist is "have YOU done the challenge," insinuating that fornicating to jams such as "Cotton Eye Joe" and "My Shiny Teeth and Me" is all part of an ironic sport. According to Veronica, the playlist was initially created only for parody — but friends who helped make it took it to another level.</p>
      <p>"Some of my friends who helped make it started a 'challenge' to be as serious as you can while having sex, and then they would text me the song that made them break into laughter," she said. </p>
      <p>It wasn't Veronica's intention to make a viral playlist, but she doesn't mind. She said, "I’m glad I’m making people laugh." Personally, I think the playlist can use a few additions, the 'Succession' theme song being at the top of the list. </p>
