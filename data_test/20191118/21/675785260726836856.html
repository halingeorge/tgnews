      <h1>Luis Enrique set for Spain return for Euro 2020 with Robert Moreno stepping aside</h1>
      <h2>Luis Enrique stood down earlier this year due to personal circumstances with his long-time No.2 leading Spain through the remainder of qualifying unbeaten</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:35:34+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/luis-enrique">Luis Enrique</a> looks set to make an emotional return as Spain boss to lead La Roja at next summer’s European Championships.</p>
      <p>Current boss Robert Moreno, who was Enrique’s No.2 before the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> boss stepped down from the role earlier this year, is set to move aside despite leading the side unbeaten through qualification.</p>
      <p>Enrique, who only took charge after the 2018 World Cup, walked away from the job to focus on his family, after discovering his daughter Xana was suffering from bone cancer.</p>
      <p>He kept his daughter's illness quiet until August, when the family announced that she had died at the age of nine.</p>
      <p>Moreno, who is well liked by Spain's senior stars, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/spain-coach-robert-moreno-makes-19339261">stated in September</a> that, if Enrique wanted to return, he would happily step aside for his close friend.</p>

      <p>"I consider Luis a friend and ahead of everything is friendship," Moreno, who had acted as assistant to Enrique previously at Roma, Celta Vigo and Barcelona, said.</p>
      <p>"If one day he wants to return, I would be delighted to take a step to the side and work with him.”</p>
      <p>On Monday night, a matter of hours before Spain thrashed Romania 5-0 at Atletico Madrid’s Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, <a href="https://www.cope.es/deportes/futbol/futbol-seleccion/noticias/robert-moreno-sentara-banquillo-seleccion-eurocopa-luis-enrique-muy-cerca-volver-20191118_554273">Cope</a> reported that the Spanish Football Federation had already contacted former boss Enrique over a potential return at next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>Spain beat Romania comfortably in Madrid, thanks to goals from Fabian Ruiz, Gerard Moreno (2), Mikel Oyarzabal and an own goal from Adrian Rus.</p>

      <p>Moreno has won seven and drawn two of his nine games in charge.</p>
      <p>He insisted ahead of the clash with Romania that he wasn't bothered about speculation over his future.</p>
      <p>"[I have] No need to sit down with Rubiales, nor [sporting director Jose] Molina, who are the people who trust me and I trust," said Moreno.</p>
      <p>"I give more value to what they tell me privately.</p>
      <p>"They have always told me everything they had to say to me. I did not expect any more roundness from the president."</p>
      <p>Also on Sunday however, RFEF chief Luis Rubiales refused to confirm any long-term plans involving Moreno stating: "When qualification is completed next week, we will reflect on the situation,” he said.</p>
      <p>"We are very happy with Robert, and that has not changed. Once the tournament is completed we will look again at the matter."</p>
      <p>However, Moreno did not give his post match press conference on Monday evening nor give any interviews, suggesting he is far from happy with either the handling of the situation or the timing.</p>
