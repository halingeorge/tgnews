      <p>Here’s what pony car lovers need to know about the Ford Mustang Mach E.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a completely electric offering from the automotive company.</li>
        <li>It’s not a muscle car but is instead an SUV.</li>
        <li>The starting price for the vehicle is $43,895.</li>
        <li>Other variants, such as the First Edition, Premium or GT, cost more.</li>
        <li>The range on the battery is 300 miles on a single charge.</li>
        <li>Ford is also saying the SUV can go from 0mph to 60mph in the mid-five-second range.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Ford Mustang Mach E is a strange offering to be sure. It’s not a sports car, but yet it retains the Mustang logo. Here’s what <b>Twitter</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/twtr-stock-quote/"><b><u>TWTR</u></b></a>) users are <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MustangMachE&amp;src=typeahead_click">saying about the SUV</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“I don’t know what to call this fugly thing, but it sure as hell isn’t a Mustang. Way to wreck a legendary brand @Ford #MustangMachE.”</li>
        <li>“Welcome to the death of the Mustang. Such a shame. #MustangMachE is a #fail.”</li>
        <li>“As an owner of a 1966 Ford Mustang I feel like I have the right to say the new #MustangMachE is not a muscle car. Concept is cool but why a sedan?”</li>
        <li>“It’s not a mustang, it’s marketing stunt for an electric Escape, it’s bullshit. #MustangMachE”</li>
        <li>“How to ruin a legend in 3,2,1… #MustangMachE.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>F stock closed out the day Monday largely unaffected by the Mustang Mach E announcement.</p>
