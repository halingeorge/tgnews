      <p>KIRKSVILLE, Mo. â€” Plans are continuing to move forward to enhance a business incubator space in Kirksville.</p>
      <p>During a meeting Monday night, the incubator, which is named <a href="https://www.mreic.org/kirksville-business-incubator/">Square 1</a>, was a topic for city council members.</p>
      <p>Square 1 serves as a place where local entrepreneurs, business owners and students can network and collaborate.</p>
      <p>The incubator space is located at 315 South Franklin Street in the basement of the city owned Economic Development Alliance Building.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.mreic.org/">Missouri Rural Enterprise and Innovation Center</a>, or MREIC, was awarded a grant from the Missouri Technology Corporation to improve the existing incubator space.</p>
      <p>The improvement project will include the addition of private work areas along the north wall of the incubator.</p>
      <p>During Monday's meeting, council was asked to approve a resolution approving a bid from J.D. Custom Contractors, now Boyer Construction, to complete the work.</p>
      <p>That approval came with a unanimous vote.</p>
      <p>According to council documents, city staff solicited bids on three separate occasions with no bids received the first two times the project was advertised.</p>
      <p>The third attempt, yielded two bids, one from J.D. Custom Contractors, and the other from Tiger Development.</p>
      <p>J.D. Custom Contractors submitted the low bid of $19,000. Justin Tilman, the owner of J.D. Custom Contractors, called the day after bids were submitted stating his business had been purchased by Boyer Construction, who has agreed to honor that bid.</p>
      <p>City staffers say the funding for this project comes from the State of Missouri Building Entrepreneurial Capacity Grant Program.</p>
      <p>MREIC was awarded a total of $38,400 for this project, which also includes the purchase of equipment and furnishings for the space.</p>
      <p>The City of Kirksville is responsible for providing in-kind support of $13,000 toward the project with $8,000 in-kind and $3,000 to $5,000 cash.</p>
