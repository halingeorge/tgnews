      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> bosses have made it even harder for the famous camp mates to enjoy a nice meal.</p>
      <p>Not only are they fed a rationed diet of rice and beans until they earn treats by completing Bushtucker trials, their new fire is another challenge.</p>
      <p>The hungry celebs are banned from using an open camp fire this series for the first time ever, due to bush fires which are raging through Australia.</p>
      <p>Instead, they have been given a replacement gas fire, but they have to pump the gas themselves and it won't work until they've earnt enough.</p>
      <p>In tonight's episode, radio DJ <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/roman-kemp">Roman Kemp</a> noticed that the gas has gone from the fire.</p>

      <p>Former Girls Aloud star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/nadine-coyle">Nadine Coyle</a> explained in the Bush Telegraph: “So you’d think it would be great to have a gas cooker in camp but actually it’s not as easy as you’d think.</p>
      <p>"You have to go down and pump the gas yourself which is difficult, harder than it sounds.”</p>
      <p>Nadine and radio presenter <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/adele-roberts">Adele Roberts</a> went to pump some gas for the fire, pumping together until the indicator reached the level marked full.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week the Mirror told how there had been a total fire ban in New South Wales across the state because of dozens of bush fires.</p>
      <p>Whilst the situation is changing on a daily basis, ITV decided to make their decision and bring in an alternative for the camp, which is in Murwillumbah in the north east of the state.</p>
      <p>An ITV spokesman confirmed: “In light of the current situation in Australia, I'm A Celebrity will not feature an open camp fire.</p>

      <p>"Instead, campmates will cook their food and boil their water on a specially made gas stove.”</p>
      <p>A source on set said: “With the current situation with the terrible bush fires that Australia is experiencing and having closely monitored the situation over the past few days, producers thought that it would be appropriate not to have an open fire in camp and so have decided to replace it with a gas stove.”</p>
