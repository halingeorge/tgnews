      <h1>In-demand attacker says that Everton and Liverpool have snubbed him 'three or four times'</h1>
      <h2>Young Scouse star Joe Gelhardt has been linked with a transfer to both Everton and Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:21:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/chris-beesley/" target="_blank">Chris Beesley</a></address>
      <p>In-demand Scouse wonderkid Joe Gelhardt of Wigan Athletic claims that Everton and Liverpool have both rejected him on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>The Blues and Reds are among a clutch of Premier League teams – including Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur – supposedly chasing the 17-year-old's signature according to a weekend report from <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-join-man-utd-liverpool-20897626">the Daily Star</a> .</p>
      <p>Gelhardt, 17, who grew up in Netherton and attended Chesterfield High School in Crosby, has played six times for the Latics in the Championship this season and netted his first senior goal in their 2-2 draw at Hull City on September 14.</p>
      <p>The forward has been a prolific scorer for England's junior national sides though and has registered on 19 occasions in 27 outings for the Three Lions' Under-16s, Under-17s and Under-18s teams and also captained the latter twice last month.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://wiganathletic.com/news/2019/november/Joe-Gelhardt-It-s-a-great-privilege-to-play-for-this-club--1/">Latics TV</a> , as cited by <a href="https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/11/18/joe-gelhardt-claims-everton-and-liverpool-have-snubbed-him-three/">HITC</a> , Gelhardt, who has just signed a new contract at the DW Stadium, said: “I've been at this club since the age of 10, it's nearly eight years in February that I've been making my way through the Academy.</p>
      <p>“The first thing I want to do is thank all of the staff at the Academy. They've taught me everything coming up as a young player. I've got to thank all of my family as well, they've supported me growing up, so we're all over the moon that I've committed my future to this club.</p>
      <p>“I'm always training my hardest and playing my best for my family, they're my motivation, so signing the contract with my Mum sat next to me was a great experience.</p>
      <p>“I've had eight years here, but before I joined the club, I was rejected three or four times by local teams like <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> .</p>

      <p>“The experience I've had at Wigan on the way up the age groups has been really good, but I've had to work very hard for it.</p>
      <p>“It's a great privilege to play for this club. I enjoy coming into work every day, it's a great environment.</p>
      <p>“I love working with all of the staff and the senior players have always been very welcoming.</p>
      <p>“The fans have given me a big boost with their messages of support. I just like being here, which is why I've extended my contract.</p>
      <p>“It's a big confidence boost when I hear the fans singing my name, it gives me that extra percentage and I want to do my best for the fans when I play. The fans are great. I love the fans.”</p>
