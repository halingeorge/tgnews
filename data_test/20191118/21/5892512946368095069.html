      <p>You know the old saying about being careful what you wish for.</p>
      <p>Former light heavyweight contender Ilir Latifi, previously <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/11/13/13619614/new-ufc-rankings-denver-rodriguez-korean-zombie-mma">ranked in the Top 5 at 205 pounds</a>, will try his luck at heavyweight after back-to-back losses against Volkan Oezdemir and Corey Anderson, the former of which ended by way of knockout.</p>
      <p>His first assignment?</p>
      <p>None other than heavyweight power puncher and <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20961468/latest-ufc-rankings-update-zabit-volkov-improve-following-victories-moscow-mma">No. 5-ranked contender</a> Derrick Lewis, a fan-friendly but otherwise odd pairing for the promotion’s upcoming event on Feb. 8, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28109216/sources-ufc-close-finalizing-derrick-lewis-ilir-latifi">ESPN</a>, at a city and venue to be named.</p>
      <p>Lewis (22-7, 1 NC) rebounded from consecutive losses against Daniel Cormier and Junior dos Santos to score a hard-fought split-decision win over Blagoy Ivanov at the UFC 244 pay-per-view (PPV) event earlier this month in New York City.</p>
      <p>Beating Latifi (14-7, 1 NC), who holds 10 finishes in 14 wins, doesn’t do a whole lot for his place in the heavyweight title hunt, but I don’t think anyone will care — even Lewis — so long as this fight provides the fireworks we all think it can.</p>
      <p>We’ll find out in just over two months.</p>
