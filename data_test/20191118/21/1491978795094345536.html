      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen">Yemen</a>’s Houthi rebels have hijacked a boat towing a South Korean drilling rig, a Riyadh-led coalition has said, with a global shipping tracker calling it a Saudi-flagged vessel.</p>
      <p>Sunday’s incident in the Red Sea follows a lull in Houthi attacks on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia">Saudi Arabia</a> as one Riyadh official said the kingdom had established an “open channel” with the Iran-backed rebels.</p>
      <p>“On Sunday, during the sailing of the tugboat Rabigh-3 in the southern Red Sea, it was hijacked and subjected to armed robbery by terrorist elements affiliated to the Houthi militia,” the coalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki said.</p>
      <p>“The boat was towing a [marine rig] owned by a South Korean company,” Maliki said in a statement posted on the official Saudi press agency.</p>
      <p>The statement did not say which country the vessel belonged to or how many crew members were onboard. Maliki did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment.</p>
      <p>Yemen’s prime minister, Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, tweeted that a “Korean ship and two accompanying boats” had been seized by the rebels, condemning the move as a “dangerous escalation”.</p>
      <p>According to the tracking website Marine Traffic, Rabigh-3’s home port is in the western Saudi city of Jeddah and it sails under the kingdom’s flag.</p>
      <p>The head of the rebels’ supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed al-Houthi, acknowledged the Houthis had seized a vessel, in what he called a “suspicious case” off the Yemeni coast.</p>
      <p>“The Yemeni coastguard is doing its job to determine whether it … belongs to the aggressors or to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea">South Korea</a>,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>“If it is for South Korea, they will be released after legal procedures … we assure everyone not to worry about the crew.”</p>
      <p>News of the hijacking came as Saeed returned to the southern city of Aden on Monday for the first time since being forced out by southern separatists in August.</p>
      <p>Aden has become the seat of government after the leaders were driven out of Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, in 2014 by the Houthi rebels.</p>
      <p>Saeed’s return follows a Saudi-brokered deal with the separatists this month, which observers said could pave the way for a wider peace deal in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen">Yemen</a>.</p>
      <p>The Houthi rebels have been fighting Yemen’s internationally recognised government and its allies for more than four years in a war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine.</p>
      <p>A year after the Iran-backed Houthis seized Sana’a, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their allies intervened in the conflict in support of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi.</p>
      <p>Since 2015, tens of thousands of people – most of them civilians – have been killed in a conflict that has triggered what the UN has described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p>
