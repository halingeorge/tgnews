      <p>HBO has released the first trailer for their sci-fi satire comedy<b><i> Avenue 5</i></b>. The project comes from <i>Veep </i>creator <b>Armando Ianucci </b>and while the series doesn’t deal with politics, it does poke fun at high society and their entitled behavior.</p>
      <p><b>Hugh Laurie</b> stars as the captain of a luxurious space cruise ship named Avenue 5. The captain loves his job… but when something happens to the ship and he’s stuck on it with all of the annoying socialites, his job becomes a nightmare. These are the kind of people that need answers immediately from the person in charge. So, I guess in the distant future when we are able to take space cruises, nothing changes with how people act.</p>
      <p>The project also stars <b>Josh Gad</b> as Herman Judd, the billionaire who is behind the Avenue 5. Everything he owns has pretty much been branded with his name. The rest of the cast includes <i>Silicon Valley</i> star <b>Zach Woods</b>; <b>Nikki Amuka-Bird</b> (<i>The Personal History of David Copperfield</i>); <b>Rebecca Front</b> (<i>The Thick of It</i>); <b>Lenora Crichlow</b> (<i>Being Human</i>); <b>Suzy Nakamura</b> (<i>Veep</i>); and <b>Ethan Phillips</b> (<i>Veep</i>).</p>
      <p>This looks like it’s going to be a great and entertaining series and you can check out the trailer below. <i>Avenue 5</i> will premiere sometime in January 2020 on HBO.</p>
