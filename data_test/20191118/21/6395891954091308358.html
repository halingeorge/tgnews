      <p>According to an <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/file/windy-cocaine">arrest affidavit</a> filed by the Fort Pierce Police Department, Zak was pulled over by authorities at 11:40 p.m. Oct. 30 when he failed to stop at an intersection.</p>
      <p>Police said Zak made movements in an attempt to throw something away from the vehicle's center console, the affidavit said.</p>
      <p>According to the arrest affidavit, a search of the sedan Zak was driving revealed a crack pipe in the center console and a clear baggie filled with a white substance, <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/florida-man-claims-wind-blew-cocaine-into-his-car-police">WPEC</a> reported. Police said the substance tested positive for crack cocaine, according to the <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/file/windy-cocaine">arrest affidavit</a>.</p>
      <p>According to police, Zak said the baggie did not belong to him, asserting the "police or the wind must have placed it there," the <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/file/windy-cocaine">affidavit </a>said.</p>
      <p>Police charged Zak with possession of paraphernalia Oct. 31, and he was taken to the St. Lucie County Jail, <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/florida-man-claims-wind-blew-cocaine-into-his-car-police">WPEC</a> reported. He is expected in court Dec. 3.</p>
