      <p>While there are new fighters introduced with each successive <i>Mortal Kombat</i> game, some characters stand the test of time and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477749/mortal-kombat-writer-struggled-deciding-which-characters-to-include?pv=search">become mainstays</a> of the fighting game franchise. Major Jackson “Jax” Briggs is one of those characters, having appeared in most of the series’ entries following his debut in <i>Mortal Kombat II</i>. Now Jax is headed to the big screen in the theatrical reboot of the property and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478737/mortal-kombat-an-updated-cast-list?pv=search"><i>Mortal Kombat</i></a> screenwriter Greg Russo is teasing that he has ‘big plans’ for the character. Take a look:</p>

      <p>In director Simon McQuoid’s <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, <i>Supergirl</i> actor Mehcad Brooks will portray Jax. He may play James Olsen and the Guardian <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476899/mehcad-brooks-is-heartbroken-over-leaving-supergirl-in-season-5?pv=search">on <i>Supergirl</i></a>, but he is sporting a Superman-esque physique for his role in <i>Mortal Kombat</i>. The actor’s physical transformation was noted by a fan on <a href="https://twitter.com/WriterRusso/status/1194875527766532096">Twitter</a> and caught the attention of <i>Mortal Kombat</i> screenwriter Greg Russo, who offered the slightest tease of what we can expect from Jax.</p>
      <p>Greg Russo is impressed with Mehcad Brooks’ dedication to the role of Jax that is on display with the actor’s carved from granite physique. Fortunately, it sounds like all that hard work won’t be for naught because Greg Russo has big plans for the character of Jax in the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> film. What those plans are he doesn’t say exactly, but it sound like Jax will definitely have something to do and will potentially play a significant role in the film.</p>
      <p>That would be a departure from the first <i>Mortal Kombat</i> film from 1995, where Gregory McKinney appeared in a small role. Jax was recast with Lynn Williams in <i>Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</i> and in the <i>Mortal Kombat: Rebirth</i> short film and the <i>Mortal Kombat: Legacy</i> web series, the character was played by Michael Jai White. But for Jax fans it sounds like the upcoming movie will potentially give the character his best cinematic appearance yet.</p>
      <p>What that will be we don’t yet know. Although the story varies from game to game, the character of Jax is generally portrayed as a Special Forces officer or the leader of the Outer World Investigation Agency. Greg Russo refers to him as the Major here so it sounds like the new <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, which <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480376/set-photo-reveals-james-wans-mortal-kombat-movie-is-officially-filming">is now filming</a>, will be keeping Jax’s story as some sort of officer working for the military or some sort of governmental agency.</p>
      <p>In the Special Forces, Jax was Sonya Blade’s director superior, so one imagines that if that story is maintained or if they are partners, the film will feature him taking on the forces of evil alongside Jessica McNamee’s Sonya Blade and hopefully duking it out with nemesis Kano-- who will be played by Josh Lawson.</p>
      <p>Either way, Mehcad Brooks is looking jacked to play Jax. And while Jax is usually depicted as clean-shaven or with a beard, it looks like <i>Mortal Kombat</i> may be going in a slightly different direction as the actor is sporting a serious cop mustache here. Greg Russo has also <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481444/live-action-mortal-kombats-writer-praises-the-costumes-and-weapons">praised the film's costumes</a>, so hopefully Mehcad Brooks will get to have <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478252/mortal-kombat-updated-cast-list-heres-how-they-could-look-in-the-movie?pv=search">Jax's iconic metal arms</a>. Now just bring on <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477465/yes-the-mortal-kombat-movie-will-have-game-accurate-fatalities?pv=search">the fatalities</a>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Mortal Kombat</i> tournament begins, in theaters on March 5, 2021. That’s a long ways off, but there are plenty of huge movies coming next year.
