      <h1>Refreshed Porsche Panamera Could Have 911-Inspired Changes</h1>
      <h2>But to be honest, it doesn't look much different.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:05:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>The second-generation <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/panamera">Porsche Panamera</a> has only been on sale since 2017, but the time has already come for the luxury sedan to receive a mid-cycle facelift. Spy photos have shown the updated Panamera being put through its paces with minimal camouflage. This has allowed talented artist Nikita Chuyko at <a href="https://www.kolesa.ru/news/obnovlennyy-porsche-panamera-pervye-izobrazheniya">Kolesa </a>to produce some convincing-looking renders showing us what it will look like when the covers come off. Unsurprisingly, the subtle styling changes will be heavily inspired by the 992-generation Porsche 911.</p>

      <p>At the front, the new Panamera facelift will feature a new bumper with c-shaped LED lights for the turn signals. Elsewhere, the rear will be updated with new rear lights connected by a full-width light strip. The changes are subtle, but they should help keep the Panamera looking fresh against the competition while keeping the design language consistent with the current 911, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/cayenne">Cayenne</a>, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/macan">Macan</a>.</p>
      <p>Don't expect any significant changes inside the cabin, as <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/take-a-first-look-inside-the-2020-porsche-panamera-facelift">recent spy shots</a> showed the only notable update will be a new steering wheel from taken from the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/911-carrera">2020 Porsche 911 Carrera</a> and possibly updated infotainment software.</p>

      <p>Bigger changes will be found in the powertrain department, however. While the S and 4S models are expected to use the same 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6 as the current Panamera, both models will reportedly adopt the 48-volt mild hybrid system and electric compressor electrical architecture that was added to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/s6">2020 Audi S6</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/s7">S7</a>.</p>
      <p>A new range-topping "Lion" variant could also join the lineup packing at least 750 hp or as much as 820 hp. Porsche is allegedly building the new track-focused Panamera as a one-off special to attempt a new Nurburgring lap record, but we're hoping it will also enter production. The updated Porsche Panamera will likely debut sometime next year, but Porsche hasn't made any official announcements yet.</p>
