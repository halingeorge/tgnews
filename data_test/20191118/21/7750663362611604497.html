      <h1>Lionel Messi 'wants Barcelona to re-sign Dani Olmo'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-messi/"><b>Lionel Messi</b></a> is reportedly keen for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> to re-sign <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/dinamo-zagreb/"><b>Dinamo Zagreb</b></a> attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dani-olmo/"><b>Dani Olmo</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 21-year-old spent seven years in the Barca youth system before joining Dinamo, where he has developed into a key player for the Croatian giants.</p>
      <p>Olmo has netted six times and contributed six assists in 17 appearances at club level this season, while he scored on his senior debut for Spain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/malta/euro-2020/result/result-santi-cazorla-among-scorers-as-spain-thrash-malta_379151.html">against Malta</a> on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The attacker suggested over the weekend that he could return to Camp Nou at some point, and according to reports in Spain, Messi would support a swoop for the youngster.</p>
      <p>The Spanish champions are likely to face competition should they make a move, though, with Manchester City <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/transfer-talk/news/man-city-interested-in-signing-dani-olmo_378801.html">also believed</a> to be closely monitoring his form.</p>
      <p>Olmo has a contract at Stadion Maksimir until the end of the 2020-21 campaign.</p>
