      <p>A former synagogue in Ukraine built in the 18th century was destroyed in a fire.</p>
      <p>The Great Synagogue in Illintsi, in southwest Ukraine, has been used since the Holocaust as a furniture factory and carpentry workshop, the Jewish Heritage Europe website reported. The source of the fire was not reported.</p>
      <p>The blaze broke out Thursday evening and the building, made of brick in the baroque style, collapsed within about an hour, the news website <i>20minut.ua</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Before World War II, the majority of Illintsiâ€™s population was Jewish. Germans entered the town in July 1941 and soon after kept the Jews as prisoners in a ghetto.</p>
      <p>In April 1942, about 1,000 Jews from the town and nearby villages were killed in a mass execution, and 700 others were murdered at the end of May that year. At the end of 1942, the remaining Jews of Illintsi were deported to a labor camp and the ghetto was destroyed.</p>
