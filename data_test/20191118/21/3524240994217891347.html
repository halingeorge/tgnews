      <p>Three people were sentenced to jail Monday for “negligence” in Algeria after the death of eight newborns two months ago in a fire at a maternity ward, official news agency APS reported.</p>
      <p>Seven people were arrested at the end of September in connection to the deadly fire.</p>
      <p>On September 24, a blaze ripped through a hospital in the eastern town of Oued Souf, killing eight babies, some from burns and others from smoke inhalation.</p>
      <p>On Monday the hospital head and his deputy were sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 100,000 dinars ($835) for “negligence”, APS said.</p>
      <p>The maternity management coordinator, also charged with negligence, was given a six-month suspended sentence with a fine of 50,000 dinars.</p>
      <p>Charges of “involuntary homicide” and “misappropriation of public funds were dropped”, the agency added.</p>
      <p>The four others accused, including a Cuban nurse, were acquitted.</p>
      <p>It was the second blaze to hit the maternity hospital in Oued Souf in 16 months. A fire in May last year caused significant damage but no casualties.</p>
