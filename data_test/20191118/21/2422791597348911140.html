      <h1>Cancer drug shortage should end sooner than expected: Health Canada</h1>

      <p>TORONTO -- A <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/patients-urged-to-find-alternatives-during-cancer-drug-shortage-1.4683338">national shortage</a> of a common breast cancer drug is expected to end a month earlier than expected, Health Canada said Monday.</p>
      <p>Two manufacturers with a version of the anti-estrogen drug Tamoxifen on the market are reporting that shortages should end in December instead of Jan. 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>AstraZeneca Canada Inc. estimates that its shortage will end Dec. 6, while Apotex Inc. estimates its shortage end date will now be Dec. 31.</p>
      <p>In a statement to CTV News, Health Canada said it has been working to “identify mitigation measures, including exploring access to international supply,” adding that the new estimates are a result of that work.</p>
      <p>“When national shortages occur, Health Canada works with stakeholders across the drug supply chain to determine the details and status of the shortage, coordinate information-sharing, and identify mitigation strategies, which may include regulatory measures to accelerate resupply if possible,” the agency said.</p>
      <p>The Health Canada statement did not provide an update on a third manufacturer of the drug, Teva Canada Ltd.</p>
      <p>Tamoxifen is the most commonly used anti-estrogen drug given to cancer patients as part of hormonal therapy, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/breast/treatment/hormonal-therapy/?region=on">Canadian Cancer Society</a>. It’s also used to prevent the return of cancer, so patients can often be prescribed the drug for as long as a decade.</p>
      <p>“The health and safety of Canadians is our top priority, and we recognize the significant impact that this shortage has on patients,” the Health Canada statement said.</p>
      <p>Patients are being encouraged to visit their doctors to find alternatives during the shortage as patient needs will vary, a top oncologist told CTV’s Your Morning last week.</p>
      <p>“Every patient has an individual risk depending on the type of cancer that they’ve had,” said Dr. Leta Forbes, a medical oncologist and the provincial head of systemic treatment at Cancer Care Ontario.</p>
      <p>“We recommend that they speak to their healthcare professional about what the risks are of a temporary pause in their treatment or what alternatives there could be that they could be switched to in the interim.”</p>
