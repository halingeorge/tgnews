        <b>A number of Leeds United supporters have taken to Twitter to laud Jordan Stevens after the midfielder scored to help the Whites’ under-23s to a 2-0 victory over Barnsley on Monday.</b>

      <p>Carlos Corberan’s men were looking to bounce back after being beaten 7-1 by Derby County in their previous fixture.</p>

      <p>It did not take the Whites long to get back on track. Ryan Edmondson broke the deadlock inside four minutes after he was set up by Liam McCarron.</p>
      <p>McCarron was arguably one of the most impressive performers on show. But it was another who doubled Leeds’s lead in the second-half as Stevens produced a smart piece of play.</p>

      <p>Barnsley seemed to switch off as a header was sent towards Edmondson in an offside position. The striker left the ball alone, and that allowed Stevens to burst through the middle and guide the ball past the goalkeeper with a composed finish.</p>
      <h3>Stevens bouncing back</h3>
      <p>Stevens is one of a number of players who appear to be on the cusp of the first-team picture at Elland Road. He made his senior debut last season, and has been included in Marcelo Bielsa’s squad on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>The former Forest Green man, of course, had to serve a lengthy suspension earlier this season, but it appears that he is back on track and ready to push for another first-team chance.</p>
      <p>Plenty of Leeds fans took to social media after the win to praise the 19-year-old. They felt that he was one of the standout performers, with the intelligence that he showed for the goal also attracting plaudits.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the supporters made of Stevens’s display…</p>
