      <p>Indian police fought street battles in New Delhi on Monday with thousands of students who stepped up protests over fee increases at one of the country's top universities.</p>
      <p>Police baton charged some groups of demonstrators and media reports said dozens of students from Jawaharlal Nehru University were detained.</p>
      <p>The university is one of India's most prestigious and counts top politicians including Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and this year's Nobel economics prize winner Abhijit Banerjee among past students.</p>
      <p>Defying a ban on groups of more than four people, demonstrators started a march from the university to the parliament as part of their action against higher costs for accommodation as well as curfews and other restrictions on campus.</p>
      <p>They broke through police barricades and police had to close three metro stations because of the troubles, which first erupted last week when police fired water cannon on the students.</p>
      <p>While the government said it had created a three-member panel to hold talks with the students, the demonstrators have said they will not stop their action until the fee hike is rescinded.</p>
      <p>"We will not end the protest till the police release the students who have been detained," added one protester, who only gave his name as Jitendra.</p>
      <p>Teachers at the university have voiced concern over the way the government and police were handling what they called "peaceful" protests.</p>
