      <p>Less than one month ago (October 25), Kanye West released his ninth solo album, <i>JESUS IS KING</i>. The Spiritual 11-song collection involved a Clipse reunion, appearances from Ty Dolla $ign, and Jazz artist Kenny G, as well as guest production from Timbaland. The G.O.O.D Music/Def Jam Records LP subsequently topped the charts upon release.</p>
      <p>West now vows that a <i>JESUS IS KING, PT. II</i> is on the way and “coming soon.” This one, he suggests on social media, will be a collaboration with Dr. Dre.</p>

      <p>West and Dre have worked on several of the same albums, including <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2015/12/the-games-the-documentary-vs-scarfaces-the-fix-which-is-better/">The Game’s <i>The Documentary</i></a> and JAY-Z’s <i>Kingdom Come</i>. However, they have never released songs together. Previously, West released an album with Jay in 2011.</p>
      <p>Other artists, including <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/02/busta-rhymes-album-dr-dre/">Busta Rhymes</a> and <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/08/krs-one-dr-dre/">KRS-One</a>, have posted similar photos with the Aftermath Entertainment founder in the studio, suggesting music is on the way.
