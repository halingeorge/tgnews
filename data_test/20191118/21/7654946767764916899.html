      <p>A case of the bubonic plague was reported in China over the weekend — after two people there were diagnosed with the pneumonic plague last week.</p>
      <p>Both diseases are associated with the Black Death pandemic that killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe alone in the 14th Century.</p>
      <p>The new patient from Xilingol in Inner Mongolia hunted and ate a wild rabbit on Nov. 5, <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/17/c_138562299.htm">according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency</a>.</p>
      <p>The person, who was not identified, was hospitalized in the county of Huade in north China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the news agency said, citing the regional health commission.</p>
      <p>A total of 28 people who were in close contact with the patient were put under medical quarantine. No one has shown symptoms such as fever, so far, the commission said.</p>
      <p>The incident comes after two other patients from the northwestern Inner Mongolia province were quarantined at a hospital in Beijing after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/two-patients-diagnosed-with-plague-in-china-as-officials-scramble-to-prevent-outbreak/">suffering from the pneumonic plague</a>.</p>
      <p>Authorities say that the cases appear to be unrelated.</p>
