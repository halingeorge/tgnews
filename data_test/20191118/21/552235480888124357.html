      <h1>Who Scotland could face in Euro 2020 playoffs – the latest permutations</h1>
      <h2>The play-off pathway to Euro 2020 is complicated to say the least.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:39:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:39</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland have won the right to be at home in the play-off semi-final for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> at Hampden on March 26.</p>
      <p>They finished the highest ranked <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nations-league">Nations League</a> C group winner after seeing off Israel and Albania in the group stage of the new look competition last year.</p>
      <p>They will be pitted in the spring against one of the three best losers from the current European Championship qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>A draw will be made this Friday, November 22, by UEFA and the Scots will face either Bulgaria, Israel or Romania.</p>
      <p>In the other semi-final, Norway will host Serbia, with the two winners meeting in a final shootout on March 31.</p>
      <p>The host for the play-off final will also be drawn by UEFA on Friday, with semi-final winner one or two hosting the nerve-shredding fixture to determine a place at Euro 2020 next summer.</p>
      <p>Scotland are in Path C and there are also places available at Euro 2020 for the winners from Path A, B and D.</p>
      <p>Path D includes Georgia, Northern Macedonia, Kosovo and Belarus, which ensures at least one minnow nation will be involved at the big event.</p>
      <p>The draws for Paths A and B remain up in the air with nations such as Wales and Slovakia set to become involved if they don’t qualify for Euro 2020 automatically.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/republic-of-ireland-football-team">Republic or Ireland</a> will also be involved in that path after tonight's 1-1 draw with Denmark put the Danes into the tournament.</p>
      <p>The complex system is such that Bulgaria, Israel or Romania, if they aren’t pitched with Scotland, could join Iceland in Path A, possibly with Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/michael-oneill">Michael O’Neill</a> ’s side could also find themselves in Path B alongside Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Welsh, Slovaks or the Republic.</p>
