      <p>Homesick Caitlyn Jenner told <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> viewers her "head was spinning" after a restless night in the Aussie jungle.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, 70, was bedding down with Team Snake Rock for the group's first night under the stars - but was spotted wiping away a tear in the early hours as she failed to settle.</p>
      <p>But it turns out she had much more on her mind than forthcoming meals of rice and beans.</p>
      <p>Referencing her age, Caitlyn confessed in the Bush Telegraph she was concerned whether taking part in the ITV reality show was the "best use of her time."</p>

      <p>She also wondered whether she should be devoting more time to her family while she can.</p>
      <p>However, the sobbing star defiantly resolved to stick with it.</p>
      <aside>I didn’t want to be an old chick.</aside>
      <p>"I've never quit anything I've ever done," she said.</p>
      <p>Comedian Andrew Maxwell - who noticed Caitlyn seemed less bubbly in the morning - reflected sympathetically in the Bush Telegraph: "You never know when doubts and anxiety and fear will strike."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Within a few hours, Caitlyn returned to discussing her family and her age as she opened up about issues around her transition.</p>
      <p>Describing her identity as a "dirty secret in the family", she also noted she intended to transition much earlier in life.</p>
      <p>"I thought I was gouging to transition before 40," she told the group.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t want to be an old chick."</p>

      <p>Caitlyn also revealed how she was compelled to fib to a neighbour when she was spotted in her Porsche dressed in women's clothes before it was known she hoped to transition.</p>
      <p>"I told [the neighbour] I was on the way to a Halloween party," Caitlyn recalled before the group bonded over a raucous sing song of Dude (Looks Like A Lady) by Aerosmith.</p>
      <p>Host Declan Donnelly expressed surprise at Caitlyn's words as he linked to the next segment.</p>
      <p>"I thought we were going to have to wait until the end of week one at least for such golden chat!" he joked.</p>
