      <h1>Milk abhisheka for BJP rebel candidate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:43:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/dhns" target="_blank">DHNS</a></address>
      <p>Supporters of BJP rebel Kaviraj Urs, who filed his nomination papers as Independent for Assembly bypoll from Vijayanagar constituency on Monday, performed milk abhisheka on their leader.</p>
      <p>Urs, who has been sulking over the party giving the ticket to disqualified Congress MLA Anand Singh, on Monday - the last day of filing of nominations - submitted his nomination papers to the election officer.</p>
      <p>Supporters greeted their leader with garlands and poured 101 litres of milk on him.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Urs said, "The BJP has done injustice to me and many loyalists. It is not fair to field a turncoat when many loyal workers were aspiring for the ticket. The party workers wanted me to contest. Hence, I have filed my nomination. I will not withdraw my papers at any cost."</p>
      <p>A host of leaders, including Health Minister B Sriramulu, BJP state general secretary Ravi Kumar tried to placate the sulking leader. But Urs held his ground firm and contesting bypolls as an independent.</p>
