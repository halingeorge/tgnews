      <p>Several environment leaders say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau needs to put action on climate change in the mandate letter of every minister he names to his inner circle.</p>
      <p>Trudeau is set to unveil his first post-election cabinet Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Isabelle Turcotte from the Pembina Institute says climate action is not only for the environment minister to manage and the way Trudeau sets up his next cabinet should reflect that.</p>
      <p>She says if the government agrees it is a crisis, then it must make all its decisions through the lens of the impact it might have on emissions and climate change.</p>
      <p>Catherine Abreu, executive director of the Climate Action Network Canada, says Trudeau also needs to highlight the transition to a clean economy.</p>
      <p>Abreu says she would love to see a separate ministry dedicated to helping Canada transition to a new economy, including for dealing with the impact of other changes such as technology and the gig economy.</p>
