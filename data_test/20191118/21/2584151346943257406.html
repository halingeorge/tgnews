      <h1>Iran’s leadership faces its biggest test of survival</h1>
      <h2>Tehran is having to slash the fuel subsidies that are crucial to its power base.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:59:06+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:59</time> by <a rel="author">Christian Oliver</a></address>
      <p>The Islamic Republic of Iran is facing the greatest threat to its survival since the war with Iraq in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>The Revolutionary Guards, who answer directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Monday issued an <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/iran-revolutionary-guards-decisive-action-suppress-deadly-fuel-protests-1472400">ominous threat of “decisive” action</a> against the (at least) tens of thousands of Iranians who have taken to the streets nationwide to protest an increase in the price of gasoline.</p>
      <p>In a country where virtually free petrol is seen as almost a birthright, the effect of the price hike has been explosive. Over the past four days, <a href="https://en.irna.ir/news/83560119/Gov-t-spox-says-people-stayed-away-from-rioters">state media</a> say protesters have torched cars, banks, petrol stations and police stations in a wave of unrest that has caught the leadership off balance. Several people have died, and hundreds have been arrested.</p>
      <p>Iran has faced down protests before, but the regime is now in far deeper trouble because the latest demonstrations center on the biggest bread-and-butter issue of them all: subsidies.</p>
      <p>As the holder of the world’s third-biggest oil reserves, Tehran has traditionally been able to buy political favor, or at least quiescence, by pouring spectacular sums into subsidies for energy, food and water. The International Energy Agency classes Iran as easily the biggest provider of fossil-fuel subsidies in the world: splashing out <a href="https://www.iea.org/weo/energysubsidies/">$69 billion</a> in 2018.</p>
      <aside>The danger signal for the Iranian leadership is that the latest wave of discontent already seems to traverse an unusually broad raft of social, regional and ethnic groups</aside>
      <p>The fact that Iran's government now has to slash the largesse that consolidates its power base among poorer citizens is a stark sign that the economy is close to cracking point, as U.S.-led sanctions bite hard into oil exports.</p>
      <p>In a speech in the southeastern city of Kerman last week, President Hassan Rouhani admitted that the country was facing its “most difficult” days since the 1979 revolution as it struggled to sell oil on international markets and keep its tanker fleet running.</p>
      <p>Without bumper oil income, gasoline subsidies are now unsustainable. On Friday, Iran lifted prices by 50 percent and said that motorists would only be able to buy 60 liters of gasoline a month at a price of about 13 cents. Each additional liter would cost 26 cents.</p>
      <p>While that is still peanuts compared to a European price of about $1.50 per liter, it’s a hefty increase from the 250 liters a month that Iranians could buy at about 8 cents per liter. The news triggered instant outrage among Iranian motorists, who have long felt entitled to slosh petrol around as if it were tap water.</p>
      <p>The danger signal for the Iranian leadership is that the latest wave of discontent already seems to traverse an unusually broad raft of social, regional and ethnic groups, from poor workers who commute across cities in shared <i>“savari”</i> taxis to Kurds in the country’s west.</p>

      <p>In private, ordinary Iranians often complain about the state’s massive economic mismanagement and corruption, but have traditionally tended to bite their lips while food and fuel remain cheap. Now, the rules of the game have changed.</p>
      <p>And the Revolutionary Guards are moving in.</p>
      <h3>Don't make the poor poorer</h3>
      <p>As always with protests in Iran, it is hard to gauge what is going on thanks to the state’s immediate restrictions on the internet, but the scale of the unrest looks worrying for the government.</p>
      <p>In a sign of the grassroots nature of the protests, the U.S.-government-backed Radio Farda reported protesters in the southern city of Ahvaz saying that expensive gasoline would only make the <a href="https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-faces-fresh-protests-after-petrol-price-hike-/30275079.html">“poor poorer.”</a> Many outlets carried pictures of blocked roads, burned out cars, and chanting crowds. Radio Farda cited people in Iran saying dozens of protesters had died, and reported that some demonstrators had attacked offices of imams as well as banks linked to the Revolutionary Guards. Radio Farda’s website also carried a photograph of <a href="https://www.radiofarda.com/a/protesters-demands-on-recent-protests/30276636.html">a poster of the supreme leader in flames</a> — an ultimate taboo in Iran.</p>
      <p>Sticking to the usual playbook, Khamenei cast the unrest as “sabotage” by enemies and described the protesters as “hooligans.” Iran normally identifies the United States, Israel and Britain as the puppet-masters behind sedition.</p>
      <p>The state’s IRNA news agency reported that the Revolutionary Guards had rounded up <a href="https://en.irna.ir/news/83560237/150-ringleaders-of-sabotage-teams-arrested-by-IRGC-in-Alborz">150 "ringleaders"</a> in a province west of Tehran, some of whom “confessed to being hired by trained people inside and outside the country.”</p>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a message of support to the Iranian protesters, saying that: <a href="https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1195800549322625025?s=20">"The United States is with you."</a> That won the usual frosty reception in Tehran. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi replied: "Such hypocrite statements are completely devoid of sincere sympathy."</p>
      <h3>Years of incompetence</h3>
      <p>Even if the authorities snuff out the immediate protests with a crackdown, their longer term survival will depend on their ability to find more money for dole-outs. And quickly. Parliamentary elections are due in February.</p>
      <p>The official line from the government is that it is diverting gasoline subsidies from well-off drivers to be able to give cash to millions of poor families. But the fragility of the Iranian economy — already suffering from high unemployment and surging inflation — means that will be an almost impossible feat to pull off. Iran is highly dependent on road transport and higher gasoline prices would likely feed almost instantaneously into higher consumer prices more broadly.</p>
      <p>This is a conflict that the Iranian leadership always feared. For years, Tehran has pledged to combat the negative effects of subsidies but never made real headway through fear of the fall-out.</p>
      <aside>As the years of economic incompetence now come back to haunt them, Iran's leaders are tripping over themselves not to appear responsible for the damage.</aside>
      <p>In the meantime, the subsidies have proved to be a curse. Ultra-cheap gasoline meant that Iran was squandering massive potential export earnings, as well as filling its cities with headache-inducing smog. The cheap gasoline also turbo-charged the smuggling trade, and fuelled epidemic levels of corruption, as Iranians found ways to ship the bargain-basement petrol abroad to sell it at a much higher price.</p>
      <p>Water subsidies were another disaster. A botched push for agricultural self-sufficiency — in crops such as wheat — using subsidized water in unsuitable terrains means that the country is destroying key water courses and that large swathes of Iranian land are at risk of drying out permanently.</p>
      <p>As the years of economic incompetence now come back to haunt them, Iran's leaders are tripping over themselves not to appear responsible for the damage.</p>
      <p>Rouhani said he had successfully argued against an even higher, recommended rise in the price in gasoline. Khamenei passed the buck on the measure, saying that he was not "an expert" in such things.</p>
      <p>That doesn't mean they won't have to face the consequences.</p>
