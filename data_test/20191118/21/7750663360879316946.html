      <p>The 28-year-old has not actually turned out for Madrid since October 22 due to a muscular problem, but the Colombia international was allowed to join up with his country for the latest set of fixtures.</p>
      <p>James came down with an injury during a training session last week, though, and Los Blancos have confirmed that the South American has damaged a ligament in his left knee.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>'s side have not placed a timeframe on the attacker's recovery, but various reports in Spain have indicated that he is likely to miss the remainder of 2019.</p>
      <p>"After undergoing tests by Real Madrid's medical staff today, our player James Rodriguez has been diagnosed with a strained internal ligament in his left knee," read a statement from the Spanish giants.</p>
      <p>James, who returned to the Bernabeu over the summer following two seasons on loan at Bayern Munich, has scored once in nine appearances during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Madrid will return to La Liga action with a home game against Real Sociedad on Saturday night.</p>
