      <p>The person who was struck and killed by a truck last Friday near Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops has been identified as 54-year-old Lucy Phua.</p>
      <p>Thompson Rivers University spokesperson Darshan Lindsay says in an emailed statement the pedestrian killed near the university last week was a TRU employee. Phua's LinkedIn and Facebook accounts say she was an academic advisor at TRU.</p>
      <p>"Our focus at this time is on supporting family members and our employees, and we will not be providing further information," Lindsay says.</p>
      <p>Kamloops RCMP responded to the accident on<a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/pedestrian-killed-in-kamloops-crash/it67684"> Friday, Nov. 15, at around 5:30 p.m. near the intersection of McGill Road</a> and University Drive. Phua was pronounced dead at the scene after being struck by a truck.</p>
      <p>"The collision between a truck and a pedestrian necessitated the closure of the roadways into the area for over six hours to allow police to investigate the accident," police said. The driver of the truck remained at the scene of the crash.</p>
      <p>Kamloops RCMP media spokesperson Cpl. Jodi Shelkie says the woman was walking through a crosswalk at a green light while the driver, a man in his 40s, was turning left.</p>
      <p>"It was dark at that time and raining and we are not sure if that plays (a factor) at all. This time we would like to remind people that it is getting darker earlier so pedestrians please wear light colours or reflective material and drivers please at intersections look for pedestrians in crosswalks and at corners of crosswalks," Shelkie says.</p>
      <p>The investigation into the crash continues and no charges have been laid.</p>
