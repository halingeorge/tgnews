      <p>Chick-fil-A is ending its donations to two charities widely regarded to be anti-LGBTQ after years of protests over their ties. While it didn't acknowledge the groups' allegedly anti-LGBTQ records, the fast food chain <a href="https://www.chick-fil-afoundation.org/news-events/the-chick-fil-a-foundation-shares-details-of-2018-charitable-donations">said Monday</a> it will stop donations to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes as it reworks its charitable giving arm.</p>
      <p>The Salvation Army and FCA were major recipients of Chick-fil-A Foundation donations in 2018, with $115,000 going toward the Salvation Army for holiday gifts and $1.65 million heading to the FCA for summer sports camps at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. But next year, the foundation says it will shift its donations to "key organizations that address education, homelessness and hunger," and those charities <a href="https://www.chick-fil-afoundation.org/our-focus">aren't on the list</a>.</p>
      <p>The move comes after years of boycotts and protests over Chick-fil-A's ties to these and other Christian organizations that seem to espouse homophobia and other anti-LGBTQ goals. The FCA explicitly affirms anti-LGBTQ views on its website and employment applications, but the Salvation Army has denied <a href="https://www.advocate.com/religion/2017/12/08/salvation-army-we-meet-human-need-without-discrimination">claims that it is discriminatory</a>. Chick-fil-A didn't mention anything about LGBTQ rights concerns in its Monday statement, but one thing is for sure: Mike Huckabee won't be getting in line. Kathryn Krawczyk</p>
