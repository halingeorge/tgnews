      <p>An elderly man has died after he crashed into a Stobie pole at Valley View. Police are investigating if it was a medical episode.</p>
      <p>The Ford sedan left the road and hit a Stobie pole at the intersection of Nelson and Grand Junction roads about 4.10pm on November 6.</p>
      <p>The 97-year-old driver, of Enfield, was taken to hospital but died on Monday.</p>
      <p>His 90-year-old female passenger was taken to hospital with minor injuries.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating whether the driver suffered a medical episode before the crash and appealing for dashcam footage.</p>
      <p>The man’s death is the 98th on SA roads, compared to 65 at the same time last year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile an alleged drink driver crashed his car into a fence at Magill.</p>

      <p>The 83-year-old Rosslyn Park man was initially unresponsive after he crashed near the intersection of the Parade and Penfold Rd about 1.20am on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The drowsy driver allegedly blew 0.174 – more than three times over the legal limit, police said.</p>
      <p>He was taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital and is expected to be reported for drink driving and driving without due care. He will be summonsed to appear in court at a later date.</p>
      <p>He lost his licence for 12 months and his car was towed away.</p>
