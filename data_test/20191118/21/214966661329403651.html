      <h1>Lack of punishment for Qld juvenile arsonists an ‘injustice to the community’ </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:25:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/mstclair/" target="_blank">Monique StClair</a></address>
      <p>The state opposition leader is calling for juvenile arsonists to be properly punished, amid alarming new statistics.</p>
      <p>It’s been revealed that 136 Queensland kids have been charged with lighting fires in the last two years alone.</p>
      <p>According to Newscorp, 48 youths were charged with endangering property with deliberate blazes last year, and 88 were charged the year before.</p>
      <p>However, only 18 of those were convicted.</p>
      <p>Opposition Leader Deb Frecklington says it’s simply not good enough.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s an injustice to the community,” Ms Frecklington told <i>myGC</i>.</p>
      <p>“The community expects punishments for these – they could be called malicious little fire bugs – to reflect the enormous damage that the’re doing and the action that they’ve caused.</p>
      <p>“When you’ve got so many areas of the state being burnt out, stock without feed, homes that have been lost, buildings that have been lost… that’s just not good enough and it sends a terrible message to the community,” Ms Frecklington said.</p>
      <p>She’s calling for kids to face real consequences for their actions, like being made to apologise to their victims and even attend a burns unit.</p>
