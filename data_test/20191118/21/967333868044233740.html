      <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on five entities, four individuals in Turkey, Afghanistan and Syria over links to the Daesh* terrorist group, the US Treasury Department said in a press release on Monday.</p>
      <blockquote>"Today, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated two Turkey-based Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) procurement agents and four ISIS-linked companies operating in Syria, Turkey, and across the Gulf and Europe for providing critical financial and logistical support to ISIS," the release said.</blockquote>
      <p>The Treasury Department also said it is acting against the Afghanistan-based Nejaat Social Welfare Organization for using false charitable pretences as a cover to facilitate the transfer of funds and support the activities of Daesh* – Khorasan in Afghanistan.</p>
      <blockquote>"Treasury also took action against two senior officials affiliated with this organization," the release said.</blockquote>
      <p>In September, the US also targeted Daesh* with sanctions, as well as other groups including al-Qaeda, Iran's IRGC and Hamas. Then the targets included 15 leaders, individuals and entities affiliated with those groups. </p>
      <p>On 27 October, US President Donald Trump announced that Daesh* leader <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911161077325334-turkey-detains-25-relatives-of-dead-daesh-leader-al-baghdadi-reports/">al-Baghdadi died</a> during a US raid on his hideout in Syria by blowing himself up after being chased into a dead-end tunnel. </p>
