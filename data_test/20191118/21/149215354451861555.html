        <b>Taylor Swift can play her old songs at the American Music Awards after all</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our long national nightmare is over. After a whole weekend of bad blood, Taylor Swift's old label Big Machine has finally relented in an increasingly high-profile feud. Swift will now be permitted to record and distribute her upcoming performance at the American Music Awards on November 24, which will reportedly include numerous old songs owned by Big Machine. With an agreement in place, Swift will be able to perform older songs like "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," which will be particularly handy if Big Machine still hasn't gotten the message yet.

        <b>The Justice League reunites to demand the release of the 'Snyder cut'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since the release of the critically maligned, financially disappointing <i>Justice League</i> in 2017, fans have begged for the release of the "Snyder cut": A long-rumored, possibly nonexistent version of the movie that matched director Zack Snyder's original vision, which will somehow fix all the flaws of the disaster that originally arrived in theaters. But with no release announced by Warner Bros., hope seemed lost, so several <i>Justice League</i> heroes — including Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) and Ben Affleck (Batman) — took to Twitter to demand the release of the Snyder cut. The high-profile support has newly raised fans' hopes that the release might actually be on the horizon, because frankly, pretty much <i>any</i> recut of the original would qualify as an improvement.

        <b>Kourtney Kardashian shames Kim and Khloé for eating candy</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you go trick-or-treating next year, feel free to skip Kourtney Kardashian's place. Kourtney recently shamed sisters Kim and Khloé for chowing down on candy, calling it "the biggest number one cause of aging," because apparently she's never heard of the passage of time. Kourtney added that she believes eating candy "sucks the life and youthfulness out of your skin," so it's possible she just confused "eating a Snickers bar" with "being attacked by a vampire."

        <b>Werner Herzog says Baby Yoda made him cry</b>
      </p>
      <p>You may have sensed a disturbance in The Force last week — as if millions of <i>Star Wars</i> fans who watched <i>The Mandalorian</i> suddenly cried out, "sooooooo cuuuuuuute!" The first episode of the new TV show ended by introducing an adorable baby who seems to be the same species as beloved fan-favorite Yoda — and if you were moved to tears by Baby Yoda, you have something in common with German filmmaking auteur and <i>Mandalorian</i> star Werner Herzog, who said the sweet and vulnerable Baby Yoda "made you cry when you saw it." As another famous puppet once said: It's not easy bein' green. [<a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/baby-yoda-the-mandalorian-werner-herzog-1203406285/"><i>Variety</i></a>]</p>

        <b>Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson like to cook soup together</b>
      </p>
      <p>What does a beloved A-list actor do when he's not starring in Oscar-nominated movies or adding to his typewriter collection? According to Tom Hanks, he and wife Rita Wilson mostly like to cook soup together, adding that the process can take two to three hours — so they're probably doing more than heating up some Campbell's in the microwave. That might sound like a fairly low-key hobby for a celebrity, but as Forrest Gump famously said: Life is like a bowl of chowder.
