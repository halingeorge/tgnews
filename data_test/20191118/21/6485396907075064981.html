      <p>With only six weeks left in the season, the playoff picture is coming into focus. So let’s talk about the wild-card race. We’ll start in the NFC: The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401128133">Sunday Night Football matchup</a> featured two teams that needed a win to bolster their playoff chances — and yet neither seemed to want the W.</p>

      <p>There were no winners here.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>LOL</p>
      <p>The Bears are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo">all but done</a> now. Do the Rams still have a chance?</p>
      <p><b>Salfino</b> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/michael-salfino/">Michael Salfino</a>, FiveThirtyEight contributor): During the game, I was wondering how many plays it would take the Bears to score a TD if we all agreed that they would not leave the field until they did. I said 33, but that’s probably light.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer</b> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/josh-hermsmeyer/">Josh Hermsmeyer</a>, NFL analyst): I’m still sort of in shock that Mitch Trubisky had a higher QBR than Jared Goff. If that continues, I don’t see how the Rams are in playoff contention.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>He also had more fantasy points in our league than Goff did. (Says the idiot who owns them both.)</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>That’s only because you traded Kirk Cousins, Sara.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>(And I didn’t even start Cousins this week.)</p>
      <p>Even after that win, it’s looking tough for L.A. Here’s a list of the QBs <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/lar">the Rams will face</a> from here on:</p>
      <p>Lamar Jackson</p>
      <p>Kyler Murray</p>
      <p>Russell Wilson</p>
      <p>Dak Prescott</p>
      <p>Jimmy Garoppolo</p>
      <p>Kyler Murray</p>
      <p>All of those guys are on hot streaks right now.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>It feels like those are all the good QBs in the league, Neil. The carnage at the position this year is insane. Can’t remember anything like it — not just the guys who are injured but guys like Goff and Trubisky and even Carson Wentz taking big steps back.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>To be fair, <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/10/chicago-bears-mitchell-trubisky-nickname-leonard-floyd-pretty-boy-assassin-mr-biscuit">Biscuit</a> and Goff taking steps back isn’t entirely surprising. There were real questions about both coming into the season. Wentz is more of a mystery.</p>
      <p>Another mystery: Did Wentz get a full sleeve tattoo?</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Hahaha</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>OMG, I thought the same exact thing!</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Can you do that in one week though?</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Well, two weeks. They had a Week 10 bye.</p>
      <p>

      <p><b>Salfino: </b>The Eagles and Patriots were so tough to watch just a couple of years off their <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201802040nwe.htm">electric Super Bowl</a>. Neither team has any explosion. They’re like bantamweights with no knockout punch, just jabbing away and trying to score points with the judges. Incapable of throwing a haymaker unless, for New England, it’s a trick play.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And you can say the same thing about the Bears and Rams, too.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>Trubisky also had a higher QBR than Tom Brady. And Trubisky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0z7BdtsmBM">may have been benched</a>.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Oof</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Brady is looking every bit of 42 years old this year: <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm">6.8 yards per attempt. 3.5 percent touchdown rate</a>.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>It remains very odd to see the Pats be a defense-first team with a middling offense.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>You could see in the <a href="https://www.patriots.com/video/tom-brady-11-17-we-can-do-everything-better">postgame presser</a> how defeated Brady was. He knows the circus is leaving town.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>If we do get a Pats-Ravens playoff matchup, the Pats will be the defensive juggernaut and the Ravens will be the offensive machine. Talk about a role reversal from the past decade or so.</p>
      <p>(But that’s looking way too far ahead down the road, I know.)</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>This is like the 2003 Patriots. Their defense seems to know the plays the offense is running better than the offense.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>If it wins them a Super Bowl, <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2003.htm">like it did then</a>, I doubt Brady will mind.</p>
      <p>But what about the Eagles? What’s their prognosis for the playoffs?</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>They’re still in it, at least <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo">according to our odds</a>. We give them a 47 percent chance to make the playoffs.</p>
      <p>But almost all of that is tied up in winning the division. They’ll get one more crack at Dallas, and we still think they’re favored in each remaining game.</p>

      <p><b>Salfino: </b>I can’t believe how we just can’t quit the Eagles — how they stay around somehow. It’s just that division is still in play. The two wild-card teams seem set, so it’s weird that they’re trying to get in through the front door.</p>
      <p>Plus, Dallas has to go to New England in Week 12.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>The wild cards are usually harder to win than the weakest division, though, right? Elo thinks the East is weakest, in terms of the conference’s top teams.</p>
      <p>The NFC East usually feels like this, I think. Last year, it <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/index.htm">only took 10 wins</a> to take the title. (Or maybe I am just also thinking back to the year <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/index.htm">Washington won it at 9-7</a>.)</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>I actually think the Cowboys are much better than the Eagles. There is no weakness that I can identify with them, yet <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401128052">they almost lost to Jeff Driskel</a>, who looked like Doug Flutie out there. Maybe it was the jersey number.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>The Eagles secondary was held up as <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/eagles/coaching-eagles-secondary-loss-cowboys-carson-wentz-doug-pederson-jalen-mills">a huge problem</a> for a large part of the year, but it seems they might have found a plan that works. They have played mostly man coverage the past three games, holding opponents to just 3.4 passing yards per attempt out of those looks.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>That’s shocking because I thought the Eagles secondary was hopeless. Unfortunately, their offense hasn’t averaged much more per pass in this period, either.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>They’re just a deeply average team. After adjusting for strength of schedule, their worst area in expected points added vs. average per game is special teams at -0.4, and their best is penalties at +1.6. Everything else is in between.</p>

      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>So aside from Philadelphia’s chance to win the East, the other wild-card hopefuls need either Seattle or Minnesota to falter … and though the Vikings really seemed to want to lose on Sunday, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401128081">they pulled it out</a>.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Gosh, did they ever wanna lose. They had Mike tweeting about it and everything!</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/MichaelSalfino/status/1196135030059352067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>That tweet was something else.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Sara has to be totally on board now after that show of guts and resiliency, when they became the <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-sports/vikings-stun-broncos-in-thrilling-comeback-27-23">first team in 100 games</a> to come back from a 20-plus-point halftime deficit.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>As bad a first half as Cousins had, his <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201911170min.htm#home_drives::none">second half</a> was just lights-out amazing.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>I did feel really bad for mocking Sara’s sense of jinxing only to see it bloom so fantastically and unexpectedly in the first half against a Broncos team that most weeks <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/2019/gamelog/">can’t score 20 points in an entire game</a>.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>You should always feel bad for mocking me!!!</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Cousins went from Captain Checkdown in the first half to gunslinger. It’s like he said, “Screw it.”</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>But WHY can he not just always play like that?</p>
      <p>And why does this team always seem to play to the level of competition it’s facing?</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>It’s mysterious.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>It kills me.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>He’s kinda always playing like that now! Cousins has had seven straight above-average starts, according to QB Elo.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>My sense of narrative is that he went into the game thinking, “Just don’t lose this with stupid plays.” And then he found himself in a position where he had to win it.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>I think that’s as good an explanation as any, Mike.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Cousins can find tight windows with the best of them when he just lets it rip. And he’s generally been doing that.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Well, despite that first half, they seem to be in good shape now, with a 91 percent chance of making the playoffs, according to our model.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Have you finally accepted that they are a contender?</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Of course, the moment I believe in them, they will completely fall apart.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Oh LOL.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>No</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>Amazing</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Well, sort of.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Careful, Sara.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Contender for the playoffs? Sure.</p>
      <p>Contender to win it all? LOL, of course not.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Seven percent, Sara!</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Stop it.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>There’s a chance!</p>
      <p>That’s only 2 percentage points behind the 49ers.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>👀</p>
      <p>
        <b>neil: 🤯</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>What is Minnesota’s chance to win the division, Neil, as I predict it will?</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>37 percent.</p>
      <p>Packers still favored there. Which makes the fact that Green Bay and Minnesota have the same Super Bowl odds even more impressive.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>The Vikings won’t win the division. Don’t forget that they’ll lose inexplicably to the Bears to end the regular season, <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201812300min.htm">as they do</a>.</p>
      <p>The other NFC team that was in playoff contention going into the weekend was the Carolina Panthers. And now … <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401128049">they’re not</a>.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Oooof</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>So much for Cam Newton not being needed in Carolina.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Kyle Allen is bad, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-mid-tier-nfl-teams-are-still-in-the-playoff-hunt/">we’ve been saying that for a while</a>.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>I’ve seldom seen a QB turn into a pumpkin quite as quickly as Kyle Allen.</p>
      <p>I recall that early in the season (first four games), there were comparisons to Cam that looked good for him.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Maybe to the Cam who’s been hurt since about last October.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Sad thing is, the Panthers have the seventh-best QB-neutral Elo (Elo if the starter is replaced with an average one), and their defense is fifth-best at holding opposing QBs below expectations.</p>
      <p>The supporting cast can only do so much, though.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>At least we won’t have to hear “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-christian-mccaffrey-is-the-nfls-mvp-why-arent-the-panthers-better/">a running back should be MVP</a>” talk.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Haha</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>I really want to see what Will Grier can do. He was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nfl-is-drafting-quarterbacks-all-wrong/">an analytics darling coming into the draft</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, it’s not great that he couldn’t beat out Kyle Allen, so.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>LOL</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>My God, Allen had a 4.5 QBR.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>The <a href="https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/tabeek-this-is-the-defense-we-expected-to-see-all-along">Falcons defense has been a revelation</a> since Dan Quinn <a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/mike-check/whoever-calling-plays-falcons-defense-making-them/Obh5VQXvDbIv8KS5Z49bFI/#">let go of some of the play-calling</a>, and it raises questions about the power of coaching, generally. Fine, Sunday’s game was against Kyle Allen — but they <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201911100nor.htm">crushed Drew Brees</a>, too.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>The Falcons have had one of the all-time head-scratching seasons. Their Elo rating (1499) is now basically that of an average team.</p>
      <p>And Matt Ryan is the fifth-best QB in the league.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>The Vikings’ <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201909080min.htm">season-opening win</a> over Atlanta looks better and better! 🤣</p>
      <p>Let’s move on to the AFC, where there’s a lot less clarity. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings/_/view/playoff">Five teams are within two wins</a> for the wild-card spots.</p>
      <p>Who do we like to make the playoffs there?</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Well, look at where Neil’s EPA table has the Raiders.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>And yet, Elo gives them a 41 percent chance to make the playoffs! It also gives Pittsburgh and Cleveland above 20 percent apiece.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>And Oakland is the team that everyone is sort of excited about now, even giving them a chance to win the division. (I can’t remotely see that, but the records are what they are.)</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Jon Gruden even gave Da Raidah fans <a href="https://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=28105004">the Gruden seal of approval</a>. (“They’re nuts. They’re the closest thing to me that I’ve ever seen.”)</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>I noticed that the Raiders are No. 2 in pass success rate. This shocks me: Oakland is that good in a stat so important, but so bad everywhere else that Elo hates them, basically.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Fascinating that Oakland’s Elo is only 1484 — worse than Atlanta!</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Derek Carr is secretly not bad.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Now they go into East Rutherford for another 1 p.m. local time game against a Jets defense that’s somehow third in defensive play success, including 10th against the pass.</p>
      <p>This is obviously a must-win for the Raiders, but I don’t think they get it.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>You’re taking the Jets??</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Elo is on board too: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/games/">51 percent for the Jets</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Yes. I just don’t believe in the Raiders defense at all.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>But you <i>do</i> believe in Sam Darnold, obviously.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>I need to see a lot more out of Darnold, who keeps making frustrating mistakes. Maybe he was sick longer than we thought and still is feeling a little out of it. But as a Jets fan, when he extends plays, I don’t want to hold my breath that he’s going to make a mistake. The great QBs in those spots only throw the ball in the field of play when a guy is open. Otherwise, they’ll loft it out of bounds, since that’s legal.</p>
      <p>So Sunday will be a nice test for him.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Who else in the AFC do we like?</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>The Bills continue to look … *<i>squints eyes</i>* … goooood??</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401128077">Great game by Josh Allen</a> this week.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>Josh Allen beat up on a bad defense. You like to see that.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>I can’t take the Titans seriously at all. The Steelers crashed back to earth and Mason Rudolph is bad and they are punished by him not being suspended. I can believe in the Bills, honestly. They are feisty.</p>
      <p>The Bills are the poor man’s Ravens.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>I think that’s actually a really good comp, Mike.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>That … actually kind of makes sense.</p>
      <p>LOL, yeah.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Not the worst place to be!</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>And hey, shoutout to Jacoby Brissett for <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2019/11/17/colts-vs-jaguars-jacoby-brissett-just-showed-why-he-means-so-much-colts/2556760001/">stabilizing the Colts’ season with a win</a>. We now have Indy at 54 percent playoff odds.</p>
      <p>I was wrong when I speculated that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-qbs-as-good-as-andrew-luck-have-left-the-game-so-early/">they were toast without Andrew Luck</a>. Go, Jacoby.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>We have to say something about the absurd unsuccessful challenge for defensive pass interference in the Ravens-Texans game. That was an absolutely conclusive mugging in the end zone on fourth down that would have probably resulted in a 7-0 Texans lead. Replay, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/qb-injuries-and-absurd-replay-reviews-dominated-the-nfls-week-2/">I keep saying</a>, is a false promise of justice and should be ended.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Yeah, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/texans/2019/11/17/nfl-pass-interference-deande-hopkins-houston-texans/4225076002/">that no-call was ridiculous</a>.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>But regardless of that call, the Texans were a big disappointment on Sunday.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>Oh, man. So much for the Deshaun Watson vs. Lamar Jackson hype. Lamar flat-out <i>owned</i> that game.</p>
      <p>I did some research, and this was one of the most one-sided elite QB duels of all time.</p>

      <p>The only one more brutal was <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200412050phi.htm">Donovan McNabb owning Brett Favre</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>That was one of the more embarrassing head coaching displays I can ever remember. Watson <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/deshaun-watson-knew-he-had-problems-he-fixed-them-in-week-5/">reverted to all of his bad habits</a>, holding the ball too long and getting hit on a ton of plays, in addition to the repeated sacks. Bill O’Brien really holds this team back — and especially this offense.</p>
      <p>I’d way rather play the Texans coached by O’Brien in the playoffs than the Bills.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>I remember that <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199001140sfo.htm">Joe Montana vs. Jim Everett game</a> in 1990. This didn’t quite feel like that for some reason.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>That was a playoff game — <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199001140sfo.htm">the NFC championship</a>. Watson had better hope he shows up more if the Texans and Ravens end up facing off again in the playoffs!</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>I was at that <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200301040nyj.htm">Chad Pennington-Peyton Manning game</a>. Pennington would probably be on his way to the Hall of Fame if he hadn’t <a href="https://www.ganggreennation.com/2013/3/27/4154264/new-york-jets-what-if-wednesday-what-if-chad-pennington-hadnt-gotten">ripped up his shoulder</a>. He was great, but then it ended, savagely.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>I’m reeling from the Pennington HOF talk.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>Deal with it!</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>I agree, Mike.</p>
      <p><b>joshua.hermsmeyer: </b>Incredible.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>He had a 40.6 percent <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/qb/2002">Defense-adjusted Value Over Average rating</a> in 2002!</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>The only guy to <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/">win a division from Brady</a> (before and after his shoulder was destroyed) — and he did it <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PennCh01.htm">twice, with different teams</a>.</p>
      <p><b>sara.ziegler: </b>Wow, I was not expecting to talk about Chad Pennington at all today, much less make a case for the Hall of Fame for him.</p>
      <p><b>Salfino: </b>It’s a hypothetical, noninjury, multiverse case, to be clear.</p>
      <p><b>neil: </b>LOL</p>
