      <p>The Notes app on your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_change-notes-settings-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-with-64gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-black%2F6223303.p%3FskuId%3D6223303">iPhone</a> is a great way to stay organized. You can also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-share-notes-on-iphone">share notes with friends</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-sync-notes-from-iphone-to-mac">sync across multiple devices</a> using <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/icloud">iCloud</a>.</p>
      <p>Regardless of how, or how often, you use Notes, you may want to adjust your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/settings">Settings</a> to personalize the app. These adjustments are all found in the Settings app on your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_change-notes-settings-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-with-64gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-black%2F6223303.p%3FskuId%3D6223303">iPhone</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with adjusting how notes are sorted, you can change how new notes start – changing the title, headings, subheadings, and body text. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-wont-my-iphone-update-to-ios-13">iOS 13 update</a> automatically switched notes to start with a large, bold title. If you noticed this change and you’d like to switch back to starting with normal body text, you can also learn how to do so here.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to make that change, along with others.</p>

      <p><b>3.</b> This will bring you to your Notes settings. You’ll find options to allow Notes to use Siri, change your default account, require a password to view locked notes, and change the “Viewing” settings for how notes are sorted.</p>

      <p><b>4.</b> If you scroll to the “Viewing” section, you’ll find several options to change how your Notes look. Tap on each tab to change the current selection. For example, you can choose to sort notes by the date edited, date created, or the title. Tap the blue arrow in the upper left hand corner to return to the main list.</p>

      <p><b>5.</b> You can also choose to start new notes with a title, heading, subheading, or body text. Prior to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-wont-my-iphone-update-to-ios-13">iOS 13 update</a>, all notes started with standard body text. The update changed all notes to start with a title. Tap “New Notes Start With” to change the setting to your preferred text size. A blue checkmark should appear next to your new selection.</p>

      <p><b>6.</b> For checklists within your lists, you can change the settings to sort checked items manually or automatically move items to the bottom of the list as they are completed.</p>
      <p><b>7.</b> You can also change how your text looks when using the handwriting feature in notes. There are several line or grid styles to choose from.</p>

      <p><b>8.</b> The last setting allows you to access notes from your lock screen, a feature usually turned off. Settings gives you the option to always create a new note or to resume your last note without unlocking your phone. This is especially helpful if you frequently jot down notes while you’re on the go.</p>

      <p><b>9.</b> Finally, there are two toggles you have the option to switch on or off. The first, “‘On my iPhone’ Account,” allows you to store notes only on your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_change-notes-settings-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-with-64gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-black%2F6223303.p%3FskuId%3D6223303">iPhone</a>. The second, “Save to Photos” allows you to save photos and videos taken in Notes to your Photos. Tap or swipe to switch toggles from gray (off) to green (on).</p>
