      <h1>Manchester City to hijack Inter Milan's move for Stefano Sensi?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> could reportedly attempt to sign Italian midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stefano-sensi/"><b>Stefano Sensi</b></a> from under the noses of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/"><b>Inter Milan</b></a> at the end of the 2019-20 campaign.</h2>

      <p>The 24-year-old is currently on loan at Inter from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/sassuolo/"><b>Sassuolo</b></a> and has starred for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-conte/"><b>Antonio Conte</b></a>'s side this season, scoring three times and contributing four assists in 10 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Inter are thought to have a Â£22m deal in place to sign the midfielder permanently next summer, but according to <i>Calciomercato</i>, City could attempt to hijack the move.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Citizens boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a> is a huge fan of the Italy international, who could be at the centre of a transfer scramble at the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Barcelona <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/transfer-talk/news/barcelona-eye-summer-swoop-for-stefano-sensi_376521.html">are also thought</a> to be considering a move in next summer's transfer window.</p>
      <p>Sensi has not featured for Inter in Serie A since the start of October due to an abductor problem.</p>
