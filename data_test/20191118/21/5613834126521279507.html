      <h1>Patrick Wilson Talks ‘The Conjuring 3’; “It’s Definitely a Different Beast”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:24:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/john-squires/" target="_blank">John Squires</a></address>
      <p>In the wake of reprising the roles of Ed and Lorraine Warren in this year’s side story <i>Annabelle Comes Home</i>, <b>Patrick Wilson</b> and<b> Vera Farmiga</b> will also return next Halloween season for<b><i> The Conjuring 3</i></b>, which filmed earlier this year. This time around,<b> James Wan</b> has handed the reigns to director <b>Michael Chaves</b> (<i>The Curse of La Llorona</i>), a first for the franchise’s main films.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/midway-star-patrick-wilson-his-aquaman-2-future-1254563">Speaking with THR recently</a>, Wilson teased the “different beast” we’re in store for.</p>
      <p>“<i>It’s a much different feel</i>,” Wilson told the site. “<i>It’s still the same bones; it’s still very much Ed and Lorraine. <b>Again, we are pushing our characters to places they haven’t gone, but the film will be a really nice addition because it’s definitely a different beast.</b> Pun intended</i>.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “<i>It was really, really exciting. Because of the spinoffs, when you come back to the flagship movies, I want to feel like, “OK, now we’re back in the Conjuring world.” There’s a different weight to those movies just in scope alone, budget, time to shoot it and all that stuff. It’s got great producers, and honestly, a super happy and supportive studio. So it’s a lot of positivity even though you’re dealing with a lot of negative demons. I can’t wait</i>.”</p>
      <blockquote><i>The Conjuring 3</i> will be about a man on trial for murder who claims he was possessed by a demon.</blockquote>
      <p>Producer James Wan recently said of the real-life case, “<i>I think it’s the first time in America’s history where the defendant used possessions as a reason… as an excuse</i>.”</p>
      <p><i>The Conjuring 3</i> is set for release on <b>September 11, 2020</b>.</p>
