      <p>The Pechersk District Court of Kyiv rejects prosecutors' motion to hold Ukreximbank Board Chief Oleksandr Hrytsenko in custody and allowed the suspect to be released on a UAH 3 million (roughly US$124,000) pledge, an UNIAN correspondent reported citing Hrytsenko's lawyer, Denis Demyn.</p>
      <p>The court chose a rather soft preventive measure compared to that required by the prosecutor's office, which was custody remand with an alternative of a UAH 100 million bail.</p>
      <p>The lawyer emphasized that the court imposed a preventive measure in the form of a pledge of UAH 3 million, which Hrytsenko must pay within five days.</p>
      <p>He assured that the pledge will be deposited, while Hrytsenko was released from the courtoom and "went home."</p>
      <p><b>UNIAN memo</b>. Head of the Board of the state-owned Ukreximbank, Oleksandr Hrytsenko, was detained Sunday in a raid by the Security Service of Ukraine on behalf of the Prosecutor General’s Office in a criminal investigation.</p>
      <p>He is being charged with setting up a criminal organization, misappropriation and embezzlement of property or its seizure through abuse of office, as well as laundering of crime proceeds.</p>
      <p>On November 17, prosecutors handed Hrytsenko a 78-page long suspicion notice.</p>
