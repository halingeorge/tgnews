      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:52:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Lee Dixon has instructed the Arsenal players to tell Unai Emery "we don't know what you're doing gaffer, can we change it?"</p>
      <p>The Gunners have been struggling under the Spaniard this season and sit a staggering 17 points behind Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> after just 12 games played.</p>
      <p>Emery has been heavily criticised in recent weeks amid claims the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> players have lost belief in their boss, who doesn't appear to be taking the team in any direction.</p>
      <p>Dixon, who won four league titles at Arsenal and three FA Cups, reckons the Gunners have become far too predictable in recent weeks and something needs to change.</p>
      <p>The former left-back has called on the players to relay this message to Emery, but fears there are no "leaders" in the dressing room capable of challenging the boss.</p>

      <p>Dixon said on The Season So Far: "From [having] a shot at one end to conceding a penalty at the other end in the space of 20 seconds - that cannot happen, that has to stop.</p>
      <p>"Now that game was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> - I could have done [Aston] Villa at home, I could have done Liverpool away when he played a narrow midfield and let the Liverpool full-backs run the game.</p>
      <p>"I could have picked any number of games and done the same analysis and just overlaid it onto the pitch.</p>

      <p>"It's happening every week - that has to stop and the players have got to go 'We don't know what you're doing gaffer, can we change it? Can we change something?'.</p>
      <p>"But there's no leaders in that team, there's no Patrick Vieira to go 'boss can we change the system or something?'. Unai is banging the drum about how he wants to play and the players can't do it."</p>
