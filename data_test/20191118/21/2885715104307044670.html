      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">SHIV SENA</a> supporters staged a protest against the construction of Metro 3 (Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ) and a residential project in South Mumbai on Monday.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena South Mumbai Vibhag Pramukh Pandurang Sakpal said, “We are not against the construction of Metro or anything else. But there should be no violation of rules.”</p>
      <p>Sakpal said that in South Mumbai, the movement of heavy vehicles had been banned, but it was not being followed. “Besides, the construction of Metro 3 should be done at night, from 10 pm to 7 am. But for the last few months, noise pollution in the area has increased during the day as well,” he said.</p>

      <p>Residents complained of noise pollution and parents of schoolchildren said that heavy vehicles continued to ply, making it difficult for school buses to run smoothly, leading to traffic snarls.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena said it had complained to the authorities concerned, but no action had been taken. Sena workers and residents staged the protest on Monday in Kalbadevi and Girgaum. Sakpal said that after the agitation, a meeting was held, attended by Shiv Sena leaders, the traffic police and MMRCL officials. “They assured that the movement of dumpers in day time will be stopped immediately and to manage traffic during the day, extra police personnel will be deployed,” a source said.</p>
      <p>The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation refused to comment on the matter.</p>
