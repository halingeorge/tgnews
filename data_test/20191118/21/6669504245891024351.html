      <p>MADRID - Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil kept rolling on Monday, notching a pair of upsets to lead Canada to a win over Italy on the opening day of the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov, ranked 15th in the world, gave Canada an insurmountable 2-0 lead when he beat world No. 8 Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (5), 6-7 (3), 7-6 (5) in a match that lasted 2 hours 51 minutes.</p>
      <p>Vancouver's Pospisil and Shapovalov, from Richmond Hill, Ont., were scheduled to team up in doubles to meet Berrettini and Fabio Fognini later Monday in the finale of the best-of-three tie.</p>
      <p>Italy made a late change to use their top two players in doubles instead of Simone Bolelli and Lorenzo Sonego in a bid to record a valuable match win in the new Davis Cup format.</p>
      <p>The winners of each of the six three-team groups and the next two best teams advance to quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>Earlier Monday, Pospisil recorded the biggest upset of the day.</p>
      <p>Pospisil, a late replacement for Felix Auger-Aliassime (recovering from an ankle injury), beat Italy's Fabio Fognini 7-6 (5), 7-5.</p>
      <p>Ranked 150th in the world after missing half the season while recovering from back surgery, Pospisil was a big underdog against world No. 12 Fognini.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov and Pospisil both came into the Davis Cup Finals with momentum.</p>
      <p>Pospisil, whose ranking tumbled while missing the first half of the year following back surgery, won a pair of Challengers in the U.S., this fall. That came after the former world No. 25 made a run to the round of 16 at the Shanghai Masters and notched first-round upset of then-No. 9 Karen Khachanov of Russia at the U.S. Open.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov, 20, captured his first career ATP Tour title at the Stockholm Open last month before reaching the final at the Paris Masters.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov fought off three set points in the first set against Berrettini, a semifinalist at this year's U.S. Open.</p>
      <p>The Canadian seemed to enjoy playing in front of boisterous Italian fans, putting a hand up to his ear at one point to encourage noise.</p>
      <p>It was Shapovalov's fourth career win against a top-10 opponent, with three coming this year.</p>
      <p>Pospisil, 29, improved to 18-17 in Davis Cup play.</p>
      <p>Tennis Canada says Auger-Aliassime could return later this week. The world No. 21 was in the stands for the matches on Monday.</p>
      <p>Canada is without world No. 31 Milos Raonic (back).</p>
      <p>It is the first year of the Davis Cup Finals, a week-long event in a neutral venue.</p>
      <p>The old format had the competition run over several weekends during a full-year cycle. Previously, ties were best-of-five contests played at the home of one of the competing teams.</p>
      <p>Canada, the United States and Italy are in Group F.</p>
      <p>Canada faces the U.S., on Tuesday.</p>
