      <p>In the spring and summer, a long holiday weekend might mean going to the beach or a cookout, or at least feeling obligated to do something outside. But when it's cold out, a holiday weekend is all about piling on some blankets and watching TV shows or movies until it's time to eat again. So if you're looking for something to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/12-thanksgiving-2019-movies-to-see-after-youve-cleared-the-table-19207006">watch on Netflix this Thanksgiving, these family saga movies</a> are great candidates — either for watching with family, or for watching alone while you hide from family.</p>
      <p>Thanksgiving is known for being a dramatic time for families — or at least a time where you might get sick of being around people — so maybe you'll just need everyone to shut up for two hours and watch <i>Mamma Mia!</i>. Or maybe you need to feel like your family at least doesn't have the same multi-generational weirdness that's in <i>Rumor Has It</i>. Or, hey, you probably aren't searching through the Ozarks for your missing dad, but that story in<i> Winter's Bone</i> does make for a solid film worth digging into.</p>
      <p>Whether you're looking for a comedy, a drama, a thriller, or an animated movie that will make anyone who watches it cry, the following movies about families are available on Netflix now.</p>
      <h3>'20th Century Women'</h3>

      <p><i>20th Century Women</i> is a dramedy about Dorothea (Annette Bening), who lives with her teenage son, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), and the two people who board with them (Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup). Dorothea enlists them both to impart wisdom to her son, who, in 1979, is growing up in a world far different than the one she remembers.</p>
      <h3>'Coco'</h3>
      <p>Pixar on YouTube</p>

      <h3>'Dumplin''</h3>
      <p>Netflix on YouTube</p>

      <h3>'Mamma Mia!'</h3>
      <p>Movieclips Classic Trailers on YouTube</p>
      <p>Sure, <i>Mamma Mia! </i>is a musical filled with ABBA songs, but it's definitely a family saga, too, as Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) tries to figure out who her real father is (Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård, or Colin Firth) without telling her mother (Meryl Streep).</p>
      <h3>'My Sister's Keeper'</h3>

      <h3>'Winter's Bone'</h3>
      <p>RoadsideFlix on YouTube</p>
      <p>In <i>Winter's Bone</i>, a teenager named Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) has to search through rural Missouri for her missing father, because her family's home will be taken away if he doesn't show up for a court date.</p>

      <h3>'Something's Gotta Give'</h3>
      <p>glows on YouTube</p>
      <p>It's the story of what happens when a woman's (Diane Keaton) 29-year-old daughter (Amanda Peet) starts dating a 60-something-year-old man (Jack Nicholson), but then she falls for the man instead... while also dating a doctor (Keanu Reeves).</p>
      <p>Here's hoping that any family drama you encounter this holiday season is as exciting as being in a love triangle with Keanu Reeves.</p>
