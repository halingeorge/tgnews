      <p>Based on a statement by a <a href="https://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/911921.htm">Strategy Analyst</a>, Apple will most likely be releasing<b> up to three 5G-capable flagship smartphones</b> by the year 2020. This is most likely due to the fact that smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung, Huawei, vivo and more have already started offering smartphones to the masses while Apple is still <b>a little behind in terms of providing a 5G-capable iPhone to the masses</b>.</p>
      <p>With that said, <a href="https://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/911921.htm">cnbeta.com</a> mentioned that Apple will most likely be using Qualcomm’s 5G modem for the time being until they’ve managed to develop their very own modem. With all that said, do take every bit of information with a grain of salt due to the fact that Apple has yet to comment on the subject.</p>
