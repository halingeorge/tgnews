      <p>Police managed to bust two drug dealers after a shoplifter unwittingly led detectives to cocaine den.</p>
      <p>Officers turned up to search the house in Merthyr Tydfil after a thief had been caught nicking from a clothes shop in the town.</p>
      <p>Police arrived expecting to find stolen goods - but instead stumbled upon more than £10,000 worth of crack cocaine.</p>
      <p>During the search, officers also seized cash and other drug paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>Police's unexpected visit came as something of a shock to Jordan Donaghue, 28, and Samuel Thomas, 31 - who were later charged with possession with intent of a class A drug.</p>
      <p>The pair were subsequently arrested and taken into custody.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Tom Evans, of the Priority Policing Team, said: “It certainly wasn’t what we were expecting to find, but we’ll always take a little luck in the fight against drugs.</p>
      <p>“It was a sizeable amount of crack cocaine and I’m in no doubt these pair were significant suppliers in the area.</p>
      <p>“Crack cocaine is highly addictive, it causes psychosis, and brings misery upon users and their families."</p>
      <p>Both men were sentenced at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/merthyr-tydfil-crown-court">Merthyr Crown Court</a> on November 12.</p>
      <p>Donaghue, of Mitchell Crescent, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/merthyr-tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a> was jailed for three years and Thomas, of Fifth Avenue, Galon Uchaf, Merthyr Tydfil, was jailed for four years.</p>
      <p>Detective Evans added: "The suffering inflicted by these two men is undoubted and now they will spend Christmas in prison which is where they belong.</p>
      <p>“And rest assured that any profits they’ve made from the sale of drugs, we’ll aim to seize under the Proceeds of Crime Act.”</p>
