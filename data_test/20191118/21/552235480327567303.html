      <h1>Review: NFS Heat is part of a franchise that never fails to set pulses racing</h1>
      <h2>Need for Speed has been around for a long time and now with it's latest offering could be as close ever to the all time classic NFS Underground</h2>

      <p>Need for Speed is one of those franchises that's been kicking about for ages, quite rightly because since the NFS Underground series back in 2003 the game has went from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>EA's recent foray into first person narratives have been brilliant, like The Journey on FIFA in the past and the new Volta storyline on FIFA 20 and 2017's NFS: Payback was a great addition to that, but now EA and Ghost Games have added to it with this storyline and style that blows Payback completely out of the water.</p>

      <p>Driving around Palm City, which is a fictionalised take on Miami, Florida, you cant help but feel an 80's nostalgic feel with all the neon and shiny metal around the map with features including mountainous areas and open fields as well as highly populated city scapes.</p>
      <p>The storyline could be taken from any number of films involving street racing so best leave that for you to explore but needless to say it's great, and includes a lot of police involvement which is something you don't necessarily want while street racing at night.</p>

      <p>The day/night cycle from Payback is gone and instead players have the chance to choose and when their players will interact with the map, racing for bank or cash during the day to help buy performance upgrades and kits for your current car or racing at night which earns you rep, which is a truer reflection of your standing in the game and how the police react to you while being chased.</p>

      <p>With nearly 130 cars in game as well as the long awaited return of the Ferrari name, NFS:Heat should be a great adventure for car enthusiasts and gamers alike with huge set pieces that will keep you excited right up until the end.</p>
