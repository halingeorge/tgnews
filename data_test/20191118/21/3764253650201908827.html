      <p>Everybody in one way or the other fulfils their destiny no matter what challenges fate throws their way. The story of Freddie Figgers is one that perfectly fits that description.</p>
      <p>According to InspireMore, just shortly after his mother gave birth to him, she dumped him in a trash can in what can be described as utter heartlessness.</p>
      <p>Freddie conquered his uninspiring beginning and became a shining star at 29 years for many who dream of true success.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that Nathan and Betty Figgers came as his angels as they adopted him when he was a two-day-old baby. Their love and support were everything he needed to grow into what destiny already had planned for him.</p>

      <p>It was said that since when he was young, he has been known to be very much given to deep thinking and commanded so much intelligence for his age.</p>
      <p>At the age of nine, young Freddie got his first computer. Though the computer was in a bad shape, he did not allow that to deter him as he fixed it up. He would years later at 12 get his first job as a computer technician.</p>
      <p>When he was 15, he launched his first cloud computing services, a business that started when he helped an Alabama car dealership store his files on a remote service to prevent a repeated loss of data.</p>
      <p>Among his proud innovation was the shoe he made for his adopted father when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. He was able to create a device that worked as a GPS and a two-way straight communicator, an idea he later sold for a Kansas company for $2.2 million (N723,000,000)</p>
