      <h1>Another Irish American leaves Trump's administration</h1>

        <b>Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, asked by Trump administration to leave his post.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yet another Irish American name is making a surprising departure from President Donald Trump’s government. Matthew Doherty was appointed as the executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness in 2015 but stayed in the role to serve under Trump. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7695745/Trump-administration-ousts-homelessness-official-plan-crackdown-streets.html">In an email announcement</a>, however, Doherty revealed that he left his position at the request of the Trump administration. His email to coworkers stated that the administration  “no longer wishes to have me.”</p>

      <p>“It has been an incredible honor to serve at USICH, and I do feel like I am leaving on my own terms,” Doherty said. </p>
      <p>“I believe that I have been able to keep my integrity intact; but, they have now told me to pack my things up and go.”</p>

      <p>Doherty’s departure is surprising as President Trump recently announced his desire to solve the country’s homelessness crisis but as of yet, has failed to release a plan. Created in 1987, the USICH works to coordinate the federal government's response to homelessness across 19 agencies, including the Housing and Urban Development, Education, and Labor and Commerce departments. </p>
      <p>It is not clear who will be replacing Doherty. </p>
