      <h1>Fate Of Taylor Swift’s AMAs Performance Still In Doubt Following Conflicting Statements About Song Rights (UPDATE)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:58:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Fu</a></address>
      <p><b>UPDATE 11-19-19:</b> <i>American Music Awards producer Dick Clark Productions denied a <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/taylor-swift-amas-big-machine-dick-clark-productions-reach-agreement-1203408043/">previous statement from Big Machine Records</a> claiming that the two parties had reached an agreement over the performance rights to Swift’s old music.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” it said. “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>This seems to throw Big Machine Records' entire previous claim about reaching a deal with the show for Swift to perform her older songs into doubt. Swift went public with her conflict with Big Machine Records last week, saying the company was blocking her from performing her old songs on the show because of a dispute over her plans to re-record her old material once she’s contractually allowed to next year. BMR controls the masters to all of Swift’s pre-</i>Lover<i> material, and it’s currently unclear if Swift will be able to perform any of her older songs at the AMAs. The show will air on ABC this Sunday, Nov. 24 at 8 p.m. ET.</i></p>

      <hr/>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> claimed Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine Records had <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-s-conflict-with-scooter-braun-big-machine-records-escalates-amidst-licensing-royalties-disputes">denied her the right to perform any of her old songs</a> at the upcoming American Music Awards. Big Machine Label Group responded with a statement stating they weren’t blocking her performance, but didn’t address whether the label was specifically preventing Swift from playing her older material. According to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/taylor-swift-amas-big-machine-dick-clark-productions-reach-agreement-1203408043/"><i>Variety</i></a>, Swift now has the go-ahead to play her old songs on Sunday after Big Machine informed AMAs producers Dick Clark Productions that all BMLG artists are cleared to perform on the show.</p>
      <p>Big Machine issued the following statement:</p>
      <blockquote>The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms. This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performances. It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.</blockquote>
      <p>This latest dispute between Swift and her old record label is centered around Big Machine’s ownership of her masters, which she later plans to get around by <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-plans-to-re-record-her-old-songs-to-combat-scooter-braun-deal">re-recording her old music</a> once she is contractually allowed to do so in November 2020. As <i>Variety</i> points out, a West Coast broadcast of a live show like the AMAs could arguably be considered a re-recording of a song.</p>
      <p>Swift has also alleged that Braun and Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta denied her request to use her old music and video footage in a planned Netflix documentary, which is now on hold. A rep for the singer <a href="https://twitter.com/joecoscarelli/status/1195359447067103236/photo/3">provided an email to <i>The New York Times</i></a> from a Big Machine executive dated October 28, which says that the label “will not agree to issue licenses for existing recordings or waivers of its rerecording restrictions in connection with” the documentary.</p>
      <p>Big Machine and Swift also claim that each party owes the other money. The label says the singer “has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company,” while a rep for Swift claimed Big Machine owes her “$7.9 million dollars [sic] of unpaid royalties over several years.”</p>
      <p>The conflict first came to a head when Swift called <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-on-scooter-braun-acquiring-her-back-catalog-this-is-my-worst-case-scenario">Braun’s acquisition of Big Machine Records</a> her “worst case scenario,” expressing dissatisfaction with the transfer of the rights to the master recordings of her vast and lucrative back catalog of music to someone with whom she had feuded for several years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Taylor-swift/Lover"><i>Lover</i></a>, which Swift released in late August, was her first album released outside Big Machine Records, and the first to which she controls her own masters.</p>
      <p>During the 2019 AMAs, Swift will be <a href="https://genius.com/a/taylor-swift-will-be-named-artist-of-the-decade-at-the-2019-american-music-awards">named Artist of the Decade</a>. The show airs on ABC on Sunday, Nov. 24 at 8 p.m. ET.</p>
