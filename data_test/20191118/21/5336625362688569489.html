      <h1>Snapchat says, unlike Facebook, it will fact-check political ads</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:01:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/matt-binder/" target="_blank">Matt Binder</a></address>
      <p>We now know Snapchat’s position in the great online political advertising fact-checking debate.</p>
      <p>Snapchat will indeed fact-check political ads in an effort to curb misinformation on the platform, the company's CEO Evan Spiegel <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/snapchat-fact-checks-political-ads-unlike-facebook-ceo-evan-spiegel.html"><u>told CNBC</u></a> on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>According to the company, Snapchat has clear guidelines in place for political advertising, which cover politicians, elections, issues, and advocacy groups. Snapchat’s policies ban political advertising that intends to mislead, deceive, or violate the company’s terms of service.</p>
      <p>“We subject all advertising to review, including political advertising,” said Spiegel to CNBC. “I think what we try to do is create a place for political ads on our platform, especially because we reach so many young people and first-time voters we want them to be able to engage with the political conversation, but we don’t allow things like misinformation to appear in that advertising.” </p>
      <p>Snapchat’s process involves a human compliance review of every ad, not just political ones, by an internal team. The company says only a small number of advertisements have been rejected under this process.</p>
      <p>On CNBC, Spiegel compared the company’s policy to those of cable TV networks, which are not required to adhere to the FCC's rules that don't allow broadcast networks to prohibit political ads based on accuracy.</p>
      <p>The social messaging app has become an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/technology/snapchat-voter-registration-midterms.html"><u>increasingly</u></a> political venue over the years. Snapchat has been utilized to register new voters and increase engagement between politicians and their constituents. </p>
      <p>Snapchat is the latest company to chime in on the political advertising debate after Facebook’s <a href="https://mashable.com/article/facebook-elections-political-speech/"><u>controversial decision</u></a> to let political advertising from politicians go unchecked in the name of free speech. Since then, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-ends-political-advertisements/"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-bans-political-ads/"><u>TikTok</u></a> have announced they will completely bar political advertising on their platforms. Google’s position remains <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-weighs-changes-to-political-ad-policy-11573081092"><u>unclear</u></a>.</p>
