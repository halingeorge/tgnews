      <h1>ESPN’s Prediction For The Nebraska-Maryland Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:49:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Nebraska football team heads to Maryland this weekend for a showdown with the Terrapins in a game that is now vitally important for the Huskers.</p>
      <p>Nebraska is 4-6 and in desperation mode at this point. They need a win over Maryland to have a shot at bowl eligibility against Iowa during Rivalry Week. But injuries and defensive struggles have ravaged the Huskers, who have given up at least 30 points in four straight games. They’re 1-6 this year when giving up that many points.</p>
      <p>Maryland has had a difficult season with first-year head coach Mike Locksley at the helm. They’re on a five-game losing streak thanks in large part to an anemic offense and a porous defense. The team has been outscored 163-31 in a brutal three-game stretch against Minnesota, Michigan and Ohio State.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401112210">ESPN’s computer model</a> has released its prediction for the Nebraska-Maryland game.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s computer model believes that Maryland has a slight edge in this game. The computer model gives the Terrapins a 50.7 percent chance to win this Saturday’s game.</h3>
      <p>Maryland won’t get much out of this game other than a chance at an increasingly rare win over a Big Ten team other than Rutgers.</p>
      <p>It will be a battle of two pretty bad defenses when all is said and done. This game may come down to who makes the fewest mistakes.</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 3:30 p.m. EST on BTN.</p>
