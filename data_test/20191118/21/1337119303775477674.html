      <p>Apple will be hosting a special event on December 2nd that will honor the company’s “favorite apps and games of 2019.” The event comes as a surprise; Apple has handed out awards for its apps of the year <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/best-of-2018/">in the past</a> but not with a press event.</p>

      <p>Apple isn’t expected to announce new products, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/apple-announces-press-event-on-dec-2.html">according to <i>CNBC</i></a>. The event is not currently listed on Apple’s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com">event website</a>.</p>
      <p>Apple has been pushing further into curation with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20870146/apple-arcade-launch-best-top-games-iphone-ipad-apple-tv">surprisingly good</a> Apple Arcade and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20936686/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-see-mankind-dickinson-price-netflix-disney-streaming">not-as-good (yet) Apple TV Plus</a>, and hosting its own app awards show is another step down that path. Apple was previously known for determining what many of us viewed content <i>on,</i> but as of late, it’s trying to determine what some of that content <i>is</i> as well.</p>
