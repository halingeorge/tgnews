      <h1>Soybean Harvest Nears Completion While Corn Lags</h1>
      <h2>The Corn Belt’s Northern Edge Still Struggles To Finish.</h2>

      <p>DES MOINES, Iowa – As harvest finally winds down, U.S. farmers are nearly finished combining soybeans but remain behind the normal pace on corn, according to USDA’s Weekly Crop Progress Report released Monday.</p>
      <p>In the main soybean-producing states, farmers have only 9% left to cut, slightly behind 5% that would remain unharvested on this date, according to Monday’s report. Northern states, hammered by early winter weather, are further behind. Wisconsin has only 77% of beans out of the field, and Michigan was at 76% as of Sunday, the cutoff for the report.</p>
      <h3>Corn</h3>
      <p>In its Weekly Crop Progress Report, the USDA pegged the U.S. corn harvest at 76% complete, below a five-year average of 92%.</p>
      <p>North Dakota remains the furthest behind, with 23% of that state’s corn harvested, up just a bit from 15% last week and well behind its 85% average for this time of year. Michigan corn is only 39% harvested and Wisconsin is at 44%.</p>
      <p>Iowa and Minnesota both lag other states in the heart of the Corn Belt, with each having 77% of their corn harvested. Iowa normally would have 93% of corn harvested. Other state totals include Illinois at 80% vs. a 97% five-year average, and Indiana also at 80% complete vs. a 91% five-year average.</p>
      <h3>Soybeans</h3>
      <p>In the major soybean states, the amount of soybeans cut totaled 91%, slightly below a 95% five-year average.</p>
      <p>Among Corn Belt states, Nebraska is closest to completion with 99% harvested — also the five-year average. Iowa leads Corn Belt states to the east in soybean cutting, at 95% complete vs. a five-year average of 98%. Illinois is 92% complete vs. a 98% five-year average. Indiana farmers have 91% of their soybeans cut vs. a five-year average of 95%. Ohio is 90% complete vs. a 95% average.</p>
