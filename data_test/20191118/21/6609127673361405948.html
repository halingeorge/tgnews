        <b>A YOUTUBER received racist abuse and someone 'wanted him dead' after wearing a Celtic top during a Rangers tour before visiting Parkhead in a Light Blues jersey.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ninh Ly, who runs the Ultimate Bucket List channel, has toured several grounds around Europe dressed in the kit of the home team's rivals for his videos.</p>

        <figcaption>The Celtic 'fan' was spotted at Ibrox</figcaption>

      <p>On Friday he visited Ibrox wearing a Celtic strip before touring Parkhead with a Gers shirt on.</p>
      <p>Ninh went viral for the stadium stunt and admitted he was treated brilliantly at both clubs.</p>
      <p>He said: "Both Rangers and Celtic were very very nice to me.</p>
      <p>"I concluded that the hatred isn't real and it's grossly exaggerated."</p>
      <p>But despite being treated impeccably on both tours, he was hit with a tirade of online abuse when he returned to his car.</p>
      <p>After reviewing each ground in his video, the YouTuber said: "I'm sorry to report that most of the comments were overwhelmingly negative.</p>
      <p>"People reacted really badly to me turning up to a stadium in a different coloured shirt.</p>

      <p>"Let's make one thing very very clear, I honestly don't care what abuse you throw at me.</p>
      <p>"I died a long time ago so whatever you say doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.</p>
      <p>"This is the problem with football, this unmitigated level of hatred.</p>
      <p>"We can't complain about racism when we are coming out with comments like this.</p>
      <p>"And we can't complain about hooliganism when people want me dead for wearing a different coloured shirt.</p>
      <p>"Think about that for a second. You want someone to die because they are wearing a different coloured t-shirt.</p>
      <p>"Football is not about racism, football is not about secularism, football is not about any form of discrimination.</p>
      <p>"What it is about is what is on the field, that's all it should be about.</p>
      <p>"Don't buy into all of this negative hatred, you don't have to hate anybody to support your local football team."</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to The Scottish Sun Ninh added: "As mentioned in the video, I am a Man United fan and am completely impartial to both Rangers and Celtic.</p>
      <p>"I honestly had no idea what to expect coming into Glasgow on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Both the Celtic and Rangers tour guides were very nice to me, and I have nothing but high praise for both of them.</p>
      <p>"I’m honestly not offended by any of these negative comments, as I understand that people are entitled to their opinions - no matter how vile they may be.</p>
      <p>"But I am surprised at the sheer amount of them. I’m astounded that so many people feel strongly about something that is very commonplace in other sports and in other countries.</p>
      <p>"You could wear the opposing teams jersey in baseball, ice hockey, rugby, cricket etc. and nobody would care.</p>
      <p>"Is that naivety on my part? Possibly.</p>
      <p>"I certainly didn’t intend to be plastered all over social media or be featured in The Scottish Sun!"</p>
