      <p>(Reuters) - The United States should boost spending and take other “aggressive steps” to protect next year’s presidential election from foreign meddling, a group of former national security officials said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Citing what they said were signs U.S. rivals want to undermine the November 2020 poll, National Security Action - a group led by former advisers to President Barack Obama - said states and agencies should invest in paper ballot backups for digital voting machines, ensure audits of election results, improve cybersecurity and boost training for poll workers.</p>
      <p>Election security has become a major concern since U.S. intelligence agencies claimed Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to tilt the vote in Donald Trump’s favor. Moscow has denied <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-election-putin/putin-brushes-off-allegations-of-russian-election-meddling-idUSKBN1WH1CS">here</a> any interference.</p>
      <p>Congress has appropriated some $600 million for election security since 2018 and is working to approve another $250 million, an amount that National Security Action called a “modest start.” Its statement was signed by 70 former security officials from a range of agencies.</p>
      <p>The group noted that the state of Pennsylvania alone has spent $125 million upgrading voting machines that will be used during 2020 elections.</p>
      <p>The former officials said they had “already learned” of attempts by Iran and Russia to undermine the 2020 U.S. elections, though they offered no specific detail.</p>
      <p>The White House had no immediate comment.</p>
      <p>Trump has warned of plans by U.S. adversaries to interfere in American elections, and last year signed an executive order <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-election/trump-signs-order-to-allow-sanctions-for-u-s-election-meddling-idUSKCN1LS2NA">here</a> that would slap sanctions on foreign countries or people trying to interfere in the U.S. political process.</p>
