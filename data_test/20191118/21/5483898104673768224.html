      <h3>Motorists are being urged to get petrol now before a predicted price hike.</h3>
      <p>According to 7 News:</p>
      <blockquote>The cost of fuel could jump as much as 50 cents per litre across the country in the coming days.<br/><br/>The forecasted hike follows a large disparity at service stations in each city, with smaller petrol stations expected to bump up their price to meet those charging more.<br/><br/>As of Tuesday morning in Sydney, the cheapest petrol is $1.24 a litre, with the highest at $1.74.<br/><br/>In Melbourne, the cheapest is $1.27 and the most expensive also $1.74.<br/><br/>Up north in Brisbane, the cheapest is $1.27 and the priciest $1.76.</blockquote>
