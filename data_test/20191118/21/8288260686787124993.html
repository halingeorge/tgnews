      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news | Fresh report claims Man Utd have John McGinn and Jack Grealish on their wishlist</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:06:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:06</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>The John McGinn to Manchester United rumour has taken off again after the Aston Villa midfielder was named on an Old Trafford transfer shortlist.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/mcginn-villa-transfer-man-utd-17089754">McGinn was first linked with United in the summer</a> after a terrific campaign helping <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> to promotion from the Championship.</p>
      <p>It was even claimed at the time that legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson was pushing for a move having watched the Scotland international’s development closely since he moved south of the border.</p>
      <p>No bid was forthcoming then with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">McGinn</a> going on to put pen to paper on a new and improved five-year contract.</p>

      <p>But there is fresh speculation that United could attempt to raid Villa Park after <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-transfer-news-grealish-17267345">McGinn was included on a list of eight players Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side want to sign.</a></p>
      <p>His midfield team-mate Jack Grealish was also part of the group of targets revealed by <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3990703/sources-manchester-united-to-make-enquiry-over-haaland-availability-in-january">ESPN</a> as well as the likes of Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho and Leicester City's James Maddison.</p>

      <p>Reacting to the news, one United fan said: "McGinn moved to Villa for £2.9 million a few months ago and now he is a £50m player?! How much more of a laughing stock can Utd make of themselves should we accede to those demands? It would make the Bebe transfer look like good business! Not happening in my honest opinion!"</p>
      <p>"He’s not worth £50m, but then United have set the bar," said a second supporter. "Firstly by only seemingly looking at signing ‘young, hungry’ British talent, who inevitably come at a premium price; and then signing Aaron Wan-Bissaka, after only one season in the @premierleague, for £50m, when worth half that."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Another added: "Is it only me that thinks Sancho is very overrated? I would take McGinn over him any day."</p>
      <p>A fourth said: "Unpopular Opinion - I'd take McGinn over Sancho for our right wing/right sided midfield every day of the week. Sancho is already a superstar who will be expensive and on high wages...I want hungry players who want to play for the badge."</p>
