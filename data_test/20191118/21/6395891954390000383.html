      <p><b>MEDFORD, Mass.</b> - One of the new Orange Line train cars derailed Monday afternoon while traveling through the Wellington Rail Yard, a MBTA spokesperson told Boston 25 News. </p>
      <p>The train was removed from service at noon, as scheduled, after being in service during the morning hours.</p>
      <p>As the train was moving at a slow rate of speed, the last car of the six-car train came off the rail as it passed over a track switch, according to the spokesperson.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson added an immediate inspection found no significant damage to the train. </p>
      <p>The exact cause of the derailment is under investigation. </p>
      <p>The spokesperson said the track switch where the car derailed is set to be replaced as part of the <a href="https://www.mbta.com/projects/orange-line-improvement-program">$102 million in upgrades at the Wellington Rail Yard</a>. </p>
      <p>The MBTA rolled the first new Orange Line cars into service in August.  The entire fleet is expected to be replaced by the end of 2022. </p>
