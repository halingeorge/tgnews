      <p>An Arizona sheriff's deputy is under fire after being caught on camera tackling and pinning down a 15-year-old black boy who is a quadruple amputee during a disturbance complaint at a Tuscon-area group home. The disturbing video captures the teen screaming and struggling as the officer assaults him. The teen was arrested after the incident but charges were dropped.
