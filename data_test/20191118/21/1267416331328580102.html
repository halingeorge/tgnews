      <h2>The platform has a team that fact-checks all political advertisements</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:22:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Snapchat’s CEO has said that unlike Facebook, his company actually <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/snapchat-fact-checks-political-ads-unlike-facebook-ceo-evan-spiegel.html">fact-checks political ads</a> on its platform.</p>
      <p>This statement comes as tech and social media giants have been facing pressure to address the spread of misinformation on their platforms.</p>
      <p>Facebook has recently come under fire for deciding not to fact-check political ads. Twitter has also been criticized for initially stating that it decided to ban all political ads but is now struggling to determine what is considered political.</p>
      <p>In comparison, Snapchat’s CEO, Evan Spiegel has now said that the platform has a team that fact-checks all political advertisements.</p>
      <p>“We subject all advertising to review, including political advertising,” Spiegel told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/snapchat-fact-checks-political-ads-unlike-facebook-ceo-evan-spiegel.html"><i>CNBC</i></a>. “I think what we try to do is create a place for political ads on our platform, especially because we reach so many young people and first-time voters we want them to be able to engage with the political conversation, but we don’t allow things like misinformation to appear in that advertising.”</p>
      <p>It should be noted that Snapchat’s advertising business is significantly smaller than that of Facebook and Twitter and that there aren’t many ads for the company to review.</p>
