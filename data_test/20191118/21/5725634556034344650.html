      <h1>AVX Corporation Is A Buy, Considering Patent Dynamics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:11:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author">Innovalpha</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AVX’s patent activity/dynamics with patent scorecard, weekly and historical patent value, risk and disruptive scores in relation with competitors and stock price.</li>
        <li>A look at AVX in terms of technical analysis.</li>
        <li>Implications for AVX's stock price.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We take a look at AVX Corporation (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVX">AVX</a>) based on its PCT patent activity combined with a technical analysis.</p>
      <p>In order to understand the methodology used, the reader should read previous articles. The number of patents held by a company is not relevant, what matters is PCT patent dynamics for outperfomance.</p>
      <p>As in previous articles, at the least four factors are taken into account in order to reach a conclusion:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>company’s actual patent value score,</li>
        <li>company’s historical profile with patent scores in relation to its stock price with gap analysis,</li>
        <li>comparison with competitors (is the company an outlier or not), and</li>
        <li>company’s technical analysis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Figure 1 illustrates AVX’s scorecard and display the usual patent scores (patent index, grade, patent value, patent risk and patent disruptive scores).</p>
      <p>AVX has very good scores, in particular for patent value score and disruptive score as it ranks the company 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respectively out of 174 companies in the industry with scores of 45 and 20. However, the risk score is not very good with a value of 81.2, ranking it only 10th.</p>
      <p>The company displays a high overall patent score and ranks it 1<sup>st</sup>, taking into account patent value, patent risk and patent disruptive scores. This is an indication of recent intense innovation activity.</p>
      <p>The overall patent score of AVX is 147.2, which is above average. The company is in Grade B, a very good grade (grades ranging from A to F, with A being the best grade).</p>
      <p>AVX is considered a mid-stage company that is disruptive with growth as well as secure and an innovation star in a second cycle of innovation. It also indicates that AVX is in relation to all companies in the technology sector:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>in 11st position for its patent index,</li>
        <li>in 1st position for its patent value score,</li>
        <li>in 1st position for its overall score, and</li>
        <li>in 10th position for its patent risk score, as well as</li>
        <li>in 2<sup>nd</sup> position for its patent disruptive score.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Scorecard indicates an increase of 47.62% in patent activity in the past year.</p>

      <p>Figure 3 displays AVX’s patent index and stock price over time. Not much activity was seen until the middle of 2017 when it started trending higher and since then has been in a stable uptrend with only some brief moments of moving sideways or slightly declining. This leads to believe that AVX is very undervalued as of now since then the stock price has either traded sideways or slightly declined since the Q4 of 2017 and the middle of 2018 respectively creating a huge gap in between the stock price and index value translating into a buy signal.</p>

      <p>Figure 4 shows AVX’s overall patent score and its stock price over time, Figure 5 its patent value score and stock price over time and Figure 6 its patent disruptive score and stock price over time. The three graphs are very similar and are steadily trending higher.</p>
      <p>A decorrelation between the stock price and the patent value score is identified since the middle of 2016 when the stock price started to increase, however, the patent value score remained flat until the middle of 2017. In the rest of 2017 both trended higher together, however, since then a decorrelation is seen once again as the price continued to move sideways, slightly decreasing while the value score kept moving higher.</p>

      <p>An undervaluation is indicated by the patent value score being way above the stock price since Q4 of 2018 in Figure 5.</p>

      <p>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) indicates that AVX principal markets are: the USA, PCT Countries, Germany, China, Israel as well some activity in Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, India, and Singapore, see Figure 7. Not surprisingly, the USA is in first place for patent applications filed, followed by PCT applications.</p>
      <p>Notable changes can be seen since 2016 when the only 4 markets with patent applications were USA, Germany, China and Israel. In 2017, additional activity can be seen in Malaysia and Mexico with Singapore being added to the list in 2018 and minor activity in India in 2019.</p>
      <p>In terms of patent fields of activity, the top three classes have remained pretty much constant throughout the 5 year period. An overwhelmingly large majority of patents were filed under H01G - capacitors; capacitors, rectifiers, detectors, switching devices, light-sensitive or temperature-sensitive devices of the electrolytic type, followed by H01R - electrically-conductive connections; structural associations of a plurality of mutually-insulated electrical connecting elements; coupling devices; current collectors and H05K - printed circuits; casings or constructional details of electric apparatus; manufacture of assemblages of electrical components</p>
      <p>Otherwise no significant changes can be seen in the past years.</p>

      <p>Figure 8 is a bubble chart showing AVX as outlier on the far right among the Electrical Products industry, with overall patent score on the Y axis and patent index on the X axis (in all the bubble charts below the size of bubble is proportional to the PI index). AVX is therefore a leading company within this industry taking into account patent activity. This is confirmed with the other bubble charts below.</p>

      <p>Figure 9 displays again AVX Corporation as outlier on the far right with overall patent score on the y axis and disruptive score on the x axis. The bubble charts confirm AVX as good investment opportunity.</p>

      <p>Finally, the last figure (Figure 11) shows a long term technical analysis for the price action of AVX. Overall the price is in uptrend since November of 2008 when the low of 7.1 USD was reached and since then the price continues setting clear higher highs every 3-4 years.</p>
      <p>Currently, the price continues retracing from the high of 21.48 USD that was set in July of 2018 and since then has retraced around 39% to the low of 13 USD as it rejected further downside around the area where both 100 and 200 month moving averages are located as of now and seen as a blue and green line respectively. Additionally, from the past 3 lows, a clear trend line can be drawn and potentially used as an entry opportunity with very good risk/reward.</p>
      <p>In the upcoming weeks we will likely see further downside as previous monthly close indicates a bearish momentum to come. This could be used as a potential for entry opportunity.</p>
      <p>Previous major upswing resulted in a gain of around 100-135% and could be used to determine the next major target once the price starts trading higher once again. Considering the current lowest low being 13 USD this would indicate a potential target of around 26-30 USD to be reached in the upcoming years.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we conclude that technical analysis indicates a buy for the company.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AVX displays impressive patent activity with 3.5 stars in patent risk score, 2.5 stars in value score and a decent 2 stars in the disruptive score which ranks AVX 1<sup>st</sup> among competitors for all of the scores indicating a buy.</li>
        <li>AVX appears to be an industry outlier indicating a buy.</li>
        <li>AVX’s historical patent profiles in relation to its stock price shows the formation of a positive gap. Further, patent scores show a steady increase in the past years with positive trend. This represents another buy signal.</li>
        <li>Technical analysis indicates a positive outlook once the current retracement is complete and new highs will likely be made in the next 2-3 years.</li>
        <li>Therefore, the overall rating for AVX is bullish and investors should definitely consider buying the stock.</li>
