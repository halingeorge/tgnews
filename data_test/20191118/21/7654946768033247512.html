      <h1>Bloomberg expressed regret for ‘stop-and-frisk’ years ago, ex-gov says</h1>

      <p>Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/bloomberg-apologizes-for-stop-and-frisk-police-policy/">public apology for “stop-and-frisk”</a> wasn’t the first time he’s flip-flopped on the controversial crime-fighting program, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>Former Gov. David Paterson told The Post Monday that Bloomberg — who’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/bloomberg-files-paperwork-for-democratic-primary-in-arkansas/">weighing a Democratic bid for the White House</a> — privately expressed regret to him over stop-and-frisk during a pair of conversations, including one that took place even before a judge <a href="https://nypost.com/2013/08/12/nypds-stop-frisk-policy-violated-rights-judge/">ruled against the program</a> and while Bloomberg was still mayor.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg first confided his contrition during an October 2012 ceremony in Manhattan that renamed the former Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel after the late Gov. Hugh Carey, Paterson said.</p>
      <p>“I told him that the number of searches were eight times higher than they were under [predecessor Mayor] Rudy Giuliani,” Paterson said. “He said he regretted it. He said stop-and-frisk was over-used, abused.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg reiterated his comments during another conversation in 2015 at a governmental or charity event, Paterson added.</p>
      <p>“Bloomberg told me he had regrets on two occasions,” Paterson said.</p>
      <p>“He felt that way a number of years ago.”</p>
      <p>The NYPD’s use of stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in August 2013 by then-Manhattan federal Judge Shira Scheindlin, who said cops disproportionately used it against blacks and Latinos.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg blasted Scheindlin in the wake of her decision, saying, “What does she know about policing? Absolutely zero.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who left office at the end of 2013, also continued defending the stop-and-frisk as recently as January, when he told an audience at the US Naval Academy that it had cut the city’s murder rate in half during his administration.</p>
      <p>But he made an abrupt about-face and apologized on Sunday during a speech at Brooklyn’s Christian Cultural Center, one of the city’s largest black churches.</p>
      <p>“Today, I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong, and I am sorry,” he said.</p>
      <p>Paterson, who became New York’s first black governor when then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned amid a hooker scandal, said he kept his conversations with Bloomberg secret because “there was a sanctity I had with him and legislative leaders.”</p>
      <p>“It was a private conversation,” he said.</p>
      <p>Paterson also said he never asked Bloomberg to go public with his regrets, saying, “Honestly, I just never thought about it.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser declined to comment.</p>
