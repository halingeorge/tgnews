      <p>Michael Scott never kept his deep-seated hatred of Toby Flenderson a secret. In fact, he publicly declared it on many occasions and even gave him a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/601550/the-office-dundie-award-generator">Dundie Award</a> for his “extreme repulsiveness.” But when Michael calls a mandatory “team-building event” to solve Toby’s murder in the new <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/60370/21-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-office"><i>The Office</i></a><i> </i>edition of <i>Clue</i>, you’ll have no choice but to investigate. The game is exclusive to Hot Topic stores and sells for $49. Though it's currently backordered, it's expected to start shipping again by December 28. You can get your own copy <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9061814/type/dlg/https://www.hottopic.com/product/clue-the-office-editon-board-game-hot-topic-exclusive/11938690.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>In this game, three to six other players will assume the roles of Angela Martin, Stanley Hudson, Dwight Schrute, Jim Halpert, Pam Beesly, and Andy Bernard. You’ll be tasked with finding Toby's killer, the murder weapon, and where the grisly act took place. The winner gets a week's paid vacation, but if the murder goes unsolved, Michael will give up on his team and go home.</p>
