      <h1>Altior and Cyrname to face off at Ascot on Saturday in top-class Christy 1965 Chase</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:53:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/marcus-armytage/" target="_blank">Marcus Armytage</a></address>
      <p>It’s on!  The clash between the two highest-rated chasers in Britain, Altior and Cyrname, will take place in the Christy 1965 Chase at Ascot on  Saturday after their respective trainers Nicky Henderson and Paul Nicholls confirmed their intentions to run.</p>
      <p>On official ratings there is only one pound between Altior (175) and  Cyrname (176), who earned his mark when making all to beat Waiting Patiently 17 lengths over course and distance last February. </p>
      <p>Three other horses, Altior’s stable companion Top Notch, Keeper Hill and  Solomon Grey are also entered for the race over two miles five furlongs  which Henderson is using as a stepping stone, he hopes, to the King George for Altior.</p>
      <p>The nine-year-old two-time Champion Chaser is unbeaten in all 19 starts  over obstacles but has never been a yard over two miles and half a furlong.  However the way he has finished his races recently suggests he might now  need further and, even, improve for it.</p>
      <p>For jump racing fans it is a Super Saturday with another big clash taking  place at Haydock where Bristol de Mai goes for a third straight Betfair Chase against Gold Cup contender Lostintranslation. Others in the race include a second Nigel Twiston-Davies runner, Ballyoptic, the Ryanair Chase winner Frodon and Welsh National winner Elegant Escape. Altior has also been left in as ‘insurance’ should Ascot be off. </p>
      <p>“He’s as well as he has always been,” said Twiston-Davies about Bristol de  Mai. “There have been no issues or set-backs. I think he proved in the Gold Cup that he is the third best horse in England and Ireland and the two Irish horses (Al Boum Photo and Anibale Fly) aren’t coming so he should win.</p>
      <p>“There’s more pressure when you think you’ve got the best horse in the race rather than being the underdog.” </p>
