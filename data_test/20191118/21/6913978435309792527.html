      <p><b>NIAMEY — </b>A leading opposition figure in Niger who returned from self-imposed exile last week was jailed on Monday to serve out the rest of his time for a conviction of baby smuggling, his family said.<br/><br/>Hama Amadou, 69, who had flown home last Thursday after his mother died, "was incarcerated early today in Filingue," 180 km (110 miles) north of the capital Niamey, a relative said.<br/><br/>"He went to court voluntarily and was taken to prison."<br/><br/>A former premier and parliamentary speaker, Amadou has been nicknamed "the Phoenix" for his political comebacks.<br/><br/>In November 2015, he was arrested on his return from abroad and charged with baby-trafficking — a case that supporters said was trumped-up.<br/><br/>He campaigned for the March 2016 presidential elections from behind bars, gaining 17.7 percent of first-round votes behind President Mahamadou Issoufou, who won 48.4 percent.<br/><br/>He was released on medical grounds four days before the runoff ballot, flew to France and remained abroad until his return last week.<br/><br/>In March 2017, 20 people, including Amadou, were convicted in the case, which allegedly entailed smuggling babies from Nigeria via Benin for wealthy couples in Niger.<br/><br/>He was given a 12-month sentence in absentia, of which eight months have still to be served, after time spent in prison is taken into account. One of his wives was also sentenced.<br/><br/>In August this year, Amadou was named by the Nigerien Democratic Movement (Moden), the country's main opposition party, to be its candidate in the next presidential election, due in December 2020.<br/><br/>Issoufou, a former prime minister, has been president since 2011.<br/><br/>His country has a history of political volatility and has only had a multi-party democracy since 1990.<br/><br/>The impoverished Sahel state has one of the lowest rates of development in the world. Three-quarters of the population live on less than $2 a day.<br/><br/>Amadou, after visiting his mother's grave, spent the weekend greeting a large number of visitors to his home, his family said.<br/><br/>They included supporters but also members of the Nigerien government and civil society, who came to express their condolence for his loss.<br/><br/>He even spoke by phone with Issoufou, one of whose wives, Malika Issoufou, went to his home, said a relative.<br/><br/>Analysts said that Amadou's political future remained unclear.<br/><br/>An expert on constitutional law, Amadou Boubacar, said that even if he served the entirety of his sentence before the December 2020 election, he would still be legally ineligible for a tilt at the presidency.<br/><br/>"Under the law, anyone sentenced to a prison term equal to or greater than one year is not eligible," Boubacar said.<br/><br/>"Even a presidential pardon is not enough. There would have to be a law amnestying baby-smuggling in order to annul the sentence."<br/><br/>In that context, Amadou's future could largely depend on a "political dialogue" promised last month by Prime Minister Brigi Rafini, Boubacar said.<br/><br/>A push for reconciliation could favor concessions for Amadou, who since his return has notably called for the easing of tensions.<br/><br/>Officially, the "dialogue" aims at "calming the political climate" ahead of the presidential ballot, with discussions on future elections, Niger's electoral commission and access to the media.<br/><br/>Rafini said an "assembly" of 30 people from Niger's political parties, plus five from trade unions and three from civil society, would be named shortly to conduct the month-long forum.<br/><br/>Representatives from the UN, the European Union, a non-partisan American NGO called the National Democratic Institute will take part, as will local religious leaders and traditional chiefs. — AFP</p>
