      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rylan-clark/">Rylan Clark-Neal</a> is trying his hand at politics after being announced as the co-host for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/channel-4/">Channel 4</a>’s Alternative Election Night.</p>
      <p>Continuing his total domination of all TV channels, all genres and all topics, Rylan will join Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murphy on screen for the eight hour long live event while the results come in for December’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/general-election-2019/">General Election</a>.</p>
      <p>After his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/rylan-clark-neal-collapses-tears-finishes-24-hour-karaoke-challenge-raising-800k-11089417/">24 hour karaoke challenge</a>, we’re sure that eight hours is a walk in the park for Rylan.</p>
      <p>Also joining the pair on screen will be Canadian stand up Katherine Ryan and Clare Balding, while former MPs <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tom-watson/">Tom Watson</a> and Amber Rudd will provide additional political commentary.</p>
      <p>Hoping to bring some fun to what can be a very long and tedious night, the Alternative Election Night promises to be ‘distinctive, fresh and very entertaining, offering up the perfect mix of two political heavyweights who’ve just walked out of front-line politics as well some great comedians and entertainers.’</p>

      <p>Excitedly sharing the news on Twitter, 31-year-old Rylan wrote: ‘So yeah…. This X factor reject will be hosting election night. Lols.’</p>
