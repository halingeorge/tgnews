      <h1>City of Tshwane suspends bus operations following wage disputes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:52:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">Canny Maphanga</a></address>
      <p>The City of Tshwane has suspended A Re Yeng Bus Rapid Transport and A Re Yeng Mamelodi Bus operations following wage disputes, the municipality revealed on Monday.</p>
      <p>As a result, the member of the mayoral committee for roads and transport, Sheila Senkubuge, has encouraged passengers to make alternative transport arrangements ahead of the suspension.</p>
      <p>"All A Re Yeng Mamelodi Bus operations will remain suspended until further notice. We urge passengers to exercise patience during this period as the suspension is a move to ensure their safety and to safeguard the City's assets. We also encourage passengers to make alternative transport arrangements," Senkubuge said.</p>
      <p>This after a wage dispute between Tshwane Rapid Transport Pty Ltd (TRT) and Mamelodi Bus drivers.</p>
      <p>The dispute is in connection with the salary disparity between Mamelodi Bus drivers and their A Re Yeng Bus counterparts.</p>
      <p>The City issued a notice on Sunday urging residents to exercise patience as A Re Yeng Bus operations are set to be suspended ahead of a looming strike on Monday.</p>
