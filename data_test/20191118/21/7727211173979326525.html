      <p>I'm a Celebrity fans slammed tonight's trial, saying it was unfair on Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-im-celebrity-out-here-17272081">The trial</a> saw Kate and Caitlyn in a box 20ft up in the air, with rats and creepy crawlies in there with them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/im-celebrity-host-declan-donnelly-17276160">The two celebrities</a> were strapped into their cages and raised above a lake in the Jungle. "Come on Kate.  Positive mental attitude" encouraged Dec.  "I'm concentrating on surviving" replied the TV presenter as she tried to get comfortable in the box.</p>
      <p>They started the Trial as 30,000 cockroaches were poured into each cage. The two celebrities carefully aimed and tried to drop the balls into the moving basket. </p>
      <p>"I don't know what to do, I can't think. They're going up my noo-noo," screamed Kate.</p>
      <p>After a few near misses, Caitlyn managed to get a ball in the basket.  This was shortly followed by Kate, as crickets and mealworms joined the cockroaches and rats that were already in each cage.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn carefully aimed and a number of the balls just hit the rim of the basket. Kate was less careful but by the end of the Trial both women had managed to drop two balls into the basket making a total of four meals for camp.</p>
      <p>Kate said: "Thank God, thank God," as the klaxon sounded indicating the end of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-im-celebrity-out-here-17272345">the Trial </a> and added: "That was so much more disturbing than I thought it would be.</p>
      <p>"It’s a confined box which I find really scary, it's up very high and then you've got everything you've ever been scared of in one place."</p>

      <p>The pair had to drop the balls into a moving basket, but viewers slammed the trial, as several of the balls bounced out of the basket, with viewers saying they should of counted.</p>
      <p>And many took to twitter to say how unfair they found it.</p>
