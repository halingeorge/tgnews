          <p>Before the ongoing edition of NBA 2019-20 got underway, LA Clippers were heavily touted as firm favourites to challenge for the conference title at the least. It fell down to the identity of the side, one which saw it packed with worldclass and standout performers, players who know just what it takes to succeed at the biggest stage of them all.</p>
          <p>And the side justified the colossal expectations accorded on their head in the early exchanges of the league as well, cutting short their opposition’s efforts by marauding their way to comprehensive and clinical wins to sit in the echelons of the Western Conference. However, the side have ever since then gone on a wayward spiral, regressing in form to find themselves in 6th place in the points tally with the 8 wins and 5 defeats from 13 encounters.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>The side will be immensely buoyed by their previous outing through, a gargantuan 150-101 win over Atlanta Hawks in their foregone contest which saw them snap out of their ordeal of two straight defeats. More importantly though, it was a massive win, one which saw them rip into their opponents and dive into the attacking repertoire at their disposal, a result they’ll be looking to emulate come today’s encounter as well.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, their opponents of the day, Oklahoma City Thunder come into the match with a win as well with the side having gotten the better Philadelphia in a 127-119 win for the side. It took them to the brink of breaking into the top 8 of the conference with the side finally getting their fifth win in 12 matches.</p>

                            <h3>LAC vs OKC Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>Chris Paul from Oklahoma City Thunder is the first player we are chasing in the inaugural fact of our side’s setup.  The 5.4 assists per match the player has returned with has seen him emerge as a key figure for his unit, seeing him layup the ball perfectly for his counterparts and breach opposition defence with consummate ease.</p>
                            <p>From the other side meanwhile we are deciding to venture in with Terance Mann with the player having been accorded a role in the team’s playing 5 owing to Patrick Beverly’s injury. And he’s ensured he’s grabbed the opportunity thrown his way with both hands as well but doling out confident and flawless performances.</p>
                            <h3>LAC vs OKC Dream11 Shooting Guard </h3>
                            <p>Kawhi Leonard ended up missing his side’s last two encounters owing to a knee injury but with the side’s coach having ascertained that he’s set to return for this one, the shooting guard makes an immediate return into our Dream 11 unit as well. He’s gotten 6 assists with the 9 rebounds per tie going along perfectly with them to make the player a regulation pick for this one.</p>
                            <h3>LAC vs OKC Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>The most heavily packed docket of our side, we have three players lining up this department with the two coming in from LA Clippers only. We begin with their top scorer in the form of Paul George, a player whose 35 points per contest are a staggering number, a figure which is a testament to the pulsating and profound displays he’s doled out.</p>
                            <p>Maurice Harkless will be giving him company for this one with the player having filled in the void left by Leonard across the previous two matches perfectly while from the other side our singular pick comes in the form of Danilo Gallinari.</p>
                            <h3>LAC vs OKC Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>Just the one pick over here for us with us moving in with Oklahoma City Thunder’s Darius Bazley. With a price tag of just 6 credits, good time out on the court and pulsating displays being peddled out persistently, the power forward doesn’t need any more explanation for his selection.</p>
                            <h3>LAC vs OKC Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>Ivica Zubac from LA Clippers will be bringing down the curtains on our Dream 11 side for the day. The centre comes bearing a two toned identity as a player, someone who has kept galloping himself in both the dockets of his team’s gameplan to become a mainstay in both attack and defence, a role which will see him bring in a hoard of points.</p>
                            <h3>Star Player</h3>
                            <p>Paul Geroge has been chosen to represent us as our star player for today.</p>
