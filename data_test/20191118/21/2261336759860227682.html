      <h1>UFC ‘BMF’ champ Jorge Masvidal responds to Nick Diaz, says it would be an ‘honor’ to fight him</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Jorge Masvidal participated in one of the biggest fights of the year earlier this month at Madison Square Garden, thrashing fan favorite Nate Diaz in the UFC 244 main event to win the ‘BMF’ title. ‘Gamebred’ is open to an immediate rematch Diaz, but the 35-year-old appears to be looking for an even bigger fight against Nate’s old brother Nick Diaz.</p>
      <p>Diaz called out Masvidal in a now hugely popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUAlYvPjU4o&amp;t=36s">ESPN interview</a> and followed up on Instagram, urging the newly-crowned champ to give the fans what they want to see.</p>
      <p>“Thank you @arielhelwani for letting me come on had a long week I was a little worked up,” Diaz posted earlier this week. “@gamebredfighter @ufc give the fans that Real shit what they wanna see.”</p>
      <p>Masvidal soon got word of Diaz’ post and responded to the former Strikeforce welterweight champ via Instagram, telling the quasi-retired star that it would be an ‘honor’ to fight him (<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/jorge-masvidal-nick-diaz-express-interest-in-fight-on-social-media/">h/t MMA News</a>).</p>

      <p>“Would be a honor. I’m [100 percent] in for this #theresurrection,” Masvidal wrote in the comments.</p>
      <p>Diaz, 36, last fought in the Octagon back in January, 2015 where he dropped a unanimous decision to Anderson Silva in the UFC 183 main event. The result was overturned to a No Contest (NC), however, after it was revealed that Silva tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Diaz also tested positive for marijuana metabolites and was subsequently suspended for five years by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (later reduced to 18 months).</p>
      <p>Despite being inactive for almost five years, Diaz is still one of the most talked-about fighters on the UFC roster. Last week’s interview with Ariel Helwani generated over 1 million views and counting, making it one of the most popular MMA interviews of the last year.</p>
