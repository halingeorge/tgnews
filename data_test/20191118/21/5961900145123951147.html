      <p>It’s time to fess up, and I’ll know if you’re lying: Have you ever used black magic?</p>
      <p>Maybe you’ve hexed an ex? Tried to commune with a ghost via a Ouija Board? Or maybe you’ve crafted a voodoo doll with the likeness of your boss to get revenge for passing you over on that raise?</p>
      <p>No? Never?</p>
      <p>Well, the research says you’re lying.</p>

      <p>Audible has shared a study to coincide with the release of<b> J</b><b>ohn Safran’s</b> black magic-centric podcast that says 52% of Aussies have practiced some form of black magic, whether it be communicating with the dead, casting spells, fortune telling or others.</p>
      <p>To get into the witchy nitty gritty of it, here are the specific stats that show what you mystical folks have allegedly partaken in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>35% have tried casting a spell</li>
        <li>29% have summoned a spirit, demon or other supernatural entity</li>
        <li>A quarter of Millennials (24%) have tried exorcising a spirit, demon or other supernatural entity (including cleansing/sageing a space)</li>
        <li>23% have tried communicating with the dead</li>
        <li>1 in 5 (20%) of Millennials have tried making and using a voodoo doll</li>
        <li>Divination or having your fortune read (tarot card reading, palm reading, etc. at 43%) is the most common occult activity, followed by communicating with the dead (e.g. Ouija board) (27%) and casting a spell (16%)</li>
        <li>If they could readily use magic to influence the world around them, almost half (49%) of Aussies would use it to make more money</li>
        <li>Millennials (12%) and men (12%) are more likely to use magic if they could to make their partner more attractive</li>
        <li>A third (36%) of women would use magic if they could to eat whatever they want and not gain weight</li>
        <li>If they had the power to curse people, Aussies are most likely to select politicians (26%) as the target of their curse, followed by strangers who annoy them (19%) and bad drivers (19%)</li>
        <li>52% would put a curse on someone if they had the chance, with politicians the most likely to get hit with a hex (HA!)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It doesn’t take a tarot card reading to reveal which age group is most likely to have tried pretty much all occult practices: The millennials (we grew up watching <i>Charmed, The Craft</i> and <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i>, what did y’all expect?).</p>

      <p>Are you crystal balls deep in this kind of stuff?</p>
      <p>Go and check out <b>John Safran’s </b>podcast <a href="https://www.audible.com.au/pd/John-Safran-vs-The-Occult-Audiobook/B081CZJ6SK?source_code=AUDOR02811181900HV"><i>John Safran vs The Occult</i></a> for more on black magic, satanic practices and supernatural activity in Australia and around the world.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always been intrigued by black magic, which is why I’ve spent months travelling the globe gathering seemingly impossible stories for my new Audible Original Podcast,” he said.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t going back to the Salem witch trials in the 1600s. They are all modern stories, involving violence and even murder. After I returned home I was surprised to learn how many Australians believe, and dabble, in the occult – although fortunately not the high-end murdery type.”</p>
