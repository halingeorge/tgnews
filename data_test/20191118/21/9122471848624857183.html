      <h1>ESPN Computer’s Early Prediction For Oklahoma-Oklahoma State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:35:09+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The final week of the college football regular season features the biggest rivalries in the sport. Among them is the annual “Bedlam Series” between Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.</p>
      <p>The two teams first met back in 1904 and have played a total of 113 times. Even though OU has dominated this series–the Sooners have an 88-18-7 all-time record against the Cowboys–the competition is fierce and some of the most recent games have been incredibly entertaining.</p>
      <p>For example, Oklahoma eked past Oklahoma State last year 48-47, one year after out-slugging the Cowboys 62-52. Oklahoma State’s last win in the series was a 38-35 overtime victory in 2014.</p>
      <p>The two teams won’t meet until November 30, but ESPN has already put out <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401112121">an early prediction</a> for the game. The computer favors the Sooners.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>Oklahoma has a 76.6 percent chance of winning, according to ESPN’s FPI.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When the Sooners and Cowboys meet in less than two weeks, a berth in the Big 12 title game could be on the line for Oklahoma. Jalen Hurts and company are coming off a huge comeback win over Baylor and will face TCU this coming weekend.</p>
      <p>Television info for the “Bedlam Series” has yet to be released, but should be out soon.</p>
