      <p>A very interesting call for the Wichita Falls police over the weekend.</p>
      <p>This past Saturday, the Wichita Falls police were called out to 1600 block of Oceola. An officer arrived and found William Cruthird. He was yelling at inanimate objects and punching mailboxes and cars. The officer tried to get Cruthird to come near his vehicle, but Cruthird ignored him.</p>
      <p>He then tried to go into a house and the officer had to use a taser on Cruthird. He was eventually taken to a hospital to be checked out and then taken to jail.<a href="https://www.texomashomepage.com/news/local-news/wfpd-man-tased-after-yelling-at-and-punching-mailboxes/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook_Texomashomepage.com_-_KFDX,_KJTL"> KFDX reports </a>Cruthird has four previous arrests for assault and others for resisting arrest and carrying a prohibited weapon.</p>
