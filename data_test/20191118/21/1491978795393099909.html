        <i>Though the whole of autumn 1919 was chilly, nothing could prepare Britain for extreme lows of -23.3C</i>
      </p>
      <p>One hundred years ago this month, Britain stood in silence to commemorate the first anniversary of the end of the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/firstworldwar">war to end all wars</a>”.</p>
      <p>November 1919 was – and remains – the UK’s coldest November on record. It was so severe it rivalled January 1963 and February 1947 as the worst cold snap the country had experienced.</p>
      <p>The whole of autumn 1919 had been chilly because of a prevailing northerly airstream bringing Arctic weather to the UK, making it the coldest ever October.</p>
      <p>But nothing prepared the country for the cold snap that struck at the end of the first week of November and remained for the rest of the month.</p>
      <p>In the village of Braemar in Aberdeenshire, the site of the equal lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK (-27.2C, in January 1982), the mercury fell to -23.3C, with similar temperatures measured across a swathe of the Highlands.</p>
      <p>Record lows in some parts of the country in November – across much of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland">Northern Ireland</a>, northern England and Wales – were often accompanied by heavy snow stretching as far south as the Isle of Wight.</p>
      <p>Unusually, though December tends to be colder than November, the following month was mostly wet and mild.</p>
