      <p>A California woman who was shot in the Las Vegas concert massacre died two years after gunfire left her paralyzed, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Kim Gervais succumbed Friday to her injuries from the mass murder at the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival in October 2017, making her the 59th victim of the deadliest mass shooting in US history, <a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/news/las_vegas_shooting/washington-woman-says-sister-injured-in-las-vegas-shooting-has/article_9d90518e-e938-5de5-aae4-1d62964fdf45.html">news station KVVU reported</a>.</p>

      <p>Her family said she was paralyzed from the neck down and the injuries were putting stress on her body, leading her to go into cardiac arrest, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>“When I saw her, you could just tell. She was done,” her sister Dena Sarvela told the outlet.</p>
      <p>Sarvela said Gervais suffered in agonizing pain since the shooting, which left her with scrap metal lodged in her body with the bullets.</p>
      <p>“She hurt. Even though she was paralyzed . . . she could feel all the pain,” Sarvela told the outlet.</p>
      <p>The medial woes made it difficult for Gervais to enjoy her final two years, her sister said.</p>
      <p>“She lost her zest for life because of it, because of the shooting, because of her injuries that she sustained,” she said. “It was hard to be that same person, that we all know and love.”</p>
