      <h1>Boyds to Accept Barneys’ Gift Cards</h1>
      <h2>The Philadelphia retailer will offer in-store credit to customers who bring their cards into the Chestnut Street store.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://wwd.com/tag/barneys/">Barneys</a> New York shoppers may have been shut out from using the money accumulated on their gift cards after Nov. 7, but Boyds is doing what it can to help.</p>
      <p>The upscale Philadelphia-based specialty store has agreed to give the first 250 customers with <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/jay-bell-joins-thom-browne-in-merchandising-role-1203373114/">Barneys</a> gift cards to come through its doors a $250 in-store credit to shop at Boyds.</p>
      <p>“There are probably local people who have outstanding gift cards left from Barneys’ store in Philadelphia,” said Kent Gushner, president and third-generation owner of Boyds. Barneys operated a store on Walnut Street in Philadelphia, which closed this summer following its bankruptcy filing. “People from New York, New Jersey and farther away may come, although I don’t know if people will want to travel all the way to Philadelphia for $250.</p>
      <p>“We are taking a loss,” he added. “It won’t put us out of business. It’s something that we felt we had to do. Barneys was a part of people’s lives and touched the lives of so many people in so many different ways. The way it ended left people feeling exposed.”</p>
      <p>As a result, he felt compelled to do something. “My grandfather, Boyds’ founder, was friends with Barney Pressman and I have fond memories of our family gatherings as a little kid. My father and I always looked to Barneys for inspiration as the gold standard in luxury retail, so I do feel a sense of personal loss. Without question, we’ll miss Barneys, too,” he said.</p>
      <p>Boyds’ offer, which was made public on Saturday, is valid until Dec. 10. Gushner said he didn’t know how many customers had taken the store up on its offer as of Monday.</p>
      <p>Boyds has been a Philadelphia institution since Alexander, Albert and Ben Gushner opened a men’s clothing store in Center City in 1938. The store recently completed a $10 million renovation project and opened a beauty department.</p>
