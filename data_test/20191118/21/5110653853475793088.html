      <h1>MLB free-agent rumors: Twins likely to target starters Zack Wheeler, Madison Bumgarner, Hyun-Jin Ryu</h1>

        <i>Regardless of how hot the Hot Stove Season actually is this year — it’s been lukewarm, at best, the past few offseasons — Sporting News will have you covered with all the trade rumors and free-agent rumblings you can handle.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rumor:</b> The Twins will be actively look at free-agent starters in the second tier of this year’s class, including Zack Wheeler, Madison Bumgarner and Hyun-Jin Ryu.</p>
      <p><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://theathletic.com/1387576/2019/11/18/twins-notes-gm-meetings-jake-odorizzi-mitch-garver-free-agents-coaching-staff/">The Athletic’s Dan Hayes</a></p>
      <p><b>Need to know:</b> How Minnesota chose to approach its 2020 rotation has long been rather fascinating. Jose Berrios is under club control through 2022, but Jake Odorizzi, Kyle Gibson and Michael Pineda were eligible to become free agents after the 2019 season, and Martin Perez’s 2020 option (at $7.5 million) seemed a little steep for a starter with a 5.12 ERA/4.66 FIP. Would they have to replace four starters from the rotation that led them to the AL Central title? The first domino fell into place last week, when Odorizzi chose to accept the qualifying offer extended by the club, so he’ll be back in 2020.</p>
      <p>Berrios and Odorizzi form a formidable combo atop the rotation, but there are still multiple rotation spots to fill. And because the Minnesota offense is so very good, and because the goal for 2020 is to build on 2019’s success and add to that in October, theTwins can’t afford to fill all three of those spots with youngsters or bottom-of-the-barrel free-agent signings. Starters like Wheeler, Ryu and Bumgarner are the types of pitchers who can help a team win games in October, but they won’t cost what guys like Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg will cost. That second-tier of starters is perfect for the Twins.</p>
      <p><b>Could this happen:</b> Not only could it happen, but it should happen. All three would be a big boost to Minnesota’s playoff prospects — getting there and advancing — in 2020.</p>
      <p><b>Potential domino effect:</b> The free-agent market is stocked with starting pitching, from the aces to the guys who just want one more shot at a rotation, and everything between. And you can bet that, when the first few starters are plucked from that group, other teams will be compelled to act quicklyso they get the guys they want.</p>
