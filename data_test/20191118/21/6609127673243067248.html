      <p>It is the second inferno in Pollokshields after <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4940294/pollokshields-fire-glasgow-blaze-devastation-building-collapse/">a building was devastated</a> in last week's Albert Drive fire.</p>
      <p>A Scottish Fire and Rescue spokesperson said: ""We were alerted at 6.58pm on Monday November 18 to a report of a dwelling fire at Melville Street in Pollokshields, Glasgow.</p>
      <p>"Operations control mobilised four appliances where crews were met with a fire in a four storey building.</p>
      <p>"Three casualties have been transferred into the care of the Scottish Ambulance Service and firefighters remain in attendance."</p>
      <p>A Scottish Fire and Rescue spokesperson confirmed were tackling the blaze earlier.</p>
      <p>They said: "We are in attendance at Melville Street.</p>
      <p>"We have five appliances at the scene."</p>
      <p>Police Scotland confirmed they are also at the blaze.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: "We were made aware of the incident by the fire service just after 7pm.</p>
      <p>"We are assisting at the scene."</p>
      <p>Last week we told how a building collapsed in the same area of Glasgow after a horror blaze.</p>
      <p>Shocking photos showed rubble and debris as old tenements in Pollokshields were razed to the ground.</p>
