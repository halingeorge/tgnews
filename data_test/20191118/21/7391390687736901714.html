      <p>I’ve been <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/how-to/a47905/curl-hair-with-straightener/">using a flat iron to curl my hair</a> since the very day I first learned. One of my closest beauty-savvy friends showed me the basics and I perfected the skill by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArvvCtSj2us">flat iron curling tutorials on YouTube</a>. Yeah, there’s a slight learning curve, but once you know how to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Straightener">use a straightener to get curls</a>, you’ll never go back to curling irons again. No clips, no need for gloves, and one tool covers all your bases. The key is to have one of the <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g12837010/best-hair-straightener-flat-iron/">best flat irons for curling hair</a>.</p>
      <p>When you’re shopping around for a great <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/how-to/a52634/flat-iron-hacks/">flat iron that’ll give you flawless waves</a>, you’re essentially looking for three specific qualifications. First, you want something that has <a href="http://www.hairstraightenerstudio.com/size-considerations/">1-inch plates or smaller</a>. Any thicker, and the curls will be so loose, they’ll be virtually non-existent on anyone who has hair shorter than the butt. Secondly, a rounded body is a must, as you’re wrapping the hair around and through the straightener to create a loose curl. Third, you need something that’s sleek and easy to handle, so your hair won’t snag and break off while you’re curling.</p>
      <p>Since a lot of flat irons fit this description, I've pored over the reviews and can say that these flat irons, below, can curl hair beautifully without taking up a lot of your time. Check out these awesome options that make it easy to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fS1zmo34ZU">curl your hair with a straightener</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With nearly 7,000 Amazon reviews, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003S516XO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=1455-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B01JJ69HM2">Remington 1-inch flat iron</a> is one of the most popular hair tools on Amazon. Not only does it heat up quickly, but this ceramic iron comes with an auto shut-off that will turn it off after 60 minutes. With a rounded design and narrow, 1-inch plates, this best-selling flat iron is perfect for curling hair.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "This is a review for those who are curious about this straightener's performance as a curling tool. I wanted a flat iron for my bf's place that could both curl and straighten my hair while being affordable. This is the cheapest straightener I could find, so I was skeptical. As far as straightening goes, I have gotten better results from other tools, but as long as you go over each section of hair carefully, it definitely gets the job done. For reference, I have thick, wavy hair. I absolutely adore curling my hair with this thing. Because the prongs are curves, it gives a nice, large, even curl that looks very natural and sexy."</p>

The 3-D floating plate allows your hair to glide through without catching or breaking, and reviewers love it because it’s durable, reliable, and works on any type of hair — even the most stubborn and frizzy.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "This straightener is everything it says it is. It heats up quickly (the LED stops flashing once the temperature is reached) and it just slides through the hair so easily! What I really like is that it’s very lightweight compared to another flat iron I have used (and put away after trying the MHU one). I’m able to create curls, curves or straighten my hair and the floating plates make it effortless to hold the hair in place. It has 10 heat settings, all reached in 15 degree increments by pressing a plus or minus key or you can go automatically to a memory setting of 390 degrees. Very simple to use, lightweight, fast hair styling - love it!"</p>

      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "This straightening iron is a beast! I use it to straighten AND curl my hair using the technique my stylist taught me. It heats up super fast and it light enough to travel on the reg with. The only downfall is that it gets SO hot that sometimes I need to remember to turn the dial to a lower temperature. I fried my hair the first month I used it because I had the heat cranked up as high as it goes. My hair is already pretty straight, so I mainly use it to curl my hair. With this iron, my curls can last 2-3 days!!"</p>
