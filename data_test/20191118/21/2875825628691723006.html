      <h1>Ireland face Euro 2020 play-offs after Denmark hold brave Boys in Green to draw</h1>
      <h2>Ireland will have another bite of the cherry in March when they contest the Euro 2020 play-offs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T21:39:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 21:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/gavin-quinn/" target="_blank">Gavin Quinn</a></address>
      <p>Denmark broke Ireland hearts once again tonight as they denied the Boys in Green automatic qualification to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Ireland gave it their all in the dying minutes to find a winner after the Danes went ahead with fifteen minutes to go - coming agonisingly close in the final battles after an Ireland equaliser.</p>
      <p>But this was an Ireland performance unlike supporters have seen in years, dominating the visitors for vast periods - throwing the kitchen sink for a late winner that would've sent them to the finals.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's men will have another bite of the cherry in March when they contest the Euro 2020 play-offs.</p>
      <p>The Boys in Green started the better of the two in the first half, with Conor Hourihane and Alan Browne troubling Denmark netminder Kasper Schmiechel.</p>

      <p>There was little between the sides as the game headed towards the break, with the Danes struggling in periods as they lost midfielder Thomas Delaney and striker Andreas Cornelius to injury in the opening 45.</p>
      <p>And Mick McCarthy's men were straight out of the traps in the early skirmishes of the second-half, but struggled to find the killer ball as Denmark soaked up the pressure.</p>
      <p>But Denmark nicked a goal against the run of play with just over fifteen minutes to go as Martin Braithwaite got a foot to Christian Eriksen's cross on a counter attack.</p>
      <p>Ireland pressed hard to get back into it in the final ten minutes, and a goal came as Matt Doherty got up first in a sea of bodies in the box with four minutes to go.</p>
      <p>Ireland fans did all they could to inspire a winner, but time was the enemy as it wasn't to be on the night for a brave Ireland team.</p>
