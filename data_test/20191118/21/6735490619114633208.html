      <p>The Swifties have Taylor Swift’s back.</p>
      <p>After revealing that Big Machine Music Label was blocking her from using her own music in a Netflix documentary about her life and during her American Music Awards performance when she is  named Artist of the Decade, two clever fans came up with a way to send their thoughts on the situation to Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>Haley Spalding and Kyle Graden crowdsourced over $1000 to put up Billboards in Nashville that were designed by fellow fan Isabel Rocha.</p>

      <p>The one digital billboard read “#IStandWithTaylor” while the other said, “Scott, please let Taylor perform her own songs.”</p>
      <p>“Taylor has been singing professionally since she was 14 years old, and she deserves the freedom to use that art,” Spalding told <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/record-labels/8544095/taylor-swift-fans-nashville-billboards-crowd-funding"><i>Billboard</i></a>. “Taylor’s platform is so big that helping her helps every other artist, and we both are really passionate about that. So we wanted to do something besides tweet and post on Instagram and Facebook. We wanted to have something tangible that could start a conversation and that could show her that we’re supporting her at this time.”</p>

      <p>The billboards that rotate along with other ads will run for a week and are located near the Big Machine headquarters.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Monday, Big Machine released a statement noting they have agreed to allow Swift to perform her songs.</p>

      <p>“The Big Machine Label Group informed Dick Clark Productions today that they have agreed to grant all licenses of their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms. It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media.  Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.”</p>
      <p>The AMAs will be held on Nov. 24. In addition to Swift’s melody of her hits, the Jonas Brother, Shania Twain, Selena Gomez, Dua Lipa, Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Kesha, Thomas Rhett and Big Freedia will also hit the stage.</p>
