      <p>Canyon Springs’ football team has been forced to forfeit all of its wins for this season because of its use of an ineligible player.</p>
      <p>The Pioneers defeated Arbor View 24-20 last Friday in the Mountain Region quarterfinals, but it is Arbor View that will advance after the ruling. Both teams were notified of the situation Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Canyon Springs started its season 0-6 but won its last four games. Arbor View will meet Desert Pines on Friday.</p>
