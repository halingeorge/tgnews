        <b>The Google Stadia launches tomorrow, November 19th, and ahead of its launch we’ve put together a list comparing the two services so you can see which you think would be right for you.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spoiler alert: To put it simply, the two services aren’t really all that comparable. While we know plenty about the Stadia, xCloud is still shrouded in so much mystery that implying that either service is inherently superior to the other just doesn’t work.</p>
      <p>What we <i>can</i> do, though, is compare what we do know with what information is currently available to us and make educated guesses about everything else.</p>
      <p>We also have the official hands-on MSPoweruser Stadia review coming at a later point so if you’re into Stadia, keep an eye out for that.</p>
      <p>So, without further ado, welcome to MSPoweruser’s Google Stadia vs. Project xCloud comparison that’s based mostly in guesswork and where the points don’t matter!</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>When is each service available?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Stadia technically launches tomorrow, November 19th. I say “technically” because, unless you’ve purchased the Founder’s Edition, you’ll have to wait until the Base model releases in 2020 to get your hands on a Stadia.</p>

      <p>xCloud, meanwhile, has no release date. It’s currently in a testing phase, but we don’t know <i>which</i> testing phase. For all we know, it could suddenly drop tomorrow or we might not see an actual launch until 2020 or later (although<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-streaming/project-xcloud"> the xCloud website says that it’ll be a “multi-year journey”</a> so perhaps lean towards the latter here).</p>
      <p>That means that Stadia definitely wins in having an actual release date, even if it does come with some technicalities.</p>
      <p>P.S. If you live in the US, UK, or South Korea, you can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-streaming/project-xcloud/">register to test Project xCloud by following the link here</a>. xCloud testing will be rolling out to Japan, Western Europe, India, and Canada in 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Current scores: Stadia 1 – 0 xCloud.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>How expensive is each service?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Let’s be real: price is one of the main make-or-breaks when it comes to buying things. Unless you have your heart <i>really</i> set on something, you’ll probably think it over at least once before purchasing it.</p>
      <p>At the moment, xCloud has no price. It’s completely free to test it out. Having said that, it’s extremely unlikely that xCloud will remain free upon its launch, and the service will most likely have a pricing plan similar to Game Pass that allows you to access the service’s entire catalog for a set monthly price.</p>
      <p>Phil Spencer has previously stated that players can use their own Xbox One as their “personal and free xCloud server.” If we go ahead and read into this, we can take a guess that the service may be free on some levels for those who already own an Xbox One and games. xCloud could also come bundled with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Stadia’s pricing plan is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Founder’s Edition: $129.99/£119</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Contains:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Chromecast Ultra hardware for 4K and HDR streaming</li>
                <li>3-month subscription to Stadia Pro, which offers 4K and HDR streaming</li>
                <li>3-month subscription to Stadia Pro for a friend</li>
                <li>Discounts on Stadia games</li>
                <li>Limited-edition Night Blue controller</li>
                <li>First dibs on your chosen Stadia username</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The Founder’s Edition is the only way to play the Stadia before the base model’s worldwide launch in 2020.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Base model: free</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Offers 1080p, 60FPS, stereo sound maximum</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Pro subscription: $9.99/£8.99 a month</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Offers 4K, 60FPS, HDR, 5.1 surround sound</li>
            <li>Discounts on game purchases</li>
            <li>Certain games are games with subscription</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stadia users will also have to buy games separately on top of their subscription.</p>
      <p>This means that xCloud <i>probably</i> beats out the Stadia in terms of what you get for what you pay – but only if the service does work similarly to Game Pass and lets you access the entire games catalog in exchange for a monthly fee.</p>
      <p>There’s also a small chance that Stadia’s free base model may surpass xCloud if xCloud can’t offer 1080p and 60FPS streaming, but that would also depend on how much you actually care about high definition gaming.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Current scores: Stadia 1 – 1 xCloud.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>What games will be available on each service?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>xCloud does have an advantage over the Stadia here in that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-stadia-now-launches-with-22-games-after-we-all-made-fun-of-original-launch/">the Stadia is only launching with 22 titles</a> while the test version of xCloud currently supports 50. The Stadia was originally meant to launch with 12 titles, so make of that what you will.</p>
      <p>We also know that xCloud will support the 3,500 games that are currently available on Xbox One, with 1,900 more games that are currently in development to follow. So that’s 5,000+ titles that’ll be available on xCloud in the future.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UevfCohbdn4" width="1140" height="641" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Meanwhile, while the Stadia doesn’t have any sort of definite number confirmed for its library, we do know that it’s entered into various publishing deals with certain studios, including Bethesda, Capcom, EA, THQ, Ubisoft, and many others.</p>
      <p>This just means that we’ll likely see future releases such as Elder Scrolls 6 come to both xCloud and Stadia. Stadia may also get <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-stadias-big-exclusive-gylt-may-not-actually-be-exclusive/">some more exclusive games in the future</a>, but xCloud will also most likely get Xbox exclusives. They’re kind of on-par for future releases and exclusives.</p>
      <p>Despite this, we can still tentatively award a point to xCloud here for having over 5,000 games available at some point in the future. Unless the Stadia decides to also retroactively convert some games into being compatible (which Google has said that it’ll be easy for devs to do), xCloud’s library is just… bigger.</p>
      <p>However, as mentioned in the above section, while there’s no pricing currently available for xCloud, we can assume it’ll be like Game Pass where you pay one monthly price in exchange for access to <i>all</i> the games. That means it may have an advantage over the Stadia, where you have to pay for games not included in your subscription. If that were the case, xCloud definitely wins in this section.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <b>How powerful is each service?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It’s kind of difficult to compare the power of streaming services, especially when there’s no physical technology to crack open and poke at.</p>
      <p>The Stadia supports up to 4K streaming – that’s HDR video, 60FPS, and 5.1 surround sound. At the least, it’ll support 720p streaming with 60FPS and stereo sound. It all really depends on how good your internet speed is. Check out the chart below for more information.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://mspoweruser.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stadia-internet-speeds.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We do also know some of the Stadia’s actual tech details (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-google-stadia-spec-and-analysis">huge thanks to Digital Foundry for these specs</a>), which you can look at below and go “ah, this makes perfect sense to me.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>CPU:</b> Custom, server-class 2.7GHz hyper-threaded x86 CPU with AVX2 SIMD and 9.5MB L2+L3 cache</li>
        <li><b>GPU:</b> Custom AMD GPU with HBM2 memory and 56 compute units, capable of 10.7 teraflops</li>
        <li><b>Memory:</b> 16GB of RAM with up to 484GB/s of performance</li>
        <li><b>Storage:</b> SSD cloud storage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As for xCloud, we just don’t know! <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-shows-off-project-xcloud-hardware-in-new-video/">While we do have a video of Phil Spencer and Kareem Choudhry showing off some of the xCloud’s hardware</a>, we can’t say “oh yes, it’ll definitely run at 4K Ultra HD even if your internet is terrible.”</p>
      <p>We do know, though, that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xcloud-e3-demo-16-frames-input-latency/">Project xCloud’s E3 demo had just 16 frames of input latency</a>. You should also be able to use either your own Xbox One console or Microsoft’s specialised Azure servers as a server.</p>
      <p>Because there’s nothing solid to really compare the Stadia to and as we’ve given xCloud two points based on tentative guesswork, we’re just going to give Stadia a point for supporting 4K streaming at launch. It’s not like these points actually matter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Current scores: Stadia 2 – 2 xCloud.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>Where and how can I use the services?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Both services are intended to be used in such a way that you can game anywhere, any time, any way. The Stadia is designed to work with TV sets, mobile devices, tablets, desktop PCs, laptops – if it can support YouTube, the Stadia should be able to run on it. You can also use a HDMI hookup to play on non-smart TVs and devices.</p>
      <p>xCloud currently only works on Android devices. It’s set to come to Windows 10 next year, meaning you’ll be able to stream on your PC, but those are all the confirmed devices for now. It’s likely that Microsoft will also bring xCloud to iOS devices, but that’s still quite a meagre offering in comparison to Stadia’s “If It Can Support YouTube, It Will Run.”</p>
      <p>Strangely enough, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsofts-project-xcloud-will-allow-you-to-stream-xbox-games-to-other-devices/">when xCloud was revealed last year, it was stated that Project xCloud will be available on “any” device</a>. We haven’t really heard much about that since then, though, so we’re just going to have to put a metaphorical pin in it for now.</p>
      <p>The counter argument here is that xCloud can, in theory, be used while out and about while Stadia is restricted to WiFi. It’s not the strongest counter argument, but it may be make-or-break for those with limited devices who spend most of their time commuting or away from a stable WiFi connection.</p>
      <p>As the Stadia supports a wider range of screens while xCloud supports getting out of the house and gaming, we’re just going to give them both a point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Current scores: Stadia 3 – 3 xCloud.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>So wait, which service is better? Which service is best for me?</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Well, that’s just it – which service is better is entirely up to you! If you’re someone who prefers to play games curled up on the sofa, I can’t try and convince you that xCloud is better due to its portability, because that aspect of the service doesn’t really appeal to you. It’s like trying to convince someone who only plays match 3 games on mobile to invest in a hefty and expensive gaming rig because “it’s better!”</p>
      <p>If you already own an Xbox One and much prefer the way Xbox do things, then you’ll most likely find that Project xCloud is a far better fit for you. Just remember that unless you’re in an eligible region, you’ll probably be waiting a while until you can experience xCloud for yourself.</p>
      <p>If you have a high speed and reliable internet connection and want something that allows you to just pick up a controller and game, then Stadia will probably be best for you. While the Base edition doesn’t come out until 2020, the Founder’s Edition launches tomorrow, meaning we’ll be able to get a better insight into the Stadia before you decide whether it’s for you.</p>

          <b>Final verdict:<br/></b>
        </i>
        <b>It’ll be interesting to see where both services go in the future but, at the moment, we just don’t have enough solid facts about xCloud to appropriately compare the two services.<br/></b>
        <b>Check back in 3 years and we’ll re-compare them both (if xCloud is out and Stadia is still around by then).</b>
      </blockquote>
