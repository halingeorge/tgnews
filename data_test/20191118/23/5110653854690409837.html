      <h1>Fantasy Injury Updates: Is Damien Williams playing Monday night? (Updated)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:49:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:49</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Damien Williams is listed as questionable heading into Chiefs vs. Chargers on Monday Night Football from Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. Williams left Kansas City earlier in the week for a personal matter. He's rejoined the Chiefs and should be good to go for Monday night, though. It'll still be worth confirming his status ahead of kickoff, especially with LeSean McCoy still potentially in the doghouse.</p>
      <p>The official active/inactive report drops about 6:50 p.m. ET, and we'll have updates through that time here and on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/SN_Fantasy">@SN_Fantasy</a>.</p>

      <h3>Is Damien Williams playing Monday night?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Williams is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>Williams wasn't dealing with an injury, so the fact that he rejoined the Chiefs means he should be active on Monday night. Last week, he saw about three-quarters of the KC running back snaps, a season high that was helped by LeSean McCoy being a healthy scratch.</p>
      <p>The Chargers allow the eighth-most fantasy points to RBs. If you've waited this long with Williams, you're almost surely playing him, but if there was any question, he should be in your lineup. However, if you were choosing between him and Melvin Gordon, Gordon would be the better play. We'd play Williams ahead of Austin Ekeler, though.</p>
      <h3>Is LeSean McCoy playing Monday night?​</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>McCoy is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>There really hasn't been progress on this front throughout the week. McCoy was an unexpected healthy scratch last week, and Andy Reid said after the game that the Chiefs just want Shady to be healthy down the stretch of the season. With Kansas City's bye next week, could that mean McCoy sits another week and gets a three-week break?</p>
      <p>McCoy playing really just murkies the waters in what otherwise would be a Williams-dominated backfield. We wouldn't want to rely on McCoy in fantasy even if he's active, but if you're somehow stuck with him right now and he's scratched again, hopefully Darrel Williams is available for you. If it's the FLEX spot of your lineup, you might also be able to add KC wide receivers Demarcus Robinson or Mecole Hardman, or L.A. wideout Andre Patton.</p>
