      <h1>Jamal Crawford 'baffled' that he's still a free agent</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:16:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/marcelovilla465/" target="_blank">Marcelo Villa</a></address>
      <p>Jamal Crawford is extremely confused as to why he’s still a free agent almost a month into the season. Baffling was the word he used to describe it.</p>
      <p>“I know I can play,” Crawford told <a href="https://www.nba.com/article/2019/11/15/jamal-crawford-still-waiting-join-team">NBA.com’s Shaun Powell</a>, “and I would think my reputation is still solid. It’s baffling to me.”</p>
      <p>Just last week, the Portland Trail Blazers signed 35-year-old Carmelo Anthony to a contract. Crawford is a bit older at 39, but unlike Anthony, he actually played more than a few games last season.</p>
      <p>Despite not getting many opportunities with the Phoenix Suns in 2018-19, Crawford went out with a bang in the team’s regular-season finale, dropping 51 points in 38 minutes.</p>
      <p>Clearly, the former three-time Sixth Man of the Year hasn’t lost his ability to shoot the basketball, and there are plenty of teams out there in need of scoring. If a team was willing to take a chance on Anthony, surely Crawford can get an opportunity as well.</p>
