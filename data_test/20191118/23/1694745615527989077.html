      <h1>Kick Off Your Shoes and Watch This A Capella Group Sing Lizzo Like Nobody's Business</h1>

      <p>My hair is tossed and my nails are sufficiently checked, all thanks to Citizen Queen. The a capella group — featuring Cora Isabel, Nina Nelson, Hannah Mrozak, Kaylah Sharve, and Kaedi Dalley — recently shared their cover of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/lizzo-ariana-grande-good-as-hell-remix-46806350">"Good as Hell" by Lizzo</a> with an accompanying nostalgic sleepover music video. The matching silk PJs alone would set my middle school self into an excited spiral. You might recognize Citizen Queen from <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Evolution-Girl-Groups-Citizen-Queen-Song-Medley-45710586">their viral "Evolution of Girl Groups" video</a>, and their stunning vocals and on-point beat boxing would make <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Best-Lizzo-Moments-2019-46575245">the "Truth Hurts" queen</a> proud. Watch the group's badass rendition of the hit song above.</p>
