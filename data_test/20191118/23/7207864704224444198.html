      <p>President Donald Trump said Monday that he will “strongly consider” testifying in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” the president <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196425921802178560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196425921802178560&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fadministration%2F470886-trump-tweets-he-will-strongly-consider-testifying-in-impeachment">said in a tweet</a>, referring to his possible testimony.</p>
      <blockquote>Our Crazy, Do Nothing (where’s USMCA, infrastructure, lower drug pricing &amp; much more?) Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they &amp; Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sunday’s DEFACE THE NATION….</blockquote>
      <blockquote>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196425921802178560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>The comment came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/icymi-heres-what-you-missed-on-sundays-face-the-nation-nancy-pelosi-november-17-2019/">suggested</a> on Sunday’s “Face the Nation” that the president could “come right before the committee and talk … or he could do it in writing.”</p>
      <p>The Trump administration is <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/01/trump-campaign-read-the-transcript-impeachment-merchandise/">directing</a> officials not to comply with the inquiry, which sprang up after Trump <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/15/white-house-transcript-zelensky-trump-call/">requested</a> Ukraine’s president investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son’s business ties in the country. House Democrats voted in <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/31/house-democrats-impeachment-trump/">support</a> of an impeachment inquiry in October.</p>
