      <p>A victim of the 2018 Camp Fire, which leveled the town of Paradise, says the blaze destroyed a 500-pound emerald worth $280 million at his home, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/pg-e-dubious-of-fire-victim-s-claim-for-500-pound-emerald">Bloomberg</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The wildfire, one of the most deadly and destructive in California's history, killed 86 people and did approximately $16.5 billion in damage, according to the global insurance group <a href="https://www.munichre.com/topics-online/en/climate-change-and-natural-disasters/natural-disasters/the-natural-disasters-of-2018-in-figures.html">Munich RE</a>. PG&amp;E power lines caused the fire, according to state fire officials.</p>
      <p>The utility is investigating duplicate or "exceptionally large monetary claims, which appear suspicious," according to a court filing related to legal efforts to determine PG&amp;E's potential liability from fire-related losses and estimate damages.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E is seeking to question the owner of the emerald and view the victims’ documents, such as appraisal reports and receipts, supporting the claims, Bloomberg said.</p>
      <p>"With respect to the claim for the $280 million emerald," the company wants proof the owner made an effort to "secure and protect the emerald and documents showing that the emerald was damaged or destroyed," according to the filing.</p>
      <p><b>ALSO:</b> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/PGE-power-shutoff-California-counties-14843042.php">PG&amp;E may cut power to 792,000 California residents this week</a></p>
      <p>The man who submitted the emerald claim also made four duplicate claims of $4.5 million under his and his wife names, according to PG&amp;E. The utility did not identify the man.</p>
      <p>A 500-pound emerald would be one of the world's largest. In 2017, a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/08/09/309-million-emerald-weighing-pounds-found-brazil/">794-pound emerald</a> was unearthed by miners at the Carnaiba Mine in Brazil. It stands 4.3 feet tall and is valued at approximately $309 million.</p>
