      <h3>Eden Hazard has praised Frank Lampard and Chelsea FC for the start they have made to the new season since the Belgian’s exit in the summer.</h3>
      <p>The Blues have been earning lots of praise for their solid performances in recent weeks, with Lampard’s men having won their last six games in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>That impressive run of form has left the west London side in second place in the Premier League table and eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC after 12 games of the new campaign.</p>
      <p>Lampard has been praised for giving youth a chance at Stamford Bridge this season, with the likes of Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham being given regular runs in the first team.</p>
      <p>Hazard left Chelsea FC to sign for Real Madrid in the summer but he says he has been impressed by what he has seen from his former club in recent months.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/eden-hazard-frank-lampard-chelsea-youngsters-11170911/">Metro</a>, Hazard said: “I know Frank as a player, not as a manger, but he’s a great guy.</p>
      <p>“He’s showed already after four months that he can be one of the best managers in the world.</p>
      <p>“The good thing is that they are playing with young players, young English players. For England it’s good, for Chelsea’s it’s good. They are lucky to have young players with quality.”</p>
      <p>Asked if Chelsea FC’s transfer ban was a blessing in disguise, Hazard replied: “I don’t know. Maybe with two or three more players they would first!</p>
      <p>“When I saw them play it’s nice, they all play together. I still have good friends there. I follow them all the time. They are winning at the moment so I’m just happy for them.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action after the international break when they travel to Manchester City on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Blues are aiming to keep their place in the top four this season.</p>
