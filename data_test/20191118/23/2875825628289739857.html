      <h1>Ireland players left dejected after their best was not enough against Denmark</h1>
      <h2>That crucial bit of quality in front of goal was missing - and a draw for Denmark was enough to go through, while Ireland have the March play-offs to negotiate to get to the Euro 2020 finals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:05:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>What left Ireland's players crestfallen at the end was that they had given everything and still came up short at the Aviva Stadium. <br/><br/>Once again, at home, there could be no faulting the passion and commitment of Mick McCarthy's players.  But once again, that crucial bit of quality in front of goal was missing - and a draw for Denmark was enough to go through, while Ireland have the March play-offs to negotiate to get to the Euro 2020 finals after a dramatic 1-1 draw tonight.</p>
      <p>"I need to do better," admitted striker David McGoldrick afterwards. "I had three chances - a header, skied one and one hit my shoulder. <br/><br/>"It's very difficult to take. We gave it our all. We probably deserved to win the game. <br/><br/>"We didn’t, and it’s heartbreaking. It would've been special but we need to think of March (play-offs) now. <br/>We left it all there. We said it beforehand, but we had a little lapse and they scored. <br/><br/>"If this is the only way to qualify, I’d back us here. We’re a tough team to play against and we’ve only been beaten once. <br/><br/>"We haven’t conceded many goals - but we haven’t been free scoring. The Danes don’t want to play us often. We need to take that desire and quality into March and it will be OK."</p>

      <p>For Enda Stevens, who delivered the cross for Ireland's late equaliser, the effort "just fell short in the end". <br/><br/>It was an honest appraisal from the left-back who had his best game yet in green. <br/><br/>"Ah, we’re gutted," he said. "I thought we played well and really pushed, we created chances and it was just the final ball in the big moments that kinda let us down. <br/><br/>"I think all the fans could see we were giving it our all, going right to the death. <br/><br/>"We’re disappointed to concede in the manner that we did. We reacted well we got ourselves back in the game it was just the final ball that let us down. <br/><br/>"We were pushing for it, we were looking for it, we were playing well and the opportunities were there and ball just never kinda fell for us in the box and when it did we never seized on it. <br/><br/>“It’s just one of them, we played well it’s just...I don’t know".</p>
