      <h1>Remember Tamagotchi? McDo PH stokes nostalgia with throwback Happy Meal toys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:59:21+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Manila" target="_blank">Coconuts Manila</a></address>
      <p>Millennials will get a chance to relive their fondest childhood memories after McDonald’s Philippines announced yesterday that it will bring back this weekend some of the most iconic Happy Meal toys from over the years to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the much sought-after freebies.</p>
      <p>As any serious collector would know, the Happy Meal toys were first released globally in 1979, with the toy craze reaching the Philippines in 1997.</p>
      <p>Fourteen toys released by McDonald’s from the 1990s up until 2013 will be available in participating branches across the Philippines from Thursday until Sunday only, giving Filipinos a five-day window to indulge in some serious plastic nostalgia.</p>
      <p>The catch: customers aren’t allowed to pick which toy they’ll receive, but one of them could be a Tamagotchi — the 1990s toy fad consisting of an egg-shaped device that housed a digital pet that you needed to feed, care for, and basically not let die. (Is that triggering good or bad memories?)</p>
      <p>Diners can buy a Happy Meal box for between PHP115 (US$2) and PHP148 (US$3) and expect to get one of the following freebies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>McNugget buddies: Cowboy, Mail Carrier, and Fireman  (1998)</li>
        <li>Hamburger and Dino Happy Meal Box Changeables (1989, 1991)</li>
        <li>Grimace (1990)</li>
        <li><i>Hot Wheels</i> Thunderbird (1993)</li>
        <li>Hamburglar (1995)</li>
        <li><i>Space Jam</i> Bugs Bunny (1996)</li>
        <li>Patti the Platypus (1997)</li>
        <li>Tamagotchi and My Little Pony (1998)</li>
        <li>Furby (1999)</li>
        <li>Hello Kitty (2013)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The price of the Happy Meal depends on its contents, with options including a Chicken McDo, a Cheesy Burger McDo, or an Eggdesal, among others. (But really, does this have anything to do with the food?)</p>

      <p>Since arriving in Manila in the ’80s, the fast food behemoth, referred to locally as “McDo,” has since tuned in not just to Filipinos’ affinity for plastic toy freebies, but also to local taste buds, serving uniquely Filipino favorites, like sweet-style McSpaghetti and Chicken McDo with rice.</p>
