        <b>Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) has been struggling to cope with the pressures as of late in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a>, and as a result she’s sought solace in alcohol. Her reliance on drink increases in the coming episodes, and as a result she ends up in trouble with the law, as she’s arrested on suspicion of drink driving.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With another doctor’s appointment on the horizon for Mick (Danny Dyer), Linda agrees to take Ollie to school — in spite of feeling hungover from the night before. However, as she pulls up to the school gates, she accidentally backs her car into another.</p>
      <p>Linda’s unsure of how to proceed, but — as no one’s seen her — she decided to remain silent. However, little does she know that someone has seen the whole thing.</p>
      <p>Later, Linda exits the school with Chantelle (Jessica Plummer) by her side, but she’s shocked to find Mieko and Shelley — aka the woman Shirley (Linda Henry) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/who-is-shelley-in-eastenders-and-what-happened-between-her-and-shirley-carter-11045443/">punched several months ago</a> — waiting with two police officers.</p>

      <p>Linda makes every effort to defend herself but — nonetheless — the officers insist that she take a breathalyser test, and she’s humiliated as a result. However, matters get worse, as she’s arrested.</p>
      <p>Will Linda get the help she needs?</p>
      <p>What’s more, will she tell Mick about her arrest?</p>
      <p>Later in the week, Mick begins to realise that Linda’s drinking is getting out of control.</p>
