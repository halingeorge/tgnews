      <p>Senior Trump administration official Mina Chang resigned from her job at the State Department two and a half hours <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/senior-trump-admin-official-mina-chang-resigns-after-nbc-news-n1085186">after NBC News</a> went to her spokesperson to ask about newly discovered false claims she had made about her charity work.</p>
      <p>NBC News had previously reported that Chang, the deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Conflict and Stability Operations, had embellished her resume with misleading claims about her educational achievements and the scope of her non-profit's work â€” even posting a fake cover of Time magazine with her face on it.</p>
      <p>"It is essential that my resignation be seen as a protest and not as surrender because I will not surrender my commitment to serve, my fidelity to the truth, or my love of country," Chang wrote in her resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. "Indeed, I intend to fight for those things as a citizen in the days and years to come."</p>
