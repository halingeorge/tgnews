      <h1>FCC may auction portion of satellite TV spectrum for 5G</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:39:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/ryne-hager/" target="_blank">Ryne Hager</a></address>
      <p>U.S. FCC chairman Ajit Pai took to <a href="https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC/status/1196469021358592000?s=20">Twitter</a> today, outlining a plan to auction a portion of the valuable so-called "C band" frequencies for 5G use. There's one potential hiccup: parts of that C-band spectrum are currently used by some satellite service providers to deliver media to ~120 million American subscribers, but Pai believes that a portion of the frequencies can be auctioned and repurposed to satisfy American thirst for data, while still preserving a solid chunk for satellite programming.</p>

      <p>The C band covers a range of spectrum from roughly 3.7 to 4.2 GHz in the mid-band area, placing it in the relatively valuable "sub-6" frequency category. Lower frequencies tend to propagate better, and while there's plenty of space in the higher, so-called "millimeter wave" microwave spectrum, it's these mid-band and lower frequencies that will make the most substantial impact across the widest possible area. That makes this proposed auction, which may open a whole new 280MHz chunk of frequencies for 5G use, kind of a big deal, and a potential win for consumers.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-wireless/fcc-chairman-pai-backs-public-auction-to-free-up-spectrum-in-c-band-for-5g-idUSKBN1XS26C">Reuters</a>, the affected satellite service providers would prefer to be the ones making the sale, selling spectrum from their existing C-band licenses in individual, private sales to US carriers, rather than seeing the FCC open a public auction. The current FCC proposal, as expressed, would preserve the upper 200MHz of spectrum for their use, while opening up 280MHz for auction.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/c-band-critical-5g-race-china">Verizon</a> expressed its own support for the auction in a press release earlier today, though it advised haste, saying, "it is critical that the FCC move quickly to make C-Band spectrum available for 5G... Any auction should include appropriate incentives and protections to ensure it could be put to use in short order." AT&amp;T was a bit more hesitant in its statements made <a href="https://www.attpublicpolicy.com/5g/progress-on-the-c-band/">last month</a>, stating that although the new frequencies will be an important near-term solution for 5G, care needs to be made to ensure that satellite providers can continue operating service (since its Warner Media affiliates use it). T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray <a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1196538675040935942?s=20">expressed his own approval</a> regarding the proposed auction on Twitter.</p>
      <p>In a conference call earlier today, FCC officials stated that the auction proposal will be brought before the commission for a vote early next year.</p>

      <p>Following the announcement, stock for Intelsat SA (one of the affected satellite telcos) has fallen 40% at the time of writing. Given their pre-existing licenses, there's a good chance that the affected satellite providers may eventually try to challenge the FCC's decision.</p>
