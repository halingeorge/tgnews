      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 19 — Not content to remain a video game franchise, <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> is becoming an episodic audio drama in a collaboration between game publisher Ubisoft and Amazon’s Audible platform.</p>
      <p>Riz Ahmed of <i>Venom</i> and <i>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</i> as well as Anthony Head of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> and Tamara Lawrance from TV’s <i>No Offense</i> are teaming up with game franchise actor Danny Wallace to form the principal cast of <i>Assassin’s Creed: Gold.</i></p>
      <p>Continuing the game franchise’s penchant for recreating historical settings for players’ athletic exploration and adventuring, the new series appears set to take place in 17th century Britain, per Syfy’s announcement.</p>
      <p>It follows a street criminal called Aliyah Khan who is recruited to the order of the Assassins and encouraged to uncover the buried memories of one of her ancestors.</p>
      <p>The name, <i>Assassin’s Creed Gold,</i> can be taken as a reference to currency; the United Kingdom used silver coins at the time that the game takes place and, as a high-ranking official at the Royal Mint, physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton was involved in an official recoinage effort; he’s one of the historical personalities to appear in the audio show.</p>
      <p><i>Assassin’s Creed Gold</i> is to launch on February 27, 2020. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
