      <h1>Arvind Kejriwal hits back at Paswan claim that Delhi water is dirtiest</h1>
      <h2>Speaking at the Delhi Secretariat, the CM, who also holds the Water portfolio, said 1,500 to 2,000 water samples would be collected from the city in total — five from each ward — and their quality would be checked and results presented.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:41:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Challenging the Centre over a report that ranked Delhi as the worst city for water quality, Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a> Monday said the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) would carry out its own test based on samples from all municipal wards of the city.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Delhi Secretariat, the CM, who also holds the Water portfolio, said 1,500 to 2,000 water samples would be collected from the city in total — five from each ward — and their quality would be checked and results presented.</p>
      <p>He also said he would write to Union Consumer Affairs Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ram-vilas-paswan">Ram Vilas Paswan</a>, who released the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) report last week, to join officials and media for sample collection from the city. “Politics is being played over water. Paswan said they have picked samples from 11 places. Water quality of any city cannot be declared good or bad based on samples from 11 places. What standards are these? We asked them for addresses of these 11 places; they are not telling us. What’s there to hide? Kuch gadbad hai (Is there something wrong)?” he said.</p>
      <p>Addressing the issue in Parliament Monday, Paswan accused Kejriwal of doing politics over the issue and dared him to name officials for a team comprising state and central government officials for testing water.</p>
      <p>The minister said water supplied by the DJB was not fit for drinking. He said while the rich and the middle classes had ROs and other purifiers, or bottled water, the poor had to suffer. “At many places, water comes in all sorts of colours — yellow, blue… I challenge you (Kejriwal) that you name your officials for a team, which will also have top BIS officials. Let them go to any area, pick samples, and get them tested from any lab…,” he said.</p>
      <p>The BIS had collected piped drinking water samples from Delhi and 20 other cities, including Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata, for testing against parameters including presence of chemical and toxic substances, and virological and biological requirements. Its report ranked Mumbai as the top city for drinking water quality based on 10 samples. Delhi featured at the bottom with all 11 samples failing in 19 parameters, including odour, total dissolved solids and hardness.</p>
      <p>The CM claimed that as per the World Health Organisation’s standards, one water sample should have been collected for every 10,000 people in a city, and based on this 2,000 samples should have been taken from Delhi. He added that the DJB collects 500 water samples every day from different places in the city. Between January 1 and September 24, out of over 1.55 lakh samples collected, 2,222, or 1.43%, failed the test, he said, adding that in October, 96.02% of 16,502 samples collected passed the test.</p>
      <p>“On September 26, Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said Delhi’s water quality is better than European standards. The Union water ministry collected samples from 20 locations in Delhi to come to this conclusion,” said Kejriwal.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Paswan had tweeted that the test was carried out without any bias and that a joint team of DJB and BIS officials can carry out the test again.</p>
      <p>Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had also tweeted Sunday that Delhi was being provided “poison” in the name of free water. Kejriwal had replied to Vardhan’s tweet saying the report is false and “politically motivated”.</p>
      <p>In a tweet on Monday, Paswan said Kejriwal can appoint officials for a second testing. From BIS, DG Pramod Tiwari and DDG (labs) J Roy Chowdhury have been appointed for this purpose. “This joint team can get samples from all areas in Delhi tested in any government certified lab… Kejriwal should also tell his MLAs to say in front of the press that pure drinking water is being provided in their areas. Delhi’s public will decide if what they are saying is true or false,” he tweeted.</p>
