      <p>The 63-year-old was injured on Sunday morning at the home he shares with wife Mary in Irvine, Ayrshire.</p>

      <p>He is said to be in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>One neighbour said: “There were police and ambulances everywhere.”</p>
      <p>Lenny served with the 4th Royal Tank Regiment.</p>

      <p>Cops said officers were called following reports of an intruder.</p>

      <p>We told yesterday how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4964320/elgin-horror-attack-serious-facial-injuries-group/">an Elgin man was left with serious facial injuries</a> after being attacked by a "group of men".</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old was taken to hospital after the brutal assault on High Street at 2am - as cops appealed for witnesses.</p>
