      <p>LONDON, Nov 19 — A midnight blue velvet gown worn by Princess Diana when she danced with actor John Travolta at the White House is being put up for sale, an auction house said yesterday.</p>
      <p>She wore the Victor Edelstein dress when she and her then husband Prince Charles attended a state dinner hosted by then president Ronald Reagan on November 9, 1985.</p>
      <p>It was immortalised when Diana was photographed dancing with Travolta to the song <i>You Should be Dancing</i> from his film <i>Saturday Night Fever.</i></p>
      <p>Estimated at £250,000-£350,000 (RM1.34-1.87 million), the dress is one of three being sold by Kerry Taylor Auctions on December 9.</p>
      <p>They also include a long-sleeved dress from 1986 by Katherine Cusack, also in midnight-blue velvet, and a Catherine Walker navy wool day dress from around 1989.</p>
      <p>The Edelstein dress was part of a collection of outfits that Diana herself sold for charity at auction in June 1997, just weeks before she was killed in a car crash in Paris. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
