      <h1>Man City 'draw level financially with Man Utd' thanks to £650m Puma kit deal</h1>
      <h2>The blue half of Manchester had to live in the shadow of their once-more successful rivals for a long time but are now almost on a par financially</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:27:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:27</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City appear set to match Manchester United from a financial perspective for the first time in decades.</p>
      <p>Until the takeover of the club from the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008 City were nowhere near their bitter rivals both in terms of on-pitch and off-pitch success.</p>
      <p>Since their massive investment, however, City have gone from strength to strength, winning four Premier League titles compared to United's three in that time as well as attracting genuinely world-class talent to the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>And according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699395/Manchester-City-catch-Manchester-United-cash-race-thanks-650m-kit-deal.html">Daily Mail</a> , City are set to match United's annual revenue for 2019-2020, with a total of around £560m expected for both.</p>

      <p>This is partly due to United's revenue falling by £70m thanks to a lack of Champions League football this season, and partly because of City's eye-watering £650m 10-year deal with kit manufacturing giant Puma.</p>
      <p>United's wages are also down by £6.8m year on year, due to them not having to pay Champions League bonuses.</p>
      <p>To put their meteoric rise in perspective, City's revenue in the 2007-2008 season was just £104m, while United's was £257m.</p>
      <p>United executive vice chairman Ed Woodward recently announced his club's first-quarter figures, and admitted there was much to improve on.</p>

      <p>"Our ultimate goal is to win trophies, playing fast, fluid, attacking football with a team that fuses graduates from our academy along with world-class acquisitions," he said.</p>
      <p>"We know this will not be achieved overnight. However we have made investments across the club that we believe have set us on the right path."</p>
      <p>City have again been outshining United on the pitch so far this season, and are currently nine points clear of them in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Premier League champions next face a tough-looking game at home to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> on Saturday, while United travel to Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
