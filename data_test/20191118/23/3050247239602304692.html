      <h1>US Gov’t Extradites Alleged Fraudster for Selling Fake Securities for $11M in BTC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:45:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Kollen Post</a></address>
      <p>The United States has extradited a Swedish national from Thailand for allegedly selling fraudulent securities to investors online, garnering over $11 million worth of Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>).</p>
      <p>Per a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alleged-cryptocurrency-fraudster-extradited-thailand-face-charges-multi-million-dollar">press release</a> from the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) published on Nov. 18, Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson is on his way to the U.S. to stand trial on behalf of himself and his company, Eastern Metal Securities.</p>
      <h3>The indictment</h3>
      <p>According to the DoJ, Karlsson was arrested on June 17. On July 25, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Karlsson on charges of alleged securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Karlsson allegedly used Eastern Metal Securities, as well as an array of false online identities, to funnel investors into paying $98 per share in the company on the promise of an eventual payout of 1.15 kilograms of gold per share — as of press time, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/XAU:CUR">worth</a> nearly $60,000.</p>
      <p>Operating this business remotely, Karlsson took payment from investors using virtual currencies including Bitcoin, on the promise of returning 97% of the value of their initial investment in the event that the gold payout did not pan out. </p>
      <p>The DoJ says that 3,575 people invested a total of over $11 million in Karlsson’s scheme. Per the release, that money is now tied up in Thailand’s real estate market.</p>
      <h3>Other recent prosecutions in crypto</h3>
      <p>Late last week, a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/onecoin-co-founder-pleads-guilty-faces-up-to-90-years-in-jail">founder</a> of massive ponzi scheme OneCoin, which centered around a cryptocurrency that didn’t exist, pleaded guilty to charges including fraud and money laundering. The man, Konstantin Ignatov, faces up to 90 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>New York’s Southern District Court recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-resident-indicted-for-crypto-scam-charged-with-wire-fraud">indicted</a> a man for wire fraud. Asa Saint Clair reportedly used ill-gotten investor funds to finance his other firms as well as some of the high life in Manhattan.</p>
