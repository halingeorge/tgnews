      <p>Now <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> thinks we could be just hours away from Ian Wright losing his cool.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old said after the opening show that "he might blow, he might just go" as soon as Ian gets hungry.</p>
      <p>Now after chatting on Extra Camp, Dec thinks we're already nearing the former footballer's breaking point.</p>
      <p>"I feel sorry for him as we're all waiting for it to happen," teased Emily Atack.</p>

      <p>"But I think he might just crack today."</p>
      <p>The co-hosts then broke into a chorus of 'he's gonna snap, he's gonna snap!'</p>
