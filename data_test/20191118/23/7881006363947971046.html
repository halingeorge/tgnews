      <p><b>Bengaluru</b>: The state government has made it compulsory for students of all government, aided, unaided and private schools to read out the Preamble to the Constitution and fundamental duties of every citizen during their morning assembly sessions from November 26.</p>
      <p>Commissioner of Public Instruction Dr K.G. Jagadeesh issued a circular to the headmasters of all schools asking them to implement the order and observe Nov. 26 as the Constitution Day.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The directive came from Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, Union Ministry of Human Resource Development and Department of School Education and Literacy.</p>
      <p>Mr Rajesh Kumar Maurya, an undersecretary at the Union government, sent letters to all state project directors directing them to spread awareness on the Preamble from this year to coincide with the Constitution Day celebrations on Nov. 26.</p>
      <p>The Preamble, which was adopted on Nov. 26, 1949, is also referred to as the preface to the Constitution that reads in one long sentence explaining to people about the essence of the Constitution. It is also a brief introductory statement that sets out guidelines and principles of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>Mr Jagadeesh directed DDPIs and headmasters to display the preamble and fundamental duties on notice boards of their schools.</p>
      <p>The DPI directed schools to conduct essay, debate and quiz competitions and to hold cultural programmes around the theme of the Constitution. Schools have been told to hold pledge-taking ceremonies, mock Parliament sessions related to the Constitution and also upload photos and videos of the Constitution Day events and mail them to schools.gov@gmail.com.   </p>
