      <h3>The University of Saskatchewan will work with the Métis Nation of Saskatchewan (MN-S) to keep making the school more welcoming to Indigenous students.</h3>
      <p>U of S President Peter Stoicheff and MN-S President Glen McCallum signed a memorandum of understanding Monday at a ceremony on the university campus.</p>
      <p>Stoicheff said the MOU underscores the school’s commitment to improving “university education access, relevance and achievement of Métis people and their communities within the university.”</p>
      <p>The agreement is meant to encourage Métis presence in the student body and among staff and faculty. The memorandum also encourages Métis-specific programming and research.</p>

      <p>McCallum cited prominent Métis connections with the U of S while praising Monday’s agreement. He pointed to James McKay, a lawyer and member of the school’s first Board of Governors, and Howard Adams, a Métis leader who also taught in the university’s department of Native Studies.</p>
      <p>“With continued community partnering, such as today’s announcement with the University of Saskatchewan, Métis youth can confidently follow the examples set by individuals like James McKay, Howard Adams and other Métis leaders, thinkers and achievers.”</p>
      <p>The U of S noted in a press release that its enrolment includes 3,320 Indigenous students for 2018-19. The school reported having 217 self-identified Indigenous employees on campus in 2019.</p>
