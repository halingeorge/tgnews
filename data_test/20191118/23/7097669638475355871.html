      <h1>State Department Staffer Who Overheard Phone Call Between Trump and Sondland Will Testify Publicly This Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:32:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/" target="_blank">Mairead McArdle</a></address>
      <p>State Department official David Holmes, who allegedly overheard a conversation between President Trump and U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland in which Trump asked about a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens, will testify in a public impeachment hearing Thursday.</p>
      <p>William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, testified Wednesday during the first public impeachment hearing that Holmes heard Trump press Sondland about investigations during a July 26 phone call, the day after Trump’s ill-fated phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky that sparked the impeachment inquiry against him. Trump asked Sondland whether Ukraine would investigate Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden’s connections to a Ukrainian gas company as well as alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Taylor added that after the phone call, Sondland remarked to Holmes that Trump cared more about whether Ukraine would investigate Biden than about the broader U.S. policy toward Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“So, he’s gonna do the investigation?” Holmes will testify that Trump asked Sondland, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/470982-house-democrats-announce-public-testimony-of-staffer-who-testified">according</a> to a prepared opening statement.</p>
      <p>“He’s gonna do it,” Sondland responded.</p>
      <p>The White House has denied accusations of a quid pro quo relating to the Trump administration’s delay of much-needed U.S. military aid to Ukraine over the same period the administration was pressuring Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into the Bidens.</p>
      <p>Holmes’s appearance comes as a number of other impeachment witnesses are slated to testify this week, including Sondland himself and Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine who testified in a closed-door congressional hearing about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s involvement in the push for investigations.</p>
