      <h1>U.S. Real Estate Investment Trusts Topped Market Gains Last Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:46:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author">James Picerno</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>US real estate investment trusts rallied last week, posting the strongest gain for the major asset classes.</li>
        <li>Vanguard Real Estate jumped 1.7% last week. The gain was by far the strongest increase for the major asset classes.</li>
        <li>Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets tumbled 1.3% last week.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>US real estate investment trusts (REITs) rallied last week, posting the strongest gain for the <a href="https://www.capitalspectator.com/major-asset-classes-october-2019-performance-review/">major asset classes,</a> based on a set of exchange-traded funds. US REITs also continue to lead global markets with the highest one-year return as well.</p>
      <p>Vanguard Real Estate (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ">VNQ</a>) jumped 1.7% last week (through Nov. 15). The gain was by far the strongest increase for the major asset classes. VNQ had been sliding previously, after reaching a record high in late-October. The rebound that unfolded in last week's trading has real estate's bulls wondering anew if the ETF is laying the groundwork to reach a new record high in the weeks ahead.</p>

      <p>Last week's biggest loser: emerging markets stocks. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWO">VWO</a>) tumbled 1.3%. In a round of profit-taking, the crowd pulled back in what had been a high-flying ETF of late. Indeed, VWO's decline marks the fund's first weekly setback in nearly two months.</p>
      <p>The overall trend in global markets, however, remained positive last week. An ETF-based version of the Global Market Index (GMI.F) - an unmanaged benchmark that holds all the major asset classes (except cash) in market-value weights - rose 0.6%. The rise marks the sixth straight weekly advance for the index.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, US REITs continue to lead the major asset classes for the one-year trend (252 trading days). VNQ closed last week with 19.4% total return vs. the year-earlier level. US stocks are a close second with a 17.0% total return via Vanguard Total Stock Market (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTI">VTI</a>).</p>
      <p>Commodities (broadly defined) are still the only negative print for the major asset classes on a trailing one-year basis. The iShares S&amp;P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSG">GSG</a>) is down 3.0% over the past year.</p>
      <p>By contrast, GMI.F continues to post a strong 13.6% total return for the trailing one-year window.</p>

      <p>Reviewing all the ETFs listed above through a momentum lens continues to reflect a strong upside bias overall. The analysis is based on two sets of moving averages. The first compares the 10-day moving average with its 100-day counterpart - a proxy for short-term trending behavior (red line in chart below). A second set of moving averages (50 and 200 days) represents the intermediate measure of the trend (blue line). At last week's close, markets remained in a strong bullish posture in nearly every corner of the major asset classes.</p>
