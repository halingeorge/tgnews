          <b><a href="https://www.insider.com/wegmans-to-add-meal-delivery-half-its-stores-2019-4">Wegmans</a>, a family-owned grocery store chain on the East Coast, recently opened its first location in Brooklyn, New York.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>As an LA native, I’d never heard of Wegmans before, so I was excited to see what all the hype was about.</b>

        <li>
          <b>I went to a <a href="https://www.insider.com/s?q=whole+foods">Whole Foods</a> and Wegmans location in Brooklyn to see which store had a better overall shopping experience, taking each store’s layout, variety of foods, and prices into account.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Whole Foods had a decent selection of affordable items for the health-concious shopper, but the large open space and high-quality prepared food items at Wegmans ultimately gave it the edge.</b>

      <h3>First, I visited the new Wegmans located at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York, which opened on October 27.</h3>

      <h3>At Wegmans, my first impression was that I loved how the store had a large and bright outdoor dining space.</h3>

      <h3>Whole Foods’ dining area was a bit smaller, and packed with people. And unlike Wegmans, it didn’t have an outdoor section.</h3>

      <h3>Wegmans had so many prepared options, it was hard to choose. There was even a chicken-wing bar, which I thought was unique.</h3>

      <h3>The hot-food bar at Whole Foods offered items like mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, but had less of a variety of cuisines.</h3>

      <h3>One of the Whole Foods employees told me that the hot-food bar rotates weekly with various cuisines like Italian or Mexican. The week I visited, it was classic Indian, which included chicken tikka masala.</h3>

      <h3>As I continued to walk through Wegmans, I was blown away by the little things that seemed to have been taken into consideration — like the endless amount of single entrée food options.</h3>

      <h3>In my opinion, they were decently priced. For example, a ready-to-cook meal like coconut shrimp with sweet chili sauce cost $6.50.</h3>
      <figure>

      <h3>I also appreciated Wegmans’ wide assortment of bagels and cream cheese, which were conveniently placed next to each other.</h3>

      <h3>Wegmans had little touches throughout that added personality to the store, like a train track that circled above the dairy section.</h3>

      <h3>I tried a sample of the lobster mac and cheese at the seafood station, and found it had a gourmet taste. I was surprised to learn that it only took 15 minutes in the oven to prepare at home.</h3>

      <h3>Whole Foods also offered a single-serve entrée of mac and cheese, which was a lot cheaper at $5.99 — compared to the one at Wegmans which was $13 — but didn’t come with lobster.</h3>

      <h3>For example, being able to sample the cheese at Whole Foods would have been helpful in making a selection.</h3>

      <h3>Wegmans’ cheese selection was one of my favorite things about the store, with cheese imported from around the world. In addition to offering samples, one employee told me Wegmans also make its own cheese.</h3>

      <h3>While Wegmans dedicated a whole section of its store to cheese, the cheese collection at Whole Foods included a small selection of various types. Though, to be fair, other Whole Foods stores have larger selections than this one did.</h3>

      <h3>One convenient thing about Wegmans was that it had a self-checkout option available, which I appreciated since sometimes I shop in a hurry and only need one thing.</h3>

      <h3>Another thing I liked about Wegmans was its selection of healthy — and unhealthy — food items that included larger-name brands.</h3>
      <figure>

      <h3>In comparison, Whole Foods sold healthier alternatives to some of the big-name chip brands. Although this was a Whole Foods 365 store, its collection still mainly included options for health-conscious shoppers.</h3>

      <h3>Another personal touch at Wegmans was its coffee shop, The Buzz.</h3>

      <h3>Another major difference between the two was that Wegmans had a large selection of beer, allowing customers to craft their own six-pack.</h3>
