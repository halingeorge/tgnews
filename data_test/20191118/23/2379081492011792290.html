Interest on the notes will be 4.000%, and will be payable in cash semi-annually, beginning on May 15, 2020. The notes constitute a further issuance of, are fully fungible with, rank equally with and form a single series with the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.000% senior notes due 2029 issued on November 7, 2019. The Offering is expected to settle on November 20, 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.
