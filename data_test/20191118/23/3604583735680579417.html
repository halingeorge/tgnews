      <h1>Industrial strife brewing at TAFE in fight over teacher hours</h1>

      <p>Thousands of Victorian TAFE teachers are on the brink of going to war with their employers, the state's TAFE institutes, over a push to increase their teaching load without a pay increase.</p>
      <p>Several of the state's TAFE institutes have collectively applied to Fair Work to tear up their workplace agreements with teaching staff and compel teachers to spend more hours doing face-to-face teaching work.</p>
      <p>The Australian Education Union has accused the Andrews government of siding with the institutes and undermining TAFE teachers, despite pledging to "save TAFE", in a rare spat between the government and the Labor-aligned union.</p>
      <p>Under the current four-year workplace agreement, signed in October last year, the amount of time a TAFE teacher spends in the classroom is capped at 800 hours a year, while time spent on class planning and assessment is capped at 400 hours.</p>
      <p>But the institutes want to block teachers from doing assessment hours in class-time, despite agreeing to this clause just over a year ago.</p>
      <p>Teachers argue the change will open the door for the institutes to compel them to take on extra classes, intensifying their workload.</p>
      <p>Federation University, Victoria University and RMIT have not joined the other institutes in seeking to rewrite the workplace agreement.</p>
