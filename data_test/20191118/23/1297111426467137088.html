      <h1>Maintenance issues at Regina General Hospital raise safety concerns</h1>
      <h2>Staff expressed concerns about infection and fall risks due to maintenance issues that went months without being fixed, according to documents obtained by the Saskatchewan NDP.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:42:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>Regina General Hospital is ailing from numerous untreated maintenance issues, including some that staff believe could spread infection or put patients at risk of falls.</p>
      <p>That’s according to a list of unfilled maintenance orders obtained by the Saskatchewan NDP through a freedom of information request. Some of the orders were filed months ago and still hadn’t been resolved by Oct. 3, the date the document was printed.</p>
      <p>In March, staff reported that the Infectious Diseases Clinic was “in terrible disrepair.” According to the maintenance order, the linoleum floor was being held down with silver duct tape at every entry, with long strips through entire rooms.</p>
      <p>Staff also reported that a “service aid room” in the hospital’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit suffered from a “possible infection control issue.” In a February work order, staff wrote that the counters there were in need of resurfacing and the walls in need of patching. But the order was still open as of last month.</p>
      <p>Vicki Mowat, the NDP’s health critic, zeroed in on those two issues in question period on Monday. She cast them as symptoms of a wider problem at Regina General Hospital and across the health system.</p>
      <p>“There is a very long, very concerning list of issues in the General which have not been addressed,” she said. “Multiple reports of faulty oxygen outlets, dripping ceilings and fall risks.”</p>
      <p>Mowat pointed to a facility audit that pegged the infrastructure deficit across the Saskatchewan Health Authority in the billions. She accused the government of touting “shiny new buildings” like the Jim Pattison Children’s Hospital while presiding over “crumbling health facilities” elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Jim Reiter later told reporters that spending on maintenance is up $10 million to $55 million in the last budget. But he promised to look into the issues that Mowat warned about.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got much work to do but health care is a priority for this government,” he said. “It’ll continue to be a priority for this government.”</p>
      <p>Reiter said the Saskatchewan Party has boosted overall health spending by 60 per cent. He blamed the NDP for failing to invest in healthcare infrastructure during its time in government.</p>
      <p>“This didn’t happen overnight. This happened also when the NDP were in government,” he said. “We have spent hundreds of millions on maintenance and repair, and on building new capital projects.”</p>
      <p>NDP Leader Ryan Meili said he’s getting tired of hearing government ministers looking 12 years into the past.</p>
      <p>“They don’t like to talk very much about the last three or four years, because they don’t want to talk about their actual record,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meili, who previously worked as a family doctor, said he suspects some of the issues on the work orders could present a safety or infection risks for patients, notably the duct tape and the neonatal unit issues. He called it “irresponsible” to leave them unresolved.</p>
      <p>“You get in the hospital to get better, and you don’t want to be exposed to more potential illness,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Clearly, those are things you wouldn’t be waiting months and months to respond to. Those are things you get fixed right away.”</p>
      <p>Other concerns on the work orders included a musty or mouldy smell that was identified as a “recurring issue,” walls and floors “damaged extensively” by water that raised fears of black mould, a change room with a carpet plagued by “extreme uncleanliness” and flooring in a mental health unit that was called a fall safety risk.</p>
      <p>Leaky oxygen regulators or air valves were among the most common problems listed on the document. There was also a report of a leaking ceiling in a patient room in the mental health unit, though that was filed the day before the document was printed.</p>
