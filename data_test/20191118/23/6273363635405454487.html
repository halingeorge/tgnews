      <p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/05/an-apple-valve-ar-headset-deal-makes-sense-given-ios-13s-starboard/">Valve</a> has announced that it will reveal Half-Life: Alyx this Thursday on November 21 at 10 a.m. Pacific.</p>

      <p>This is Valve’s flagship VR title. The company has been a big proponent of the technology, working on the VR collection of minigames The Lab and its own high-end headset, the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/28/valve-index-review-when-only-the-best-will-do/">Valve Index</a>.</p>
      <p>This will also be the first new title in the Half-Life series since the launch of Half-Life 2: Episode II back in 2007. That title ended with a cliffhanger, so we could finally get some resolution.</p>
      <p>Alyx Vance was an important character in Half-Life 2 and its episodes, serving as the next most important character after hero Gordon Freeman. And unlike Gordon, Alyx is not a silent protagonist.</p>
      <p>We don’t know what kind of game this will be, but every other title in the franchise has been a first-person shooter. We also don’t know if Half-Life: Alyx will be playable outside of VR.</p>
