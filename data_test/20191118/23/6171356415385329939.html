      <h1>New 'My Devices' Google account page shows computers, too</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:25:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>You might have used the <a href="https://www.google.com/android/find">Find my Device</a> feature in Google accounts before, which displays a list of your Android phones and tables with the ability to ring or wipe them remotely. There is also a little-known <a href="https://google.com/apps/mydevices">My Devices page</a>, mostly used within G Suite organizations, which works with all mobile devices logged into your Google account. Starting today, the latter page is getting a much-needed facelift.</p>
      <p>The new design, pictured above, now includes both mobile and desktop devices. The old layout, pictured below, only displayed phones and tablets. The new page otherwise functions identically, but looks <i>much</i> nicer. When you're panicking because you left your work phone on the train, and you need to locate it as quickly as possible, it's important that the page looks nice.</p>

      <p>The panel also has a new URL, as it's now located at <a href="http://mydevices.google.com/">mydevices.google.com</a>, rather than <a href="https://google.com/apps/mydevices">google.com/apps/mydevices</a>. Google says the new page will take 1-3 days to appear for everyone.</p>
