      <h4>1. Apple iPad (6th Gen) 128GB Wi-Fi</h4>

      <p>Walmart</p>
      <p>Best Buy and Target are also selling this 2018 model, 6th generation iPad, but you’ll get the best Black Friday price at Walmart. It may not be the newest iPad, but it’s still <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-apple-ipads">the best one you can buy</a> because it has nearly all the same features as the more expensive iPad Air – just an older processor. The 6th-gen iPad features a sharp screen, high-end metal design, Apple Pencil support, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a generous 128 GB storage.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>2. Apple AirPods with Charging Case</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>AirPods don’t go on sale often, so when they do, you should take advantage of the opportunity. On Amazon, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2q3zRYp">new AirPods Pro are $15 off</a> (now $235), but if you’re not looking to spend more than $200 and you prefer to shop on Walmart, the original AirPods are still a powerful and convenient alternative.</p>

      <h4>3. Powerbeats3 Wireless Earphones</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>The Powerbeats3 are one of the most popular models from Beats. Its comfortable earhooks make them optimal for workouts, they have a 12-hour battery life, and when they’re close to your Apple device, they’ll automatically pair. This particular set on sale is cool because it comes in four bright and eye-catching color options, instantly differentiating them from other earphones.</p>

      <h4>4. KitchenAid Classic Plus 4.5 Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>There’s a reason why a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-kitchenaid">KitchenAid stand mixer</a> is considered a countertop staple. The 4.5-quart bowl is up for any mixing challenge, featuring 10 different speeds to help you mix, knead, and whip up ingredients. If you’re a beginner baker on a budget, we recommend this mixer because it’s versatile, dependable, and quiet. Compared to other stand mixer models, it has the least powerful motor.</p>

      <h4>5. Shark Ion Robot Vacuum Cleaning System</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Save time and energy on cleaning tasks by getting a robot vacuum. The S86 is one of Shark’s older vacuums, which might explain why it’s enjoying such a large discount. Still, it’s efficient and smart. It’s able to navigate around your home thanks to sensitive sensors, and you can schedule cleaning sessions from anywhere with the Robot app. If you have a pet that always sheds hair, this vacuum with powerful suction and an extra-large dust bin is your best bet for cleaning up after it.</p>

      <h4>6. Google Smart TV Kit</h4>

      <p>You probably can’t go a day without using Google at least once. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-dot-vs-google-home-mini?utm=newsbreak">Google Home Mini</a> captures the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-google-home-speaker">capabilities of Google Assistant</a> and the Google search engine in a tiny device and can accomplish a huge number of tasks, from giving you a preview of your week’s schedule to controlling your smart home devices. This Walmart Exclusive pairs it with a TV streamer that lets you stream entertainment right from your phone.</p>

      <h4>7. Google Smart Light Starter Kit</h4>

      <p>If you already have a TV streaming device that you love, another Google Home bundle you might like is the starter kit to a smart lighting setup. The GE bulb screws on like a regular light bulb, but is much cooler than your average light bulb. You can dim the lights, turn them on and off, and create routines so you never have to get up to hit the light switch again.</p>

      <h4>8. Farberware 3.2 Quart Digital Air Fryer</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>People who own air fryers love the appliances for letting them “fry” their favorite foods without oil. Most models cost at least $50, but you can get this Farberware digital air fryer for an affordable price this Black Friday, lowering the barriers of entry to healthier and faster cooking.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>9. HP 14 Laptop</h4>

      <p>Start the new year with a new laptop that doesn’t cost a fortune. This HP laptop offers a fast experience and long battery life (plus it can charge from 0% to 50% in just 45 minutes). It’s thin and fairly light at 3.24 pounds, so it won’t weigh you down as you trek around campus or the city.</p>
