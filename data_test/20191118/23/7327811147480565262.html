      <p>MIDDLE ISLAND, Long Island (WABC) -- A clerk at a Long Island bagel shop drove seven hours to return a customer's missing car key fob.</p>
      <p>"He said, 'I'll drive them to you,'" Ridge resident Diana Chong said about Bagels 101 store manager Vincent Proscia. "No hesitation at all."</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, Chong quickly popped into the Middle Island bagel shop for coffee before getting on the road to Pennsylvania for a Friendsgiving. Her husband was driving their 2016 Kia Sedona, so she just hopped out of the car to go inside.</p>
      <p>"I took my keys because I use the Bally Rewards," she said. "I come here every morning on my way to work. And then after that, I got my bagels. I went back in the car and we drove away."</p>
      <p>They drove all the way from Middle Island to Honesdale -- 180 miles away -- and that's when she realized she'd left her keys behind.</p>
      <p>"I'm just happy we made to our destination," Chong said. "Because if we would have stopped to let out the dog and shut off the car, we would have been stranded."</p>
      <p>Proscia said Chong called the shop to let them know that she had left her keys there.</p>
      <p>"I said I'll overnight them," Proscia said. "She called back and said that (I) can't overnight them and was like, 'I can't go to work on Monday.' I said I'll be right there. Send me the address, I'll come drop them off."</p>
      <p>Overnighting the keys was not an option because there was no Sunday delivery, so the store manager took a road trip he would never forget, nor regret.</p>
      <p>"It's just the right thing to do," Proscia said. "If it happened to my wife, I would want someone else to do it for her."</p>
      <p>Chong was extremely thankful for his generosity and taking customer service to another level.</p>
      <p>"It's the fact that he only knows me from coming in every morning," she said. "And he just, without hesitation came all the way. Drove three-and-a-half hours there, three-and-a-half hours back, got two hours sleep to go to work the next day. I can't ask for anything more."</p>
