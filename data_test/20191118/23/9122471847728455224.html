      <h1>Oklahoma Issues Update On Wide Receiver CeeDee Lamb</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:40:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The Sooners were without one of their top offensive weapons against Baylor on Saturday. Receiver CeeDee Lamb was a late scratch after initially getting dressed and going through warm-ups with his teammates.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Lincoln Riley and the Sooners, they were able to survive Baylor’s valiant effort, spoiling the Bears’ undefeated season in a 34-31 nail-biter. But it was clear last Saturday that the offense is different without Lamb on the field.</p>
      <p>Will the star receiver to return to action this Saturday against TCU? Oklahoma’s head coach discussed Lamb’s status with the media on Monday.</p>
      <blockquote>“CeeDee’s still going to be up in the air,” Riley said, via <a href="https://247sports.com/college/oklahoma/Article/CeeDee-Lamb-injury-play-Grant-Calcaterra-Oklahoma-Sooners-138831017/">247Sports</a>. “We haven’t seen our guys yet this week with Sunday being our off day. It’s not a definite no, but certainly not a definite yes right now.”</blockquote>
      <p>Looks like this one may come down to the wire later this week. It’s still unclear as to what Lamb is dealing with.</p>
      <p>Jalen Hurts and this Sooners offense hopes to have their most dangerous offensive weapon back on the field against TCU. Oklahoma is still in contention for a College Football Playoff selection. But the Sooners will need some help and must win-out.</p>
      <p>We’ll get a much clearer picture regarding Lamb’s availability later this week.</p>
