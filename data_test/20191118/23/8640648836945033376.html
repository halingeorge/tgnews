      <p>The Fremont Street Experience is planning to add an LED sign that pays tribute to downtown’s rich history.</p>
      <p>The sign is set to be built on the east side of Main and Fremont streets. The new addition is part of the Fremont Street Experience’s canopy project, a “floor-to-ceiling” renovation on the Fremont Street Experience that includes a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/fremont-street-experience-readies-light-canopy-for-new-years-eve-1890781/">$32 million</a> upgrade to its Viva Vision screen.</p>
      <p>The display, approximately 27 feet by 14 feet, will offer visitors views of downtown throughout the decades. It could show a still of Fremont Street as a dirt road one moment, then flip to an image of a bustling hangout during the mob era the next. The sign will not be used for any advertisements.</p>
      <p>“You’re looking at a porthole in time,” said Patrick Hughes, president and CEO of the Fremont Street Experience. “It’s a fully immersive experience.”</p>
      <p>The sign is based on split-flap display boards, a type of mechanical signs often used in railroad stations. Creators chose the animation style as a nod to the Plaza’s history; a train depot once stood on the site where the hotel-casino stands today.</p>
      <p>Those historical nods are what a lot of downtown visitors are looking for, according to Hughes. He pointed to examples such as the Mob Museum and the Fremont Street Experience, which displays a handful of “old Vegas” neon signs.</p>
      <p>“There’s a massive interest in history and connectivity” among visitors, Hughes said.</p>
      <p>The Commission for the Las Vegas Centennial has agreed to provide $225,000 in funding for the project, which costs about $450,000 total and had Steelman Partners acting as the architect. The Las Vegas City Council is set to vote on the funding allocation Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Hughes said he expects construction of the sign, to start the week of Nov. 18, with the sign up and running around Dec. 20.</p>
