      <h1>UES family seeks nanny who can be kids’ personal papparazzi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:06:25+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:06</time> by <a rel="author">Kirsten Fleming</a></address>
      <p>Wanted: the perfect mix of Mario Testino and Mary Poppins.</p>
      <p>An Upper East Side family is seeking a seasoned creative who can serve as their personal paparazzi as well as a part-time nanny, according to <a href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tfr/d/new-york-social-media-photographer/7006452188.html">a Craigslist ad that’s now going viral</a>.</p>
      <p>The post from last month <a href="https://twitter.com/dorseyshaw/status/1195767971618205696?s=20">made the rounds on social media recently</a>, sparking a fresh round of ridicule — and prayers for the person taking the hybrid role.</p>
      <p>The short “help wanted” post read like a lost episode of Bravo’s now-cancelled comedy, “Odd Mom Out,” which parodied the lives of Manhattan’s wealthy entitled class. The parent responsible for the ad didn’t return The Post’s requests for comment.</p>
      <p>For this role, which is essentially three jobs in one, the perfect candidate will have the photography and editing skills to help craft the uptown family’s social media brand while helping to manage the precious children in their off time.</p>
      <p>“This person MUST have advanced knowledge of Photoshop and Lightroom, have experience working with/shooting young children/families and be comfortable acting as Mother’s Helper on days when not shooting/editing,” the ad requested. No word on what the pay would be.</p>
      <p>It’s a sad commentary on both the state of parenting — which sells social media likes as an integral part of the modern familial belief system — and the current value placed on a creative’s time, worth and skill-set.</p>
      <p>But then again, maybe there are some struggling shutterbugs with a deep knowledge of fashion photography and Instagram expertise looking to round out their Romper Room know-how.</p>
      <p>The job will be compensated with an hourly or a daily rate. But, the ad stressed, “please do not apply if you do not have the required photo editing experience. Thank you.”</p>
