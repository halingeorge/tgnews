        <b>Half-Life: Alyx is real. After numerous rumours, Valve confirmed that its “flagship VR game” is a new take on the Half-Life universe, and will unveil further details Thursday, November 21 at 10:00 PST / 13:00 EST / 19:00 BST – not at the Game Awards, as the rumours initially suggested.</b>

      <p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584">Twitter</a> announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of a transcript that appeared on <a href="https://pastebin.com/9rjrw8nC">Pastebin</a>, which allegedly quotes an interview between Robin Walker (who had a development role in Half-Life 2, and co-developed Team Fortress 2), videogame journalist Geoff Keighley (whose Final Hours documentary series has looked at the development of Half-Life 2), and a third, unnamed participant. In it, Keighley is quoted as saying, “March 2020, ‘Half-Life: Alyx’ comin’ out.”</p>
      <p>Asked about whether the game would be VR-only or available to those who haven’t got a headset, the unknown person says, “I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard, but like, as we said, it began as an exploration of VR.”</p>
      <p>Details on the game are sparse, but there is one indication of what gameplay could involve: “You can see their whole body – respond to the situation. You know, panicking, dropping clips on the ground as they fumble their weapons ’cause a zombie’s in front of them,” someone says, suggesting that they’ve seen some playtests of this.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear where the leaked interview has come from, but it apparently comes from the same source behind a Dota Underlords leak. A new transcript of the content (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rumour-valve-are-about-to-announce-a-vr-game-called-half-life-alyx/">PC Gamer</a>) indicates that Half-Life: Alyx will be at The Game Awards, which take place December 12, though it looks like we’re getting a reveal sooner than that.</p>
