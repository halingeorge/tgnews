      <h1>Starlight Capital Announces Distribution Reinvestment Plan for ETFs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:00:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Business Wire</a></address>
      <p>TORONTO — Starlight Investments Capital LP (“Starlight Capital”), on behalf of Starlight Global Real Estate Fund (NEO: SCGR) and Starlight Global Infrastructure Fund (NEO: SCGI) (collectively, the “Funds”), is pleased to announce that it has implemented a distribution reinvestment plan (the “Plan”) for eligible holders (“Unitholders”) of exchange-traded series of units (“ETF Units”), effective November 12, 2019.</p>
      <p>The Plan intends to provide Unitholders an opportunity to acquire additional ETF Units at the average price paid (excluding brokerage commissions, fees and all transaction costs) per ETF Unit during the five business days following the distribution payment date for all the ETF Units purchased by the plan agent. The Plan provides an efficient and cost-effective way for the Funds to provide existing Unitholders with additional equity. Only future dividends declared by the Funds will be eligible for reinvestment of the Plan.</p>
      <p>A Unitholder may terminate or modify their participation in the Plan at any time. Interested Unitholders should contact their brokers and consult the full text of the Plan. A copy of the Plan is available on <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sedar.com&amp;esheet=52131531&amp;newsitemid=20191118005921&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sedar.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=e9ee34cd7b3a3d729ca2755f6259fa4e">www.sedar.com</a> or can be requested from our Advisor and Investor Experience Department (contact details below).</p>
