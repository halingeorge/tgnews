      <h2>Scientists studied 60 traditional broth recipes</h2>

      <p>Chicken soup has long been claimed to cure all ills, but now scientists believe soups in general could also be a powerful shield against malaria, a new study has found.</p>
      <p>More than 60 homemade broths brought in by an ethnically diverse group of kids from a London primary school were found to interrupt the life cycle of the most deadly of the malarial parasites.</p>
      <p>The soups, ranging from vegetable to beef and chicken, suggests that there may be other natural resources worth tapping to fight malaria - which poses a risk to roughly half the world’s population.</p>
      <p>Following the development of the antimalarial artemesin, which has been used in Chinese herbal medicine to treat fevers, the researchers sought to discover whether other ‘natural’ remedies might have antimalarial properties.</p>
      <p>They asked the pupils at one London primary school to bring in samples of homemade soup broths, the recipes for which had been passed down through the generations for the treatment of fever.</p>
      <p>The children came from diverse ethnic backgrounds - from across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>Of the 60 clear broths brought in - some of which were too dense to be filtered, with others containing too much oil - 56 were available for testing.</p>
      <p>Several different parasites from the Plasmodium family of bacteria are responsible for causing malaria when transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito - but Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest.</p>
      <p>Filtered extracts of each of the 56 broths were incubated for 72 hours with different cultures of P falciparum, to see if any of the soups might be able to stop the growth of sexually immature parasites that cause disease, as well as blocking sexual maturation - the stage at which the parasite can infect the mosquito.</p>
      <p>Five of the broths were able to curb the growth of the sexually immature parasite by more than 50 per cent - two of which were as effective as dihydroartemisinin, a leading antimalarial drug.</p>
      <p>Four other broths were more than 50 per cent effective at blocking sexual maturation, potentially stopping the transmission of malaria.</p>
      <p>The recipes varied for each of the soups - which were vegetarian, chicken or beef-based - with no particular ingredient in common.</p>
      <p>Study author Professor Jake Baum, from Imperial College London, said: “The utility of any broth found to have antimalarial activity will, of course, depend significantly on standardisation of soup preparation and ultimately identification of the active source ingredient, its fractionation and, towards its progression, detailed toxicology with first human cells and later preclinical trials.”</p>
      <p>“This journey, mirroring that of artemisinin from the Qinghao herb, may as yet reveal another source of potent anti-infective treatment.”</p>
      <p>The paper, which was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation among others, appears today in the Archives of Disease in Childhood - one of more than 70 specialist titles published by the British Medical Journal.</p>
