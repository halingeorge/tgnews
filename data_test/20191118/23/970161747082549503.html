      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! fans were baffled on Monday night as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele-roberts/">Adele Roberts</a> chose a framed photograph of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/loose-women/">Loose Women</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jane-mcdonald/">Jane McDonald</a> as her luxury item to bring into the camp.</p>
      <p>During an extra task in the show, the team at Base Camp were given the opportunity to win meaningful luxury items for each of their fellow contestants by passing them along a row on paddles above a swamp. If the item fell in, the chance of winning the prize sank along with it.</p>
      <p>With most of the contestants opting for practical necessities, like James Haskell’s orthopedic pillow, or sweet mementos from home, like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a>’s picture of his family, the only items to sadly make it through were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a>’s concealer and Adele’s prize.</p>
      <p>‘Just to let you know what we’re playing for,’ the Radio 1 DJ warned her campmates with faux seriousness, ‘mine is a picture of somebody really special to me.’</p>

      <p>Finding out that the chosen picture was of Loose Women star and gay icon Jane McDonald, the campmates (Roman Kemp in particular) looked pretty flabbergasted by the choice.</p>
      <p>‘She’s my favourite Loose Woman, she’s going to get me through the jungle, I love her,’ Adele insisted.</p>

      <p>But while the picture seemed funny when it was one of many items going back to the camp, things went a bit downhill afterwards as no other item managed to make it through.</p>
      <p>Trying to gee up her somewhat deflated campmates when the items arrived, the radio personality hung the picture up in pride of place.</p>
      <p>‘She is a national treasure, she is the queen of Wakefield,’ Adele told her pals. ‘Just think, whenever you’re going off to a trial, just give her a lucky rub and off you go.’</p>
      <p>Um, sure Adele.</p>
      <p>Watching at home, I’m A Celeb viewers seemed to firmly split into two camps themselves: those who found the pic of Jane hilarious and those who had literally no idea what was going on.</p>
      <p>‘Roman Kemp deserved his luxury item over some concealer and a photo of Jane McDonald,’ one fan tweeted, while another agreed: ‘Adele disappoints me with that s***e luxury item, give roman his mug.’</p>

      <p>Bit harsh, but we see the point.</p>
      <p>However, another subsection of Twitter found Adele’s choice hilarious, giving us all the memes we could possibly want from I’m A Celeb.</p>

      <p>‘Your luxury item is a picture of Jane McDonald. Not a loved one, not a friend, Jane McDonald. Amazing,’ one tweeter wrote.</p>
      <p>‘A photo of Jane McDonald should hang in every home around the country,’ another replied, giving us a manifesto we can all live by.</p>
