      <p>With proper guidance, small scale farmers can also practice natural farming and make abundant profits, a message conveyed to farmers during a one-day training programme on turmeric cultivation held at Ganeshan Natural Agro Farm at Keelvani at Anthiyur here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Organised by the Isha Agro Movement (IAM) in association with Tata Trust, leading farmers who have been practising natural farming and conducting training programmes for other farmers took part in the programme. The practical workshop held directly on the farmland also enhances the experience of the participants and enables them with a deeper insight, said the organisers.</p>
      <p>Ganesan, a farmer, said that he have been practising natural farming with various crops such as turmeric, banana and sugarcane for a decade and cultivating turmeric in three acres and inter-cropping with crops such as sweet potato, corn, chilly, brinjal and spinach had earned him good profits. “Practising natural farming has also reaped the benefit of an increased yield to 30 quintal per acre”, he said.</p>
      <p>Another farmer Senthil said that inter-cropping with tree cultivation also provides both environmental and economic benefit apart from ensuring enhanced quality and quantity. He said that though the market price of turmeric is ₹ 7,000 per quintal, he was able to sell it for higher price due to its quality. “Tree inter-cropping also results in an extensive reduction of the quantity of water needed for the crops and also supports in maintaining the soil quality”, he said.</p>
      <p>Farmers were taken to a turmeric farms at two different places for a field visit to gain on-ground exposure following which a question and answer session was held.</p>
