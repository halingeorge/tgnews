      <p>EastEnders fans were disgusted tonight by Ben Mitchell's sickening remark about abuse victims.</p>
      <p>Nasty Ben was finally exposed during a family meal when Kathy Beale discovered her son has been blackmailing Martin Fowler into doing risky jobs.</p>
      <p>Kathy was horrified when she overheard Ben threatening to harm Jean Slater, Big Mo and little Arthur if he didn't get his way.</p>
      <p>But when she confronted a drunken Ben in the kitchen, he turned the tables by slamming his mum for faking her death and "abandoning" her family.</p>
      <p>Vile Ben said: "Everything that happened to you. You asked for it. Martin too. The thing with you weak people, you just love being abused."</p>

      <p>Seething Kathy slapped her son across the face in a furious rage for his sickening comment.</p>
      <p>With tears in her eyes, Kathy added: "I hope to god you never live to be ashamed of your own child."</p>
      <p>Crying Kathy stormed out of the room - while guilt-ridden Ben was left to reflect on his actions.</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , one furious viewer said: "I rarely say this but Ben deserved that &amp; I'm really annoyed at him after saying weak people love being abused you freaking serious right now."</p>
      <p>"I love Ben but he was wrong for saying that's however it's not good to be talking about domestic violence then to end on a cliffhanger with violence," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "OMG Ben , you never learn , It seems you want to be abused , your wounds are too deep"</p>
