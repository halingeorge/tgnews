      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. - <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/99/lsu-tigers">LSU</a> linebacker<a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4035443/michael-divinity-jr"> Michael Divinity</a> returned to practice on Monday, two weeks after leaving the team for what Coach Ed Orgeron described at the time as personal reasons.</p>
      <p>Divinity's status on the team is unclear, however. Orgeron isn't scheduled to address the media until Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Divinity's return comes on the heels of an LSU win over <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/145/ole-miss-rebels">Ole Miss</a> in which the defense gave up some 600 yards of offense, including more than 200 yards and four touchdowns from quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4426494/john-rhys-plumlee">John Rhys Plumlee</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time Divinity left the team, before the <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama</a> game, he had 23 tackles in eight games and led the team with three sacks.</p>
      <p>LSU hosts <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/8/arkansas-razorbacks">Arkansas</a> on Saturday and will close out the regular season in two weeks against <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/245/texas-a&amp;m-aggies">Texas A&amp;M</a>.</p>
