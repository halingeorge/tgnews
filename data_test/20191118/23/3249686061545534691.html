      <p>On the November 18 broadcast of <b>'You Are My Destiny'</b>, <b>Kangnam</b> had a chance to bond with his father-in-law. The conversation was very awkward to the point where Kangnam stated in the interview section show that "it was harder than any variety program" he had ever been in. </p>
      <p>Kangnam then was astounded when his father in law stated: <i>"Have three kids. If you only have one, they'll be lonely." </i>Kangnam then went on to state: <i>"Two daughters and one son sounds great"</i> in which the father-in-law responded jokingly, <i>"Sons are useless. Daughters are great." </i></p>
