      <h1>Man Utd's Daniel James compared to PSG superstar Kylian Mbappe by rival boss</h1>
      <h2>The Welsh winger has had a brilliant start to his Manchester United career and will be hoping to help his side beat Hungary on Tuesday and qualify for Euro 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:58:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:58</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Hungary manager Marco Rossi said Daniel James' speed can be compared to that of Kylian Mbappe ahead of their huge do-or-die game against Wales on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>With Hungary in second place on 12 points and Wales third on 11 in Group E it is effectively a winner-takes-all match when the two go up against each other in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> in their last European Championship qualifying game on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>And Rossi appears to be all too aware of the danger posed by James, who has scored two goals in nine caps for Wales.</p>
      <p>"James is a player that is playing with a motor bicycle because he is really fast," Rossi said.</p>

      <p>"I have never seen someone in the last period as fast as him, maybe Mbappe. He's unbelievable."</p>
      <p>James has been a revelation at United since his Â£15m transfer from Swansea in the summer, adjusting to life in the Premier League immediately by scoring three goals and creating three assists.</p>
      <p>Rossi added: "If we leave him space to run he could be dangerous. This could be the key, but we work a lot on the defensive line and will try to give confidence to our players."</p>
      <p>Hungary know that a draw at the Cardiff City Stadium would see them qualify if Slovakia fail to beat Azerbaijan, but Rossi insisted his team will be going out to win the game, saying he 'could not bet' on a draw.</p>

      <p>"We are trying to get the three points, I would never like to draw and give Slovakia the chance to go through to the Euros," he continued.</p>
      <p>"This is what I would want to avoid. This is not so diplomatic what I am saying, but it is the truth.</p>
      <p>"We will do all our best in order to win, Wales will do the same, and I don't think this match could finish in a draw. I could not bet one pound on the draw.</p>
      <p>"I will ask of my players, if they [Wales] are dragons, to be lions - and then we will see who will win."</p>
