      <p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/person/w/juan-williams.html">Juan Williams</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/justice-jeanine">Judge Jeanine Pirro</a> clashed on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-five">The Five</a>" Monday over President Trump, the House <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> and the media's coverage of the event.</p>
      <p>"I do get the impression that what ... the right is saying is here: 'Oh, please don't watch. Don't pay attention to impeachment,'" Williams said.</p>

      <p>Williams began citing a new <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/70-americans-trumps-actions-tied-ukraine-wrong-poll/story?id=67088534">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a> showing 51 percent of Americans think the president should be impeached, 70 percent feel "request to a foreign leader to investigate his political rival" was wrong and 67 percent of those following the impeachment hearings think he should be impeached.</p>
      <p>"They're trashing [President Trump] every day," Pirro said, reacting to Williams.</p>
      <p>"Oh, stop," Williams said to Pirro.</p>
      <p>"Don't tell me to stop it," Pirro said. "I'm a judge."</p>
      <p>"For a judge, you should know better," Williams responded..</p>
      <p>"Do not go there!" Pirro responded.</p>
      <p>Co-host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/greg-gutfeld-show">Greg Gutfeld</a> laughed as the two continued to argue.</p>
      <p>Co-host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/watters-world">Jesse Watters</a> jumped in and dismissed the poll and blamed the media for the results.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of people out there brainwashed by the mainstream media," Watters said.</p>
      <p>Gutfeld jokingly blamed the economy for skewing the poll arguing that people who would side with Trump were working.</p>

      <p>"We've brought so many Americans back to work," Gutfeld said. "They can't watch this brainwash going on."</p>
      <p>"You can watch it from jail," Williams responded.. "Roger Stone, Paul Manafort. All the best people in jail.  All of Trump's guys."</p>
