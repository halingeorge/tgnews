      <h1>Messi Nets Late To Rescue Argentina</h1>

      <p>Lionel Messi netted a late penalty as Argentina drew 2-2 against Uruguay in an international friendly on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Luis Suarez and Edison Cavani spearheaded La Celeste’s front line, whilst the Albiceleste had Sergio Aguero partnering Messi instead of Lautaro Martinez who dropped to the bench.</p>
      <p>Injury forced the Uruguayans into a substitute 17 minutes after the kick off, as Giovanni Gonzalez filled in for Sebastian Coates.</p>
      <p>Argentina showed loads of promise going forward in hope for the opener, but equally so the Uruguayans threw the gauntlet with Suarez having a shot blocked after 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>Amidst the trying start, La Celeste took the lead in the final ten minutes of the half when Cavani connected brilliantly with Suarez to dink beyond Esteban Andrada.</p>
      <p>Argentina clawed back within two minutes courtesy of an incisive finish from Paulo Dybala, but the attempt was chalked off after the Juventus star utilised his hand in the build-up.</p>
      <p>After quiet start to the second half, the equaliser duly arrived when Aguero headed home from a close-range following a pin-point delivery from partner-in-crime Messi on 63 minutes.</p>
      <p>A turnaround didn’t materialise though as Suarez hauled his side back five minutes later with an astounding free-kick from the edge of the area.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Copa America bronze medal winners refused to die down and after a few openings around the area, threatened to level matters late on but Uruguay defended strongly. Then a penalty arrived seconds later after Martin Caceres was flagged for handling in the area, prompting Messi to fire home and bring the match to a stalemate in Michigan.</p>
