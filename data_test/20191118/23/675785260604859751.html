      <h1>Ant and Dec tell Piers Morgan to 'grow up' as fiery Twitter argument breaks out</h1>
      <h2>Geordie pair Ant and Dec put controversial Piers Morgan in his place as they told him 'grow up you big wally' during heated series of tweets</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:59:47+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p>The nation's favourite telly presenters <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ant-mcpartlin">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">Dec Donnelly</a> told controversial <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/piers-morgan">Piers Morgan</a> to "grow up" during a huge social media argument.</p>
      <p>Ant, 43, and Dec, 44, made a joke about Good Morning Britain's Piers on last night's first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celeb</a> episode of the 2019 series.</p>
      <p>The pair branded Piers, 54, a "snowflake" on their shared Twitter account after a story emerged about the hilarious moment, and it turns out the GMB presenter really wasn't pleased.</p>
      <p>Piers himself then tweeted the Geordie lads back with a sly dig. He said: "At least I have my own Twitter account &amp; don't have to share one with my mate."</p>
      <p>And the boys lashed out with a savage response, saying: "Oh yeah? Well our dads are bigger than your dad. Grow up you big wally!" signed off with a laughing face.</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec humiliated the presenter in front of their joint 6.8million followers for his childish response, and it seems they put him in place as Piers has yet to respond.</p>
      <p>Their feisty argument has enlightened fans on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> who have also shared their comments.</p>

      <p>One fascinated user penned: "Does he really think he can take on two national treasures?!?!"</p>
      <p>While another joked: "This is the twitter war we’ve all been waiting for!!! On behalf of Britain, thank you".</p>
      <p>And a third added: "As if the British public would ever side with Piers Morgan over Ant &amp; Dec... this is brilliant".</p>

      <p>One person even joked there should be a charity boxing match to settle the squabble. They wrote: "Now now boys charity boxing match will sort this <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/boxing?src=hashtag_click">#boxing</a> works".</p>
      <p>It comes after Piers named his price to appear on ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/piers-morgan-names-extortionate-price-20097707">He responded to the Daily Mirror's article</a> calling for him to enter the jungle this year.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "Like I said, £5 million and I'll come and munch kangaroo testicles. Not a penny less."</p>

      <p>But Piers wasn't selected as part of this year's line-up and instead his co-star Kate Garraway stepped foot into the Jungle.</p>
