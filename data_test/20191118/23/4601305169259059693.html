      <h1>Gentleman picks a fight with an American Bison</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:47:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/mark_frauenfelder_1" target="_blank">Mark Frauenfelder</a></address>
      <p>Here we see a man who takes Genesis 9:1-5 seriously: "The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the American Bison he challenged appears not to have read the Bible.</p>
      <p>If there is a God, I hope He pours the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_bowls">Seven Bowls</a> of His wrath on this jackass.</p>
      <p>This happened in 2018, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3HWBdj_Bmk">man, Raymond T. Reinke of Pendleton, Oregon, was arrested</a>. He has a history of being a jerk: allegedly being drunk and disorderly, and intoxication and harassing wildlife. He was <a href="https://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/man-who-harassed-bison-sentenced-to-jail/article_83258942-5839-5ae0-ab6d-4a242b2441cc.html">sentenced to 130 days in jail</a>.</p>
