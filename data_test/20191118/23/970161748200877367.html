      <p>A surgeon is suspected of sexually assaulting 250 people in what could be France’s biggest paedophile scandal.</p>
      <p>Joël Le Scouarnec, 68 is accused of attacking hundreds of children over the course of three decades, sometimes while they were under anaesthetic.</p>
      <p>The specialist in abdominal surgery was arrested in 2017 following claims from a girl, six, who alleged that she had been raped.</p>
      <p>A search of the surgeon’s home in Jonzac in May 2017 led to the discovery of child pornography images.</p>
      <p>Police also found secret diaries in which the surgeon described sex scenes involving scores of other children who were named.</p>
      <p>Today it was announced that 250 potential victims had been identified and that 184 people planned to file a complaint, according to a statement from La Rochelle public prosecutor Laurent Zuchowicz.</p>

      <p>Of the 184, 181 were minors at the time of the alleged assaults, according to <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/chirurgien-pedophile-de-jonzac-250-potentielles-victimes-identifiees-184-plaintes-deja-deposees-18-11-2019-8195484.php">French media</a>.</p>

      <p>Mr Zuchowicz said: ‘250 potential victims of acts of paedophilia that do not fall under the statute of limitations were identified during the (second) investigation.’</p>
      <p>Police were able to question 209, ‘several of whom had very precise memories’ of the alleged abuse, he added.</p>
      <p>The surgeon was convicted of possessing images of child sexual abuse in 2005 but was allowed to continue practising until his arrest in 2017, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>Le Scouarnec’s lawyers said the journal entries were pure ‘fantasies’, but he has admitted to sexually assaulting some child patients in hospitals.</p>
      <p>Francesca Satta, a lawyer for some of the former surgeon’s alleged victims, told AFP: ‘They remember perfectly well what they endured but never talked about it because they were afraid.’</p>
      <p>He will go on trial in March 2020 in Saintes for alleged rape, as well as sexual assault and indecent exposure.</p>
      <p>The medic faces up to 20 years imprisonment if convicted on the first set of charges.</p>
