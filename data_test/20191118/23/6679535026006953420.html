      <p>E-commerce giant Amazon is doing “extremely well” in India, its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has said while expressing hope for regulatory stability in the country.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bezos’ remarks came in response to a question on Amazon’s concerns over some Indian policies with regard to digitisation.</p>
      <p>“Regulatory stability is the thing that we would always hope for India. Whatever the regulations are ... they are stable in time and that’s one of the things we’re hoping will now be true. We’ll see,” Mr. Bezos, 55, told reporters on the sidelines of his induction into the National Portrait Gallery here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He said Amazon was doing very well in India. “Our business in India is doing extremely well. It’s growing very rapidly,” Bezos said.</p>
      <p>He said the head of his India operations, Amit Agarwal, with whom he had worked for 20 years, was an extraordinary leader and was doing really well.</p>
      <p>Amazon is pumping in over ₹4,400 crore (more than $600 million) in its various units in India.</p>
