      <h1>The most amazing medical breakthroughs of 2019</h1>

      <p>Richard Berry had tried nearly everything to fight his prostate cancer: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. But after two years of treatment, his cancer had metastasized. The opportunity to participate in a clinical trial was his last hope.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t ready to die,” Berry, 75, of Keene, NH, tells The Post. “I didn’t want to mess around.”</p>

      <p>In 2015, he connected with Dr. Christopher Sweeney, an oncologist at Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was leading a trial in which the drug enzalutamide — an androgen-receptor inhibitor that stops the growth of cancer cells — was being used in conjunction with testosterone suppression to treat metastasized prostate cancer.</p>
      <p>Berry became one of 1,125 patients involved in the trial. Remarkably, he’s now cancer-free.</p>
      <p>“He’s one of the most dramatic cases to date,” Sweeney tells The Post of Berry’s progress. “He’s in a deep remission. This is what I had hoped to see. However, the magnitude of the effect and the early results were a surprise and delight.”</p>
      <p>So far, Sweeney says, he’s seen a handful of deep remissions like Berry’s and that “the results were positive sooner than we anticipated.” The study was <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1903835">published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>
      <p>The drug, which is already FDA-approved for other uses, is currently under FDA review to make it more widely available for metastasized prostate cancer patients and not just for use in clinical trials.</p>
      <p>Approval is anticipated “any day now,” according to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute reps.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Berry’s scans continue to be clear a year after he stopped the treatment.</p>
      <p>“I don’t even think about [the cancer] anymore,” Berry says. “I feel good. I have energy again, and, overall, I’m just happy.”</p>
      <p>Here, six more amazing medical breakthroughs that could be a reality — and soon.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A blood test for breast cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Researchers at the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191103125418.htm">University of Nottingham in England have created</a> a blood test that could potentially detect breast cancer up to five years before a lump or other symptoms appear. The test, which would be much cheaper and easier to conduct than a mammogram, looks for autoantibodies (produced by the body in reaction to cancer cells) in the blood.</p>
      <p>The researchers said in a statement that another larger study is planned, and, if all goes well, the test could be on the market within the next five years.</p>
      <p>The discovery was presented at the UK’s National Cancer Research Institute’s annual conference in early November, which <a href="https://www.ajmc.com/newsroom/study-shows-potential-efficacy-of-blood-test-for-early-detection-of-breast-cancer">showcases the world’s biggest cancer advances</a>. A similar test for lung cancer is currently being studied in Scotland.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A new cystic fibrosis find</b>
      </p>
      <p>After two clinical trials, a new drug, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-breakthrough-therapy-cystic-fibrosis">Trikafta, a triple combination therapy, was found</a> to cause “significant improvements” in cystic fibrosis patients’ respiratory health and lung function, leading the FDA to fast-track its approval in October.</p>
      <p>The trial’s results were published in the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
      <p>Trikafta is now available to patients 12 and older who have the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, which could affect almost 90% of people with the disease, or about 27,000 people in the US.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A promising Alzheimer’s drug</b>
      </p>
      <p>Early disappointing results halted studies, but after a comprehensive review of the data, researchers are excited once again about an <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/22/there-could-soon-be-a-drug-to-treat-early-alzheimers/">Alzheimer’s drug called aducanumab</a>.</p>
      <p>After 18 months of taking the drug, participants showed lowered cognitive decline (about 15% to 27%) on memory and cognitive ability tests compared to a placebo. The results were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03261-5">published in late October in the journal Nature</a>.</p>
      <p>Due to these results, the drug manufacturer is currently seeking FDA approval for aducanumab to treat Alzheimer’s disease soon after diagnosis.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Crispr for everything</b>
      </p>
      <p>Crispr is a gene-editing tool that allows scientists to modify DNA and genes.</p>
      <p>The technique is being used in numerous ways, from medical research to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/30/crispr-gene-edited-food-technology-us-produce">growing crops</a>. Some of its proposed innovations — destroying superbugs, eradicating malaria and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/12/gene-editing-shows-promise-as-hiv-cure-in-early-tests/">curing HIV</a> — are quite far off.</p>
      <p>Still, the progress is exciting. A patient has been successfully treated for sickle cell disease <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/10/766765780/after-a-life-of-painful-sickle-cell-disease-a-patient-hopes-gene-editing-can-hel">using the technology</a>, and clinical trials using Crispr to treat cancers such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are currently recruiting. Next month, at the American Society of Hematology meeting in Orlando, Fla., scientists will <a href="https://ash.confex.com/ash/2019/webprogram/Paper122374.html">present the results of a three-person cancer study</a> where Crispr was used to treat two people with multiple myeloma and one with sarcoma.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Another sickle cell breakthrough </b>
      </p>
      <p>The first patient in an ongoing clinical trial for sickle cell disease, Manny Johnson, 22, who used to require monthly blood transfusions, has been symptom-free for more than a year after undergoing a clinical trial in Boston. Another sufferer, Jennelle Stephenson, 28, reported showing no signs of sickle cell disease in March after undergoing a yearlong treatment in DC.</p>
      <p>The treatment, which is based on 70 years of research, uses a novel gene therapy treatment — an infusion of the patient’s own reworked bone marrow — to help the body produce normal red blood cells consistently.</p>
      <p>Clinical trials are ongoing around the country. The results of the first adolescent participant, a 16-year-old girl, are expected next month from Dana-Farber.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Peanut allergy promise</b>
      </p>
      <p>A new study <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/11/antibody-injection-stops-peanut-allergy-for-2-to-6-weeks--study-.html">out of Stanford University</a> showed that after one injection of the antibody, etokimab, which is already being studied to treat other immune issues such as asthma and eczema, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/a-glimmer-of-hope-for-people-with-deadly-peanut-allergy-study/">people with severe peanut allergies</a> were able to eat peanut protein — just two weeks later.</p>
      <p>The study was published Nov. 14 online in the journal JCI Insight.</p>
      <p>Currently, the only available treatment for the potentially deadly allergy is oral immunotherapy, where patients eat small doses in graduating scales under medical care. The process can take up to a year and can cause allergic reactions.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/sm-ais110719.php">larger study is planned</a> to shore up dosing, timing and hopefully be used to treat other food allergies.</p>
