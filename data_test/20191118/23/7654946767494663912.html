      <h1>Women’s soccer team Sky Blue FC scores season at Red Bull Arena</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:12:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:12</time> by <a rel="author">Kirsten Fleming</a></address>
      <p>The sky is much bluer today for the women’s pro soccer team in New Jersey.</p>
      <p>The National Women’s Soccer League’s Sky Blue FC squad — which is owned by New Jersey governor Phil Murphy —  announced today that they will be playing all of their 2020 home games at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>The team, which is <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/15/carli-lloyd-world-cup-worst-time-of-my-life-because-i-didnt-play-enough/">led by US Women’s National team star Carli Lloyd</a>, is celebrating the move, as discussion <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/08/us-womens-soccer-team-equal-pay-gripe-is-less-than-it-seems/">heats up over equal pay in women’s soccer</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re thrilled to partner with the Red Bulls to expand support for professional women’s soccer,” said Sky Blue owner representative and Garden State first lady Tammy Murphy in a statement. “Last season demonstrated that we are ready to take our players and fans to the next level.”</p>
      <p>The news comes more than a year after a string of stories <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/26/draft-picks-bail-from-phil-murphys-soccer-team-over-broken-bathrooms/">exposed the players’ appalling living and training conditions</a>, including no bathrooms at their practice facilities and housing with plastic for windows.</p>
      <p>Last January, there was even more scrutiny after Verona native and University of North Carolina star Julia Ashley was drafted by the club but instead <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/09/nj-soccer-star-who-bailed-from-phil-murphys-team-thrives-in-sweden/">opted to play for a pro team in Sweden</a> because of the state of the club’s offerings.</p>

      <p>In the wake of the bad publicity, the first lady took a larger, more hands on role in the organization.</p>
      <p>The team has played their home games at Yurcak Field on the Rutgers Piscataway campus since their inception in 2009.</p>
      <p>Sky Blue FC played twice in the Red Bull Arena in 2019, including an August match up against Reign FC, where the club set an attendance record of 9,415.</p>
      <p>The club’s General Manager Alyse LaHue said in a statement that last season’s games led them to pursue a full-time partnership.</p>
      <p>“We’re extremely grateful to the Red Bulls organization for all their efforts in reaching this agreement, and will always remain thankful to Rutgers for their commitment to Sky Blue throughout the years,” added LaHue.</p>
      <p>In August, Lloyd <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/18/uswnt-stars-call-for-help-in-promoting-womens-soccer-league/">called for better promotion</a> of the women’s league.</p>
      <p>“The word has to get out,” Lloyd said. “There’s so many people in this country that have no idea there’s a women’s professional league, and that’s a problem.”</p>
