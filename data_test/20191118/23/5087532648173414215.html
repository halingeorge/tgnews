      <h1>Former Apple Director of Federal Sales David Sobotta – TMO Background Mode Interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:58:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/john-martellaro/" target="_blank">John Martellaro</a></address>
      <p>David Sobotta joined Apple in 1984. His career there lasted until July 2004. During that time David went from being an entry-level sales representative based in Halifax, Nova Scotia covering Atlantic Canada to the Reston, Virginia, based director of Apple’s federal sales group. He has gained an intimate knowledge of Apple, its culture and the leadership of Steve Jobs.</p>
      <p>David tells a story that started with the Apple II, learning the technology, going to work for a mini computer shop in Canada, growing the business so much that he got to know the Apple rep and then the serious attention of Apple. David evolved through business and then education, working with resellers, and eventually rose to the position of Apple Director of Federal Sales. We also chatted about Apple’s brief foray into selling supercomputers in 2004.</p>
