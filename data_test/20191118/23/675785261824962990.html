      <h1>Marcus Rashford talks up England's Euro 2020 attack: "It's frightening what we can do"</h1>
      <h2>Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane are must-picks for Gareth Southgate, with Rashford and Jadon Sancho vying to start in the Three Lions' first-choice starting lineup</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:16:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:16</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>He would be worth well over £100million on the open market and is in the goalscoring form of his short career.</p>
      <p>Only just turned 22 and, arguably, the quickest striker in the Premier League, there is also a sensational, long-range free-kick in his locker.</p>
      <p>Yet Marcus Rashford is still not guaranteed a starting place in his national side.</p>
      <p>And the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> forward has a word that covers that scenario. Frightening.</p>
      <p>While Gareth Southgate continues to scratch around for his best central defensive combination and his most effective midfield formula, he can rest easy when it comes to his attacking options.</p>
      <p>At least for now.</p>

      <p>It is simple. Perm three from four.</p>
      <p>Or – when Raheem is not ion the naughty step – pick either Rashford or Jadon Sancho to complete the trio with Sterling and Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>Between them, the four have scored 55 goals for club and country this season – and December is still some way off.</p>

      <p>Of the 37 goals England scored in their qualification campaign, this quartet weighed in with 23.</p>
      <p>Of the other 14, two were own goals. They are startling numbers.</p>
      <p>Rashford said: “It is frightening what we can do as a group of attackers.</p>
      <p>“If we go into the summer anywhere near the sort of form we have been in recently then it will be a successful tournament.”</p>

      <p>After again making a big impact when replacing Callum Hudson-Odoi against Kosovo on Sunday, Rashford seems to be ahead of Sancho in the pecking order.</p>
      <p>Once again, the link-up with Sterling and Kane looked natural.</p>
      <p>“I think it is obviously a good combination,” said Rashford. “But we have played games without that particular front-three and done well.</p>
      <p>“You have to use that to your advantage and if maybe it isn’t working in one game for that three, someone has to come in and make the difference.</p>
      <p>“I have been in two tournaments now and the squad is so important.</p>

      <p>“It is good competition – we really do have that kind of environment when we are in the camp together. It is so positive.”</p>
      <p>An eighth international goal came courtesy of the sort of crisp, instinctive finish that many thought was beyond Rashford.</p>
      <p>His scoring ratio has been under the spotlight for some time amid suggestions he is not naturally lethal in the penalty area.</p>
      <p>That is why the first-time hit against the Kosovans gave him as much pleasure as the dead-ball beauty from distance against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> the other week.</p>

      <p>He explained: “For me, when I score those type of goals – or even tap-ins – it holds bigger importance because I know those are the goals I need to get more of.</p>
      <p>“The spectacular goals come every once in a while, so if you want to become a great goalscorer you have to score all types of goals and that is the next step I am focusing on.”</p>
      <p>His focus on that target has been helped by automatic selection for his club, his confidence boosted by the faith of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>

      <p>Rashford said: “It had been a tough period and now I’m sort of getting consistent games and playing week in, week out and, as a forward, that has huge importance, especially with chances.</p>
      <p>“If you are not in the team or you are in and out, you don’t quite have that confidence in front of goal.</p>
      <p>“But when you are having a run in the team, it is important to come up with goods and once you do start doing that, it becomes second nature.”</p>
      <p>It is certainly second nature to Kane, as Rashford explains.</p>
      <p>“His finishing is second to none. Playing in and around him gives us a lot of confidence because if there is only one chance, you know that if it falls to him it is more than likely going to be a goal.</p>
      <p>"That breeds confidence throughout the team.”</p>
      <p>And right now, few look more confident than Rashford.</p>
      <p>Combine that with the brilliance of Sterling, the deadliness of Kane and the potential of Sancho and there is only one word for it.</p>
      <p>Frightening.</p>
