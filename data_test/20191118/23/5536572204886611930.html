      <h1>Antonio Brown Hints Eagles Should Sign Him After Terrible Offensive Performance vs. Patriots (PICS)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:15:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles had 10 points by the start of the second quarter following a successful review of Dallas Goedert’s catch in the end zone. The team wouldn’t score again for the remainder of the game and lost 17-10.</p>
      <p>The team desperately lacks the wide receivers to help with the passing attack, as DeSean Jackson has been out for much of the year due to injury. Alshon Jeffery is battling an ankle injury, while Nelson Agholor continues to drop crucial catches, much like one that could’ve tied the game late in the 4th quarter.</p>
      <p>That got Eagles fans to take to social media and implore Antonio Brown to come and save the team.</p>
      <p>Brown seemed to agree as he reposted several messages.</p>

      <p>Brown met with NFL investigators last week to discuss the sexual assault allegations against him, and although the meeting lasted some eight hours, it is not expected for the league to come to a final decision anytime soon. He could very well sign with a team right now, but then get put on the Commissioner’s exempt list and essentially suspend him with pay.</p>
      <p>The next time Brown might hit the field could very well be during the 2020 season.</p>
