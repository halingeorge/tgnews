      <h1>What If Rivian Built A Hardcore Off-Road Racing Truck?</h1>
      <h2>It wouldnâ€™t look out of place in the Baja 1000.</h2>

      <p>After lots of teasing, Tesla will finally unveil its new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/is-this-teslas-new-cybertruck">Blade Runner-inspired Cybertruck</a> this week. Tesla won't be the first automaker to enter this segment, however, as electric startup Rivian <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-has-400-mile-range-and-mind-blowing-performance">presented the R1T pickup nearly a year ago</a>, setting the standard with its impressive performance and range. Rivian is also making an <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/2021-rivian-r1s-electric-suv-arrives-to-join-truck-sibling">electric SUV called the R1S</a>. But what if the electric startup created a hardcore racing truck based on the R1T?</p>
      <p>To find out what such creation could look like, the <a href="https://www.rivianownersforum.com/threads/off-road-rivian-r1t-race-truck-rendering.213/">Rivian Owners Forum</a> has mocked up a speculative render of a Rivian R1T racing truck that wouldn't look out of place in the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/famous-races-baja-1000">Baja 1000</a>.</p>

      <p>The artists have envisioned Rivian's hypothetical racing truck with similar specifications to vehicles that compete in the Baja 1000. These include an aerodynamic body, beefy suspension travel, a safety cage, and larger wheels on chunky off-road tires. All of these modifications would clearly enhance the truck's off-road capability while making it look more aggressive.</p>
      <p>It still retains some aspects of the production model, however, such as a quad-motor setup and 180kWh battery pack that produces 754 horsepower, 826 lb-ft of torque, and 400 miles of range in the range-topping model. With this setup, 0-62 mph takes just three seconds. Other models will also be available with smaller 105-kWh and 135-kWh battery packs.</p>

      <p>With a ground clearance of up to 14.1 inches and approach and departure angles of 34 and 30 degrees, the Rivian R1T is already a highly capable off-roader without these modifications, but the racing version would no doubt take it to the next level with even better capability, more power, and less weight.</p>
      <p>We'd love to see a hardcore Rivian R1T in the vein of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/f-150-raptor">Ford F-150 Raptor </a>enter production, but it will have to remain a fantasy for now. Customer deliveries for the Rivian R1T are expected to start in late 2020, with prices starting at $69,000.</p>
