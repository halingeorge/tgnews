      <h1>BJD seeks Legislative Council in Odisha</h1>
      <h2>Last year, the regional party had passed a resolution in the state legislature regarding the formation of the Vidhan Parishad.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:05:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sampad-patnaik/" target="_blank">Sampad Patnaik</a></address>
      <p>The BJD on Monday asked the Central government to bring a resolution in the Rajya Sabha for the establishment of a Legislative Council in Odisha.</p>
      <p>“There is a resolution of Odisha Legislative Assembly about the formation of a second chamber — the state legislative council. It is pending with the Centre. I ask the Central government to bring it to this House (Rajya Sabha) in the form of a resolution. Let the House pass it,” said BJD Rajya Sabha MP Prasanna Acharya in the Upper House on Monday.</p>
      <p>Last year, the regional party had passed a resolution in the state legislature regarding the formation of the Vidhan Parishad.</p>
      <p>Sources in the BJD had said at the time that a second chamber would help CM <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/naveen-patnaik/">Naveen Patnaik</a> park leaders who may be denied tickets in the upcoming elections to Assembly and Lok Sabha.</p>
      <p>On Monday, some BJD MPs were upbeat after the Centre praised the party’s conduct in Parliament. A BJD leader said the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a>’s central leadership “may be inclined to help after Patnaik earlier this year threw support behind a candidate for the Rajya Sabha from the saffron party”.</p>
