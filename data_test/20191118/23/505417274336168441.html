      <h1>Mixed Emotions For Mick McCarthy As Denmark Draw Not Enough In Dublin</h1>

        <b>Ireland manager Mick McCarthy understandably had mixed emotions as he saw his side draw 1-1 against Denmark and miss out on automatic qualification for Euro 2020 at the Aviva on Monday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Boys in Green put in arguably their best performance of the campaign so far as they drew with their familiar foes but a point in their final group game wasn’t enough to see them into the two automatic qualification spots for next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>The likes of David McGoldrick, Matt Doherty and Glenn Whelan were all standouts in front of a raucous home crowd in Dublin, but the draw means that Ireland now face two one legged-playoff games in March.</p>

      <p>“I have mixed emotions,” explained McCarthy following the draw.</p>
      <p>“I’m disappointed that we didn’t qualify (automatically) but I’m immensely proud of my players.”</p>
      <p>“We played well and we competed well. I said before the game if they leave everything on the pitch and give everything for me, the lads, then I’ll take that and I’ve got to take the result but that is the only thing I’m disappointed with.”</p>
      <p>Ireland had the better of the opening 70 minutes in Dublin and when Denmark did find the goal through Martin Braithwaite it largely came against the run of play.</p>
      <p>McCarthy outlined that it’s “always a kick in the nuts when you concede” and the manner in which Ireland did, through the former Middlesbrough striker sneaking in between Shane Duffy and Doherty at the back post, certainly disappointing.</p>

      <p>The performance though will give McCarthy’s men a much needed boost ahead of March’s playoffs with Ireland knowing that if they can emulate Monday night’s display then they won’t be far off qualification.</p>
      <p>McCarthy believes that his side will be mentally tough enough to bounce back from the disappointment of the Danish draw.</p>
      <p>“We will come back in in March we’ll be playing a different team, we’ll come back and try and get a performance out of them. Sometimes I think you believe we are very shallow and we’re not mentally tough.</p>
      <p>“We have bad performances and bad results all the time, you’ve got to come back and play well. You have to get back in and get back it’s as simple as that and the lads have done it, I’m delighted with them.”</p>
