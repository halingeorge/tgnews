      <h1>George Conway blasts Nikki Haley, says her 'shameless' Trump defense is 'trashy'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:44:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:44</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>George Conway ratcheted up his vicious rhetoric toward former U.N. Ambassador <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-anderson-cooper-nikki-haley-trump">Nikki Haley</a> after she criticized him over his barrage of attacks targeting Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/elise-stefanik-elizabeth-warren-double-standard">Elise Stefanik</a>, R-N.Y.</p>
      <p>Conway, the outspoken anti-Trump husband of White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, called Stefanik "lying trash" after she had accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of trying to "silence" her during last Friday's public impeachment hearing, during which Schiff prevented her from asking questions to former U.S. diplomat Marie Yovanovitch per House rules.</p>
      <p>He also urged others to donate to the campaign of Stefanik's opponent. He later showed that he himself donated the legal maximum of $2,800 to the Democrat, former legislator Tedra Cobb.</p>

      <p>Haley knocked the attorney on Monday, calling his attacks on Stefanik "uncalled for and disgusting."</p>
      <p>"This is absolutely uncalled for and disgusting. What is wrong with people? George Conway is the last person that can call someone 'trash,'" Haley <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley/status/1196481073061998593">tweeted.</a></p>

      <p>Conway fired back and held no punches.</p>
      <p>"Oh, @NikkiHaley, just the other day you said that the world’s biggest pathological liar, @realDonaldTrump, was a “truthful” man. *That’s* the very essence of disgusting, trashy, and pathetic—utterly shameless and transparent dishonesty," Conway <a href="https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1196486880881266689">wrote.</a></p>
      <p>That was in reference to Haley's defense of President Trump, where she said he had always been "truthful" to her when asked if her former boss was a "truthful" person.</p>
      <p>He later suggested Haley would say "anything to get the vice-presidential nomination."</p>

      <p>Conway received backlash over the weekend after he retweeted an apparently edited image of Stefanik raising the middle finger during a round of applause Yovanovitch received at the end of the hearing, while doubling down on his "trashy" attacks.</p>
      <p>He later deleted the tweets, but did not offer an apology.</p>
