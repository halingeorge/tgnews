      <p>The Duke of Cambridge has given the comic two-hander of Romesh Ranganathan and Rob Beckett the “royal seal of approval” after they hosted the Royal Variety Performance.</p>
      <p>The duke and duchess were entertained by a cast of famous faces at this year’s show at the London Palladium on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Ranganathan and Beckett compered the show as the first comedic pair at the helm in more than 30 years, since Ronnie Corbett and Bruce Forsyth in 1988.</p>

      <p>Kate had earlier been handed a bouquet of flowers and William quipped: “How come she got a bouquet and I got a dodgy tea towel?”</p>
      <p>Beckett told the PA news agency that William had said to him: “I know you are not a double act but it’s really good – we give you the royal seal of approval.”</p>

      <p>“(William and Kate) are convinced we are a double act. They gave us the seal of approval.”</p>
      <p>Beckett joked: “He said I shouldn’t have got him the tea towel, which I think was a little bit ungrateful.”</p>
      <p>Other performers on the night included Cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, Cirque Du Soleil’s Luzia and the cast of Mary Poppins.</p>

      <p>“People don’t expect me to be nice. Kate and Wills have to be very nice.</p>
      <p>“He said he could talk for Britain. And I thought: ‘Well that’s lucky.’”</p>
      <p>Last year saw the Duchess of Sussex attend her first Royal Variety Performance alongside her husband, where they watched acts including Britain’s Got Talent’s 2018 winner Lost Voice Guy.</p>
      <p>Before the performance, William and Kate met actress Petula Clark and two of her co-stars in Mary Poppins, which is currently playing at the Prince Edward Theatre in nearby Soho.</p>

      <p>Kate responded by saying Charlotte, Louis and George would “love” it.</p>
      <p>The origins of the Royal Variety Performance date back to 1912, when King George V and Queen Mary agreed to attend a Royal Command Performance at the Palace Theatre in London, in aid of the Variety Artistes’ Benevolent Fund.</p>
      <p>The Royal Variety Performance will air on ITV in early December.</p>
