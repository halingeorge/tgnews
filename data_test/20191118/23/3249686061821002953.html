      <p><b>Hong Hyun Hee</b> has been determined as this popular star's doppelganger. </p>
      <p>She appeared on the November 18 broadcast of <b>'Unni's Salon' </b>when the cast members decided to find their doppelgangers through a phone application. </p>
      <p>As the broadcast started,<b> Jo Se Ho</b> announced that there was someone among the panelists who looked like Hong Hyun Hee. That person was no other than gorgeous actress <b>Han Ye Seul</b>. Although Han Hyun Hee embarrassingly stated that there must be a mistake, the other panelists continued to point out their similarities He then revealed an app slowly transforming the comedian into Han Ye Seul, noticing the similarities between them!</p>
      <p>Regardless of public opinion, we think both women are gorgeous and talented in their own unique ways. </p>
