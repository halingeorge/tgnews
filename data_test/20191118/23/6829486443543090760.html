      <h1>The Taylor Swift Vs. Scooter Braun Saga Just Turned Into An Even Bigger Clusterfuck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:57:58+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:57</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Over the last few weeks, Taylor Swift has been involved in an <a href="https://junkee.com/taylor-swift-big-machine-accusations/230264">increasingly ugly and public spat</a> with Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta, the two men who are now in control of her back catalogue after the sale of Swift’s old record label, Big Machine.</p>
      <p>According to a statement posted to Twitter by Swift, Borchetta and Braun were blocking the singer from performing her own songs at the upcoming American Music Awards, and from using them in a Netflix documentary about the last few years of her life.</p>

      <p>The statement went very viral, and <a href="https://junkee.com/taylor-swift-celebrities/230275">a number of celebrities waded in</a> to apply pressure to the two men.</p>
      <p>Now, it seems that the pressure has worked — but only somewhat. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/18/taylor-swift-amas-big-machine-record-label">per <i>The Guardian</i></a>, Swift will be able to perform her songs at the American Music Awards. According to a statement by Big Machine, Swift’s performance can be “stream[ed] post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms.”</p>
      <p>“The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms,” the <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/taylor-swift-amas-big-machine-dick-clark-productions-reach-agreement-1203408043/">statement read</a>. “This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performances.”</p>
      <p>Moreover, according to Big Machine, Swift didn’t need label approval for the performance in the first place: “Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.”</p>

      <p>But bizarrely enough, Dick Clark Productions — which is responsible for the American Music Awards — denied they had reached an agreement with Big Machine.</p>
      <p>“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorise or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” they <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-allowed-to-play-old-songs-at-2019-american-music-awards-ex-label-claims/">wrote in a statement</a> a short time ago. “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, there has been no clarification from Swift’s team or Big Machine.</p>
      <p>Whether or not Dick Clark Productions were involved in the statement, it still appears to be a big win for Swift — for the moment. After all, Dick Clark Productions wouldn’t have been able to halt Swift’s performing of her own songs; they’re kinda non-players, so their decision to clarify their involvement in the proceedings feels more like an attempt to get out of the way of all this mess.</p>
      <p>But there’s more trouble on the horizon for Swift, even if we chalk this one up as a sorta victory. According to <i>The Guardian</i>, the future of the Netflix documentary is still in doubt. As Swift outlined in her statement, Braun and Borchetta have been attempting to stop the musician from recording copy-cat versions of her old songs, a means by which she could retake control of her own back catalogue. If they succeed in stopping that, they’ll retain a lot of control over Swift’s music.</p>
      <p>It’s a win, but this ain’t over yet.</p>
