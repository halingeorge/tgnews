      <p>PALERMO, Nov 19 ― Ciro Immobile and Nicolo Zaniolo scored a brace each as Italy wrapped up their perfect Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a crushing 9-1 win over Armenia in Palermo today.</p>
      <p>Already-qualified Italy registered an 11th straight win under coach Roberto Mancini, as the four-time world champions showed they were back on track after failing to qualify for last year's World Cup for the first time since 1958.</p>
      <p>Mancini's side have won all 10 of their Group J matches and are assured of a seeding in the Euro 2020 draw on November 30.</p>
      <p>Immobile started the goal-spree on eight minutes in Sicily, adding a second in the 33rd minute.</p>
      <p>Roma midfielder Zaniolo scored his first goal for the national side on nine minutes, completing a brace on 64 minutes.</p>
      <p>Nicolo Barella also scored in the first half.</p>
      <p>Alessio Romagnoli, Jorginho's 75th-minute penalty, and goals from Riccardo Orsolini and Federico Chiesa concluded the hammering.</p>
      <p>Edgar Babayan pulled a goal back for Armenia 10 minutes from time in a rout which could have been heavier with the Azzurri rattling the woodwork on multiple occasions.</p>
      <p>This was not quite either Italy's biggest international score or their largest margin of victory.</p>
      <p>They beat Egypt 11-3 in the bronze-medal match at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam and the USA 9-0 at Brentford in the first round at the 1948 Olympics. In 1920, they beat France 9-4 in a friendly. ― AFP</p>
