      <h1>Panthers Owner Says Team Not Interested In Signing Colin Kaepernick</h1>

      <p>Eric Reid might want his good friend to sign with the Carolina Panthers as he stated after Sunday’s lost, but the team owner does not agree.</p>
      <p>Following Carolina’s blowout loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, Reid went on record campaigning for the quarterback to sign with the Panthers.</p>
      <p>24 hours later, Panthers owner David Tepper stated the team did not sent a representative to Kaepernick’s workout because they were not interested in any veteran quarterback, and that includes Colin Kaepernick.</p>

      <p>The entire workout took on a life of its won after Kaepernick’s team suddenly changed venues from the Falcons’ practice facility to a high school that was over an hour away.</p>
      <p>The Panthers are in severe need at the QB position as Cam Newton is currently on injured reserve with a Lisfranc injury and 2nd-year quarterback Kyle Allen is coming off a four-interception performance in Sunday’s loss to Atlanta.</p>
