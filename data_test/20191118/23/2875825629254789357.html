      <p>Mick McCarthy insists Euro 2020 qualification is still within Ireland’s grasp despite their shootout heartbreak against Denmark.<br/><br/>And his dugout rival Age Hareide is backing the Boys in Green to battle their way to the finals when they launch into the playoffs in March.<br/><br/>The Boys in Green must navigate a path through a playoff semi-final and final next year to reach the summer showpiece.<br/><br/>And they will know their opponents on Tuesday night with Slovakia, Wales and Bosnia still in the mix.<br/><br/>McCarthy’s men threw the kitchen sink at their old foes at a pulsating Aviva Stadium but Martin Braithwaite struck a killer blow before Matt Doherty’s late equaliser.</p>

      <p>McCarthy said: “I’m disappointed that we haven’t qualified - yet. But we’re in the playoffs so we’re not out of it and if we play like that, we can beat other teams.<br/><br/>“We have three months to prepare for that. Let’s wait and see who we get and then we’ll plan for that.<br/><br/>“But I’m really proud of the players and the way they performed, even more so after going 1-0 down. But it was a poor goal to give away.”<br/><br/>But Denmark boss Hareide said: "If Ireland keep going like that, they will qualifying through the play-offs."<br/><br/>McCarthy was left wondering what might have been after Ireland came up short despite spilling their guts for the cause.<br/><br/>Beauty is the eye of the beholder and the neutrals tuning in around Europe won’t have been ‘oohing’ and ‘aahing’ at the green shirts before them.<br/><br/>But if gasping, chaos-inducing , kitchen-sink-throwing football is your bag, well, they stumbled across something rather exquisite in its madness.<br/><br/>It’s an acquired taste and an approach that only carries Irish teams so far. Sometimes it works but quite often it doesn’t.<br/><br/>On a night when the result was king, and analysis of the style in which they played was irrelevant, the Boys in Green lost themselves in the mayhem of their art.<br/><br/>And yet one lapse in concentration when Matt Doherty and Shane Duffy switched off in the 73rd minute allowed Martin Braithwaite through to stab home.<br/><br/>McCarthy said: “The Doc allowed his man get a run on him but then he recovered and got the equaliser.<br/><br/>“I was in the dressing room giving out to him about the goal and I forgot to congratulate him on the one he scored.<br/><br/>“But I’m very proud of the lads because we played well and we competed well. If you leave everything on the pitch and give everything like they did, I’ll take that.<br/><br/>“The only thing I’m disappointed about was the goal. Of course it was (the turning point), but it’s not like we hadn’t played well up to that point.”</p>

      <p>But McCarthy knows Ireland will have to address their lack of teeth in the final third after scoring just seven goals in their eight games at the end of this campaign.<br/><br/>They are tasked with trying to win a one-legged semi-final and then a one-legged final over the space of six days in March.<br/><br/>“Seven in eight games, quite clearly that’s not good enough but we don’t get beat in many games and had we nicked it, we would have deserved it.  <br/><br/>“The lads played the way we asked them to play and we had a beautiful surface to play on.<br/><br/>“They will play for their clubs until March and then we’ll come back and play a different team and we’ll work towards that.<br/><br/>“We’ve had bad results before and yet they come back and play really well and I’m delighted with that. But it’s always a kick in the nuts when you concede like that.”<br/><br/>Danish boss Hareide added: “Ireland played well but we didn’t play well at all. I don’t know whether it was nerves or what but we got through it.<br/><br/>“When we got the goal the pressure eased off but after they scored they put a lot of pressure on us.<br/><br/>“They had to throw a lot of people forward and we had to try to defend with the same amount of people.<br/><br/>“But you have to gamble sometimes to have counter-attacks but we didn’t put counter-attacks in the way we wanted.<br/><br/>“We were lucky to get the draw. But this is a fantastic place to play, with the fans, their songs and their enthusiasm, it’s really good. We feel at home in Dublin.”</p>
