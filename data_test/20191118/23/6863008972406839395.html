      <p>German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas canceled a scheduled trip to Donbas due to poor weather conditions, the German Foreign Ministry reports.</p>
      <p>It was planned that Maas would fly to Kharkiv tonight, and tomorrow morning – to the line of contact in Donbas, by helicopter, according to <a href="https://p.dw.com/p/3TFvL">Deutsche Welle</a>.</p>
      <p>Due to heavy fog on November 18, many flights were canceled or delayed at Kharkiv Airport.</p>
      <p>The German Foreign Ministry said that Maas would fly immediately to Kyiv on November 19. He is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko.</p>
      <p>The German Foreign Minister plans to discuss further steps that could be taken during the Norman Four summit, scheduled for December 9 in Paris. Leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany, and France will be taking part.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the four countries met for the first time in 2014 to negotiate settlement in Donbas. The last time the Normandy Four summit took place was in autumn 2016, in Berlin.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported, today, November 18, the Kremlin confirmed that preparations for the summit had entered its final stage.</p>
