      <h1>Hyundai Venue Garners 80,000 Bookings In Just 6 Months</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:41:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://gaadiwaadi.com/author/pranavsiddharth0303/" target="_blank">Team GaadiWaadi</a></address>
      <h3>Priced in a range of Rs 6.5 – 11.1 Lakh (ex-showroom), the Hyundai Venue has been a direct rival of the hot-selling Maruti Vitara Brezza, Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV300 and Ford EcoSport</h3>
      <p>On one hand, the Indian auto sector has been gripped in a sales slowdown for several months now, and on other, new entrants like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Seltos and MG Hector have been busy setting new sales records.</p>
      <p>Only last month, we reported that the Hyundai Venue, which has been a strong Maruti Vitara Brezza rival, has received 42,000 bookings, with 15,000 orders already been completed.</p>
      <p>In a new development, however, it has come to light that the Hyundai Venue has garnered a total of 80,000 bookings so far. This means that the compact SUV has received almost a whopping 40,000 bookings in last 30 days or so. What this also means is that the new entrant has managed to leave a lasting impression on the new car buyers in spite of facing poor market sentiments.</p>

      <p>The Hyundai Venue is available in a price range of Rs 6.5 – 11.1 lakh (ex-showroom). The sub-4-metre SUV has been on sale with three engine options – 1.2-litre petrol, 1.0-litre turbo petrol and 1.4-litre turbo diesel.</p>
      <p>The diesel motor of the Hyundai Venue produces a max power of 90 hp, while the 1.2-litre naturally-aspirated petrol engine outputs 83 hp. The top-of-the-line 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine offers 120 hp, which makes the Venue among the most potent models in its segment.</p>

      <p>The 1.2-litre petrol engine comes mated to a 5-speed manual transmission, while the diesel motor is paired with a 6-speed manual unit. The 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine though, is available with a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed DCT automatic transmission choice.</p>
      <p>Soon, the Venue will have to face increased heat from a comprehensively updated Maruti Vitara Brezza that will get the Ciaz-sourced 1.5-litre petrol engine with mild-hybrid option, along with several other minor updates.</p>
