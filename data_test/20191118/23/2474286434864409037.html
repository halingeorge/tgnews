      <p>The drought won't stop the Moree Show from going ahead next year, as sponsorship for 2020 kicks off with a generous donation from the Commonwealth Bank.</p>
      <p>The Moree branch has generously donated $500, as part of a nationwide community donation program, to Moree Show Society for the upcoming 2020 Moree Show.</p>
      <p>Commonwealth Bank Moree branch manager Marla Kennedy said that she is pleased to be given the opportunity to support the Moree Show in times of such need.</p>
      <p>"We're very excited to have the opportunity to support the Moree show, particularly in such a challenging time," she said.</p>
      <p>"This drought takes its toll on us all, especially small towns like ours so it's great to be able to give back and support the great work of the Moree Show Society."</p>

      <p>Given that there was a chance that the <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6092004/smell-of-dagwood-dogs-in-the-air-as-2019-moree-show-kicks-off-photos/">Moree Show</a> would not be able to run this year as a result of the drought, Moree Show Society president Brendan Munn said the committee was thrilled to welcome their first sponsorship donation for 2020 and look forward to putting on another top show for the community.</p>
      <p>"The drought has hit us hard," he said.</p>
      <p>"But not running the show next year is not an option.</p>
      <p>"This donation to kick things off from the staff at the Moree branch Commonwealth Bank is a great start and we are excited about them coming on board as sponsors for the 2020 Moree Show."</p>
      <p>Moree Show Society would love to hear from other businesses interested in sponsoring the 2020 show.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Moree Show is set for April 24 and 25.</p>
