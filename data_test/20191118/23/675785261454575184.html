      <h1>Couple baffled by 'broken socket' under stairs left amazed by what it actually is</h1>
      <h2>Darren Steels and his partner were bewildered by the double plug socket that simply didn't work in Nottingham - but there was a pretty straight forward reason for it</h2>

      <p>It was a mystery that went back to when Darren Steels first bought his home in 2017.</p>
      <p>The incredibly useful double plug socket in the kitchen - in a prime location near the bottom of the stairs.</p>
      <p>For more than two years, Darren and his partner were bewildered by why it simply refused to work, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/homeowner-who-been-baffled-broken-3549295">report Nottinghamshire Live.</a></p>
      <p>In fact it had never worked since they bought the property in Bolingey Way in the Hucknall part of Nottingham back in July 2017.</p>
      <p>And that was a source of some frustration for the couple.</p>
      <p>"We tried to plug things into it,” said Darren.</p>

      <p>“It's perfectly placed for vacuuming the stairs, instead of having the cord running across the kitchen floor,” he added.</p>
      <p>The socket didn’t feel loose and when the couple had decorators in to redo the kitchen soon after they moved in, nothing was flagged up.</p>
      <p>“People have just painted around it,” the 45-year-old added.</p>
      <p>Eventually, they decided to ask an electrician to try and sort it out.</p>

      <p>"I was just fed up with it," Darren said. "We had an electrician come round to do some other bits and bobs and I asked him to have a look at it."</p>
      <p>The electrician confirmed there was no current to the socket, before trying to tackle the problem in a different way.</p>
      <p>“He prised it open, and it came away from the wall,” added restaurant manager Darren.</p>
      <p>And what was revealed was - a secret safe.</p>

        <figcaption>It was only a wall safe - like you used to get in Argos</figcaption>

      <p>Sadly, though, it wasn’t filled with cash or valuables. "There was just dust, fluff and a dead spider in it."</p>
      <p>He posted a video of it online on Sunday, November 17 - and people have been loving it, with more than 60,000 views so far.  </p>
      <p>"I have a socket that doesnt work....absolutely checking it later!!" said one <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user.</p>
      <p>"Thats both hilarious and sort of James Bond," said Martyn.</p>
      <p>"I always wanted one of those as a kid," said Paul.</p>
      <p>"Don’t store anything too valuable in there now," warned Craig. "People will know!! Brilliant idea though. Alf &amp; Audrey had one on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> ."</p>
      <p>"I remember seeing those in the Argos catalogues in the 90’s," said Gaz. "Always wanted one."</p>
      <p>The safe should have a key which slots into one of the the holes for the plug pins, but it was unlocked - and Darren said he didn't have the key for it.</p>
      <p>However, he said he would be keeping the safe as it was, for "posterity".</p>
