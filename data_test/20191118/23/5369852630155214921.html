      <p>Darren Randolph<br/>6Our Rating<br/>His distribution was poor at times, and he didn't have much to do otherwise. Couldn't be faulted for the goal.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>Matt Doherty<br/>6Our Rating<br/>Scored to get Ireland back in the game and had a couple of good moments in attack, but failed to track Martin Braithwaite for the goal.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>Shane Duffy<br/>6Our Rating<br/>Played the Danish attacker on for the goal, though Doherty was arguably more culpable. Didn't do a lot wrong otherwise.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>John Egan<br/>7Our Rating<br/>Made one or two good interceptions and snuffed out danger well, before being taken off at half-time, presumably with an injury.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>Enda Stevens<br/>6Our Rating<br/>Produced a terrific cross for the goal, but will be disappointed he couldn't get into attacking positions more regularly.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>Alan Browne<br/>5Our Rating<br/>Offered plety of energy and had one decent attempt in the first half, but ultimately didn't look totally comfortable on the right-hand side.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>Glenn Whelan<br/>6Our Rating<br/>Gave the ball away cheaply on occasion and his set pieces were a mixed bag, but put in a few good tackles and screened the back four well for the most part. Replaced by Sean Maguire with 10 minutes remaining.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>Jeff Hendrick<br/>5Our Rating<br/>Had one or two neat moments, but didn't really do enough over the 90 minutes and his status as an automatic starter will surely be questioned now.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>Conor Hourihane<br/>5Our Rating<br/>Produced a few decent deliveries from set pieces, but didn't influence the play enough before being replaced by Callum Robinson in the 68th minute.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>

      <p>James McClean<br/>6Our Rating<br/>Ran his heart out over the 90 minutes, which should not be taken for granted, but like Ireland's attackers in general, lacked composure in the final third.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>David McGoldrick<br/>7Our Rating<br/>A deserved man of the match, held the ball up really well at times and made the most of having to feed off scraps.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy<br/>5Our Rating<br/>His brief at the start of the campaign was to secure qualication and that outcome is looking increasingly unlikely. A bad night for him.<br/>6 <br/>Your<br/>Rating<br/>◆<br/>Readers<br/>Rating</p>
      <p><b>Subs:</b> Sean Maguire and Callum Robinson added a degree of energy and urgency to the attack, while Ciaran Clark didn’t do much wrong at the back and was a threat from set pieces down the other end. <b>6</b></p>
