      <p>VAN NUYS, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- It's been years since Army Private First Class Gordon Reynertson has been in a World War II plane.<br/><br/>He and other war veterans took flight from Van Nuys Airport, in a Boeing Stearman World War II biplane - a plane once used to train aviators for combat back in 1943.<br/><br/>"I'm just looking forward to getting into this thing and flying," said Reynertson<br/>Reynertson knows it well from his time as a 19 year-old in France as an Army Private First Class.<br/><br/>"There was always one of these ahead of us whenever we went anywhere, because the Germans didn't bother them, they'd rather shoot at us," he said.<br/><br/>The flight was made possible by the <a href="https://agelessaviationdreams.org/">Ageless Aviation Dreams Foundation</a>.<br/><br/>Pilot Mike Sommars is the volunteer captain taking veterans up.<br/>"If I got paid to do this it wouldn't be any fun," Sommars said.<br/><br/>The veterans are between the ages of 87 to 97-years-old and live at the same retirement community in Glendale.<br/><br/>"They come back with all the stories," Sommars said. "And they are stories that they haven't even recalled."<br/><br/>"You sit there buckled up...when you're sitting you can't see anything because the nose is up," said Bob Wilkins, who was an Airman Second Class in the Air Force.<br/><br/>"Then when you take off...then everything just calms down, the noise quietens, and then they start doing a little maneuvering. And so you have a little more fun, it's a great experience," Wilkins said.<br/>Each flight, lasts about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>"Great! It was fabulous. I could see stuff I never dreamt about," Reynertson said.<br/><br/>He said he wants to salute those who made it possible. "I want to thank them 1,000 times. It was really nice", he said.</p>
