      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joel-dommett/">Joel Dommett</a> has been criticised after referring to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> as a ‘guy’ during the first episode of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>: Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>The opening night of I’m A Celeb saw <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebritycaitlyn-jenner-kardashians-11170629/">Kylie and Kendall Jenner</a>’s parent, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebs-caitlyn-jenner-confessed-fantasy-becoming-woman-45-years-transition-11170162/">who is transgender</a>, pair up with rugby player James Haskell before losing the challenge and having to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-a-celebrity-2019-caitlyn-jenner-spends-first-night-in-snake-rock-on-basic-rations-11171818/">spend a night at the uncomfortable Snake Rock</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the shock loss for the team of sports players – Caitlyn is a former Olympic decathlete – over on the ITV2 companion show, stand up comedian and Extra Camp host Joel put his foot in his mouth while presenting.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘How do you think that the two athletes, Caitlyn and James, ended up in Snake Rock,’ he asked panellists Alison Hammond and John Barrowman while sitting with co-host Emily Atack.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I can’t believe that, the two fittest guys, you know?’</p>
      <p>While ‘guys’ can be a gender neutral term, many fans took the context which it was spoken in to mean that Joel had accidentally referred to Caitlyn as male.</p>

      <p>‘Please never refer to @Caitlyn_Jenner as a guy again,’ one viewer wrote, while another said that they were ‘disgusted’ to hear the reality star be misgendered on TV.</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk has contacted I’m A Celebrity for comment.</p>
      <p>Referring to a transgender person by the gender or name they no longer identify with is called deadnaming and is considered to be extremely offensive and harmful by trans-support charities.</p>

      <p>During Sunday night’s premiere episode, Caitlyn’s birth name Bruce Jenner trended on Twitter, with many viewers using the name in a transphobic manner.</p>
      <p>However, the I Am Cait star for the most part impressed audiences in the show’s opening episode, bringing the humour with her after admitting that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-awkwardness-caitlyn-jenner-admits-doesnt-know-uk-celebs-11172779/">she had no idea who her fellow campmates were</a>.</p>
