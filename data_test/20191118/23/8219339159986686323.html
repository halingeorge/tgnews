      <p>With more recent years, Apple has been publishing other types of content to this app, including technical videos of new features in recently released hardware such as new iPhones or iPads. It looks like this change has prompted Apple to rename the WWDC app to simply be called “Apple Developer”.</p>
      <p>One of the new features in the Apple Developer app is the ability for developers in the US to enroll in the Apple Developer Program directly within the app. Apple says the new feature will be coming to new territories soon.</p>
