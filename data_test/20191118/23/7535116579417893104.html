      <p>About a month ago, we reported that <a href="https://www.worldofbuzz.com/breaking-schools-will-not-have-science-and-art-streams-starting-2020/">there will no longer be a science and/or arts streams for Form Four students</a>. In replacement of the system, students will get to choose subjects that they want to learn. <i>Seems like a great initiative!</i></p>
      <p>Malaysian Deputy Minister of Education, Teo Nie Ching said that the school counsellor will play a significant role in helping the students figure out the classes which are apt for them.</p>
      <p>Well, it looks like this is all coming true now because <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/539839/no-more-artsscience-streams-form-four-next-year">NST</a> just reported that there will no longer be arts/science streams for Form Four students starting 2020. <i>Rejoice, fellow students! </i></p>
      <p>The streams will be replaced with relevant subjects and electives, according to Teo. This time the announcement is for real because a letter about the changes had been distributed to secondary schools all over Malaysia. <b>Arts/science streams will be substituted with STREAM (Science, Technology, Reading, Arts &amp; Music) education.</b></p>

      <p>Teo was quoted as saying,</p>
      <p>“The letter/circular contains advice to schools across the country on how to encourage, evaluate and explain about the new subjects available from next year (2020).”</p>
      <blockquote>“This (the abolition of arts and science for Form 4 students) needs to be done according to the capabilities, availability, suitability (facilities/infrastructure), as well as considerations of each school.”</blockquote>
