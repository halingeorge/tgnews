      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A state agency report shows Rhode Island's nursing and residential care program for veterans is having financial issues.</p>
      <p>WPRI reports the Rhode Island Office of Veteran Services has projected a nearly $3 million deficit for this fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The agency's issues stem from widespread miscalculations of costs, staff and the newly renovated Veterans Home in Bristol.</p>
      <p>A quarterly financial report released by the state department last week shows that the agency operating Veteran Homes is one of only a few departments that is running at a multimillion-dollar deficit.</p>
      <p>Gov. Gina Raimondo says the cleaning contract for the care complex is much higher than expected because of its size.</p>
      <p>The long-term care facility with more than 200 beds designated for veterans has been in high demand since it opened in 2017.</p>
