      <h1>Sources: Luis Enrique to return as Spain coach as Robert Moreno to be sacked</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:43:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:43</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p>Spain coach Robert Moreno is to be dismissed from the role, sources have told ESPN's Rodrigo Faez, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/match?gameId=528860">after Moreno's side thrashed Romania 5-0</a> in their final Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday.</p>
      <p>Former Spain coach Luis Enrique is set to make a sensational return five months after resigning from the role due to the illness of his daughter Xana, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/spain/story/3931237/luis-enrique-shares-news-of-daughters-death">who died in September</a>.</p>
      <p>Multiple Spanish outlets reported the move following Monday's match.</p>
      <p>The Spanish football federation announced that their president, Luis Rubiales, and sporting director, Jose Francisco Molina, will hold a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Moreno -- Luis Enrique's long-time assistant who was given the top job in June -- refused to give the usual postmatch news conference and did not speak to any media, where he bid farewell to the players after the game in tears.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Moreno told players: "Thank you very much; you deserve the best. We have been through tough times, and you have been great professionals."</p>
      <p>The relationship between Luis Enrique and Moreno has soured in recent weeks, sources added, with the two angry at each other. If confirmed, Luis Enrique is to choose Juan Carlos Unzue as his assistant.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/spain/story/3934695/spains-moreno-id-step-aside-for-luis-enrique">Moreno said in September</a> that he would step down from the job if Luis Enrique were to return.</p>
      <p>Moreno, an international relations graduate who had no playing career, was thrust into the biggest job in Spanish football in unusual circumstances following Luis Enrique's resignation in June.</p>
      <p>Questions about Moreno's suitability for the role began to emerge following sluggish 1-1 draws away to Norway and Sweden in October, although Spain responded to those results by hammering Malta 7-0 on Friday to clinch top spot in Group F.</p>
      <p>Doubts grew about Moreno's future when federation president Rubiales declined to say whether he would be in charge at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Moreno said before the Romania game that he was not ruffled by Rubiales' dithering over his future and suggested he was confident he would remain in charge.</p>
      <p>"It's normal that you are questioned in your job, especially if you are in the spotlight, and all I can do is focus on my work. I think I have a 10 out of 10 chance of staying," he said.</p>
