      <h1>Exclusive: First Look At Marauders #7 &amp; 8 Covers and Solicits</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:14:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:14</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>In the Dawn of X, the X-Men have risen again and claimed the sentient island, Krakoa, as the new mutant homeland. But not every mutant can reach the promised land. That’s where Kate Pryde, Storm, Pyro, Iceman, and Bishop come in. As the Marauders, they smuggle mutants to Krakoa while sailing the high seas. Emma Frost, a.k.a. the White Queen, is openly pulling the strings via the Hellfire Trading Company.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Marvel’s February 2020 solicitations, Superhero Hype has the exclusive first look at <b>Marauders</b> #7 and #8. Russell Dauterman is the cover artist for issue 7, which features the return of Callisto. She’s the former leader of the Morlocks and Storm’s long-time rival. Callisto hasn’t been spotted on Krakoa. However, the fact that she’s facing off with Bishop and Pyro suggests that she’s on the opposite side.</p>
