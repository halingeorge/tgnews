      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/victoria-beckham">Victoria Beckham</a> really let her hair down when she danced around the kitchen to a Spice Girls classic.</p>
      <p>The Posh Spice star, who didn't take part in the group's recent reunion tour, showed off her moves as she teamed up with son Romeo for an impromptu performance of Spice Up Your Life.</p>
      <p>Victoria, dressed head to toe in black apart from her bright yellow trainers, shimmied and shaked her groove thing along to the pop hit as she harked back to the good old days.</p>
      <p>Romeo, dressed in black too, but with a yellow smiley face on the front of his jumper, joined in with his mum as they showed off their moves together.</p>

      <p>The 17-year-old shared the video on TikTok on Sunday, sending Spice Girls fans wild.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-four, 45, shared the video on her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> Story, writing: "Go watch our TikTok" followed by a laughing emoji.</p>
      <p>Fans were loving it.</p>
      <p>One begged Romeo: "Tell your mom to join the Spice Girls reunion tour"</p>
      <p>"Iconic," another labelled it.</p>

      <p>And another said: "I'd buy tickets to this show! YASSSS"</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Mel B, Mel C, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton got back together to put on a huge tour, but Victoria didn't take part.</p>
      <p>It's said that despite not heading out on the road, Victoria made a cool £30,000 from the tour thanks to licensing rights.</p>

      <p>A music source told <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> : "There are no hard feelings at all between the girls, this is just a business arrangement and canny businesswoman Victoria simply wants to get what she feels she earned from her previous years in the band."</p>
      <p>Victoria, who has since become a hugely successful fashion designer, is estimated to be worth £350 million.</p>
