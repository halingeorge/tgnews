      <h1>Court hears prison computer ‘not suitable’ for Julian Assange to mount case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:59:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/jessglass/" target="_blank">Jess Glass</a></address>
      <p>Julian Assange is unable to work on his extradition case because he has been given an unsuitable computer in prison, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old WikiLeaks founder is accused of leaking US government secrets in one of the largest breaches of confidential information.</p>
      <p>Appearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court via video-link on Monday, Assange wore a grey prison-issue jumper and spoke only to confirm his identity.</p>
      <p>He had his white hair slicked back, appeared to have stubble and wore thin-rimmed glasses which he cleaned on his top before the judge entered.</p>
      <p>The court appearance came on the same day that <a href="https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2019/11/18/news/a_massive_scandal_how_assange_his_doctors_lawyers_and_visitors_were_all_spied_on_for_the_u_s_-241314527/?refresh_ce"><i>La Repubblica</i> reported Assange and his lawyers and supporters were recorded by a Spanish firm during his seven years in the Ecuador embassy</a> in London.</p>

      <p>During the five-minute hearing, which was attended by supporters including his father John Shipton, Assange’s remand in HMP Belmarsh was extended.</p>
      <p>He was to be released from the high-security prison in September but was remanded in custody due to fears he would abscond after he spent nearly seven years in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.</p>
      <p>Gareth Peirce, representing Assange, told the court her client was unable to adequately prepare for his “very challenging case” as the computer he had been given was not suitable.</p>
      <p>“I will put it on the record. You will understand that we are working extremely hard on this very challenging case; however, the most important of the impediments that we are facing is Mr Assange’s ability to access what he needs to work on his own case,” she said.</p>
      <p>“After months of battle he was provided with a computer but it is not the sort of computer needed to work on the case.”</p>
      <p>District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said she had no jurisdiction over prison conditions.</p>
      <p>Ms Peirce replied she wanted to “exert pressure as best we can” on Belmarsh to improve the computer facilities.</p>
      <p>Speaking outside court, a member of Assange’s team said the computer was unlikely to have internet access for research.</p>
      <p>District Judge Baraitser remanded Assange in custody ahead of a substantive case management hearing next month.</p>
      <p>He will also appear again at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on December 13 to confirm his remand in prison again before he ultimately appears for full extradition proceedings in February.</p>
