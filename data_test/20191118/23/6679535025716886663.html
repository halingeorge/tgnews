      <p>The South Asian Fishermen Fraternity (SAFF) on Monday appealed to the Central and State governments to initiate immediate steps for safe and early release of three fishermen jailed in Abu Dhabi for reportedly entered its territorial waters.</p>
      <p>In a petition submitted to Collector Prashant M. Wadnere, SAFF general secretary Rev. Fr. Churchill said Arockiyam, 44, and Michael Nayagam, 49, both from Kadiyapattinam in Kanniyakumari district, and Kaliappan, 39, of Thirumullaivasal in Nagapattinam district, who were employed in a mechanised fishing vessel registered in Iran, went for fishing from their base at Keez in Iran on October 25.</p>
      <p>When they were in deep sea on October 29, they were detained by Abu Dhabi Coast Guard for allegedly entering the waters of the country. They were arrested and lodged in a prison at Al-Bahra.</p>
      <p>The families of the fishermen could not contact them and were concerned about their safety. Hence, the Indian government should take early steps to ensure their safe release from prison. They should also be emplaned from Abu Dhabi to India instead of sending them back to Iran where they would be imprisoned for entering the waters of Abu Dhabi, he said.</p>
