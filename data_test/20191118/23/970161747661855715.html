      <p>The United States will no longer consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law in a move that breaks with decades of policy.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repudiated a 1978 State Department legal opinion that held that civilian settlements in the occupied territories are ‘inconsistent with international law’.</p>
      <p>The decision has angered Palestinians and put the US at odds with nations working to bring the long-running conflict to an end.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration believes the former policy hasn’t advanced the cause of peace and says any legal questions about the issue should be addressed by Israeli courts, Mr Pompeo stated.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law has not advanced the cause of peace.</p>

      <p>‘The hard truth is that there will never be a judicial resolution to the conflict and arguments about who is right and who is wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace.’</p>
      <p>Mr Pompeo added the US wouldn’t take a position on the legality of specific settlements, that the new policy wouldn’t extend beyond the West Bank and that it would not create a precedent for other territorial disputes.</p>

      <p>He also claimed the change in policy did not mean the administration was prejudging the status of the West Bank in any eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.</p>
      <p>The 1978 legal opinion on settlements – known as the Hansell Memorandum – sets out US opposition to settlement construction.</p>
      <p>It has been in place in one way or another – depending on the sitting president’s position on the matter – for more than 40 years.</p>
      <p>The international community overwhelmingly considers the settlements illegal.</p>
      <p>This is based in part on the Fourth Geneva Convention, which stops an occupying power from transferring parts of its own civilian population to occupied territory.</p>
      <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdeneh, has condemned the announcement, saying: ‘The US administration has lost its credibility to play any future role in the peace process.’</p>
      <p>He added that settlements are illegal under international law.</p>
      <p>It is not the first move from the Trump Administration that has been seen to weaken Palestinian efforts.</p>

      <p>Others include Donald Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, as well as the relocation of the US Embassy and the closure of the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington.</p>

      <p>The move could be seen as a boost to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been unable to form a coalition government following elections.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu’s office has claimed the policy shift ‘rights a historical wrong’.</p>
      <p>A statement read: ‘This policy reflects an historical truth – that the Jewish people are not foreign colonialists in Judea and Samaria.’</p>
