      <h1>Samsung brings Galaxy Watch Active 2 features to the Galaxy Watch &amp; Watch Active</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:54:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/mweinbach/" target="_blank">Max Weinbach</a></address>
      <p>For the past few years, Samsung smartwatches have had physical rotating bezels as a way to control their watch UI. Sadly, Samsung removed it with this years’ Galaxy Watch Active and Galaxy Watch Active 2. Luckily, with the new Watch Active 2, Samsung introduced its new touch bezel. This touch bezel emulated the rotating bezel by allowing users to slide their finger around the display as though there was a physical bezel, even though there wasn’t one. In the latest Galaxy Watch Active update, Samsung was able to backport the touch bezel, along with a few other features, back to the first Galaxy Watch Active.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/new-galaxy-watch-and-watch-active-ux-offers-users-enhanced-features-found-on-galaxy-watch-active2">new update</a>, which should be rolling out now, Samsung was able to backport the touch bezel to the Galaxy Watch Active. This lets you rotate your finger around the bezel to control the watch. You can switch between widgets, scroll through notifications, or scroll through pages. It makes using the watch easier and more natural.</p>

      <p>While the Galaxy Watch didn’t get the touch bezel because it has a physical one, Samsung still brought the rest of the feature set back to the regular Watch and the Watch Active. These improvements include a few changes in apps like Samsung Health, like lap time tracking for running and cycling and data sync via NFC for Technogym workout equipment. They also improved the always-on display while charging or in power saver and improved the customization of the quick settings.</p>
      <p>Samsung brought back One UI 1.5 to the Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Watch Active. With this, Samsung added a few new watch complications like a “Begin Workout” button, breathing, and more. In addition to this, Samsung added their “My Style” feature. This lets you take a picture of your clothes in the Galaxy Wearables app and the background of the watch face will match with the clothes you are wearing. Samsung has also added a new indicator to show when an app is running in the background. Clicking the icon will open the running app, letting you interact with it. Samsung has also added a few new emojis and finally added skin tones to the emojis on the watch.</p>
      <p>It’s great to see Samsung backporting features like this. It really helps consumers not feel left out when new updates and devices are released. With these devices ranging from being from 6 months to 1 year old, getting regular updates with new features is great to see, and something very few other companies are reliably doing.</p>
