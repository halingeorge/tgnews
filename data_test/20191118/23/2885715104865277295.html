      <p>The Delhi High Court on Monday said there was no “cut and paste” in its November 15 order denying bail to former Union finance minister P Chidambaram in the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/chidambaram-inx-media-scam-case-explained-karti-5921402/">INX Media</a> money laundering case.</p>
      <p>Justice Suresh Kumar Kait took suo motu cognizance of a media report in The Hindu on 17.11.19 which stated that parts of Chidambaram’s bail order resemble an order passed on the bail plea of lawyer Rohit Tandon in a money laundering case. It was pointed out to him that <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> on 18.11.19 had carried similar news.</p>
      <p>Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said, “I hereby clarify that in paragraph No. 34 of the judgement dated 15.11.2019 (in the case of P Chidambaram), only a reference to the observations made by this court in ‘Rohit Tandon vs Enforcement Directorate’ in bail application No. 119/2017 has been recorded.</p>
      <p>“In paragraph No. 35, the facts of the aforesaid case have been mentioned. It has nowhere been mentioned that the observations made in para 35 of the judgement are of the present case (in the case of P Chidambaram). Thus, there is no cut and paste as alleged and I hereby make it clear that observations made in paragraph No. 35 shall be read as and are confined to the case of ‘Rohit Tandon vs Enforcement Directorate’.” Both newspapers were directed to carry clarifications today.</p>
      <p>“The above mentioned portion of the judgment dated 15.11.2019 passed in Bail Appln No. 2718/2019 titled as ‘P Chidambaram vs Directorate of Enforcement’ thus stands clarified,” Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said.</p>
