      <p>Yaya Toure has surprisingly named <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> midfielder <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nemanja-matic/">Nemanja Matic</a> as his toughest opponent.</p>
      <p>Ivory Coast legend Toure would regularly come up against Matic during his eight-year spell in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>.</p>
      <p>Toure, who left English football last year, helped City win three Premier League titles and the FA Cup during his stint at the Etihad.</p>

      <p>Serbian midfielder Matic enjoyed two spells at Chelsea while Toure was at City and then joined Manchester rivals United in 2017.</p>
      <p>Matic emerged as a key player for former manager Jose Mourinho but has fallen out of favour under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, although he will hope to revive his career once he returns from injury.</p>
      <p>Asked to name the most difficult opponent he came up against during a brilliant career which also included spells at Barcelona and Monaco, Toure said: ‘Nemanja Matic was complicated.</p>

      <p>‘He’s not quick but he’s so strong, clever.’</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old added to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/yaya-toure-i-went-to-manchester-city-to-make-them-great-people-were-laughing-at-the-start-pq9kggpqn">The Times</a>: ‘All the rest of the opponents, because I always looked at them carefully before games, I get their weakness.’</p>
      <p>Toure also revealed how his move from Barcelona to Manchester City materialised and how he was determined to help turn the Premier League club into champions.</p>

      <p>‘I was on the phone with [chief executive] Garry Cook. He promised me he was going to bring players to help me to do great things at City,’ Toure said.</p>
      <p>‘I said, ‘Sign David Silva first, and I will come.’ And Silva was saying, ‘Sign Yaya first and I will come!’ I said to Silva, ‘Sign! I am not going to run off!’</p>
      <p>‘He didn’t believe me because I was at Barcelona, one of the top teams in the world. But it was time for change. Kolo told me to come. I have to listen to him.</p>

      <p>‘When I come to City, I said, ‘I come here to win and make City one of the greatest teams in the Premier League.’ People were laughing at me in the beginning.</p>
      <p>‘I make my team-mates realise what we can become by starting with one trophy, the FA Cup.’</p>
      <p>Toure finished his Manchester City career with 79 goals from 316 appearances.</p>
