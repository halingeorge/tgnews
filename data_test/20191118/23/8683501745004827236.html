      <p>Because of his temporary removal from <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>, James Gunn won’t be able to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482195/dont-worry-james-gunn-has-big-plans-for-kraglin-in-guardians-3">tackle the highly-anticipated threequel</a> until he’s finished with <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, meaning it will be a while until hear anything in the way of casting. Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped speculation, and one name that’s been tossed around is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484378/watch-mark-hamill-hilarious-reaction-to-his-original-star-wars-audition">Mark Hamill, <i>Star Wars</i>… uh, star extraordinaire</a>.</p>
      <p>But James Gunn is making it perfectly clear that Mark Hamill is not being lined up to join <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>. Here’s how he responded when a fan asked him if he and Hamill were still in talks for the latter to show up in the movie:</p>
      <blockquote>Mark is my friend. We have never had these talks you speak of.</blockquote>
      <p>James Gunn set the record straight while he was answering questions on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesgunn/?hl=en">Instagram</a> Stories feed, so if anyone tells you that he and Mark Hamill have been having conversations about the latter leaving his mark on a different cosmic film franchise, they’re wrong. Now granted, maybe things could change in the future and Hamill could enter into official conversations about taking part in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>, but it’s unlikely.</p>
      <p>The talk of Mark Hamill potentially appearing in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i> began in late February 2018. After a fan asked if Gunn could find Hamill a role in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>, Gunn noted how he and Hamill live close to one another and could easily <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2316852/looks-like-mark-hamill-may-have-landed-a-role-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3">“talk about it over a cup of coffee,”</a> which Hamill was game for. Now obviously that in no ways constitutes a binding agreement, but it nonetheless got some <i>Guardians</i> fans excited.</p>
      <p>However, in June 2018, just one month before Disney and Marvel fired James Gunn from the project (he was reinstated last March), Mark Hamill reversed course and said <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2443689/why-mark-hamill-doesnt-want-a-role-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-franchise">he didn’t want a role in the <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> franchise</a>. While he likes these movies, he prefers seeing them as an audience member, the same reason why he liked the <i>Star Wars</i> spinoffs <i>Rogue One</i> and <i>Solo</i>.</p>
      <p>So unless Mark Hamill changes his mind, don’t expect to see him popping his head into <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>. However, that doesn’t mean we won’t ever see Hamill in the wider MCU. Maybe there’s a spot for him in <i>Captain Marvel 2</i> or <i>Ant-Man 3</i>, or maybe he could take part in either of the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476881/kevin-feige-hints-marvel-phase-5-will-bring-in-x-men-and-fantastic-four">forthcoming Fantastic Four or X-Men reboots</a>. Anything’s possible.</p>
      <p>When we last left off with the Guardians of the Galaxy in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, they’d left Earth with Thor to search for <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483142/avengers-endgame-writers-address-reviving-gamora-for-guardians-3">the time-displaced Gamora</a>. Since the God of Thunder is returning for <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i> in late 2021, we can assume he’s left the Guardians’ company by then, and there’s still no word on what’s in store for their next adventure. One strong possibility is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481415/zac-efron-as-adam-warlock-marvel-fan-adds-him-to-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-poster">that it will involve Adam Warlock</a>, who was teased at the end of <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i> doesn’t have an assigned release date yet, so stay tuned to CinemaBlend for that information and any other updates on how the threequel is coming along. Don’t forget to look through our <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/upcoming-marvel-movies-release-dates-for-phase-4-and-5-67944.html">comprehensive guide</a> on what else the MCU has lined up for Phase 4 and beyond.</p>
      <p>As for Mark Hamill, he can be seen reprising Luke Skywalker in <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> on December 20.</p>
