      <p>Evil sex offender Kel Hinchley (Joseph Alessi) is about to have his true colours exposed as Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) bravely speaks out about the abuse he suffered at his hands as a teenager in Coronation Street – but as he faces going behind bars, he snaps and takes Bernie Winter (Jane Hazlegrove) hostage in tense scenes.</p>
      <p>With Gemma (Dolly Rose Campbell) having discovered the truth about Kel, she shares Paul’s brave revelation with Chesney Brown (Sam Aston), who is traumatised at the thought that Kel had been spending time with Joseph.</p>
      <p>Before long, the police turn up and arrest Kel for the recent burglaries but Bernie adds in the report of child sexual abuse, much to Paul’s horror. He feels unable to speak out to the police about what happened to him but Bernie attempts to persuade him that he is strong enough to face him.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Kel is interviewed and presented with the incriminating photographs found at his flat. Knowing that Bernie is behind the report, he seethes and vows revenge. Released on bail, Kel heads round to confront Bernie and grabs the house keys, locking her in with him and holding her hostage.</p>

      <p>As she is terrified of what he might do, Gemma and Paul rush to the rescue and this helps embolden Paul to consider making a police statement against the man who destroyed his childhood.</p>
      <p>Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank) is broud of Paul for taking the step and arranges for him to speak to a counsellor at a sexual abuse charity. He is anxious but manages to speak about what happened to him.</p>

      <p>As the discussion continues, he is made to see that none of this was his fault and Kel no longer feels like a helpless victim and is ready to fight the fight to ensure that Kel faces justice.</p>
      <p>Is this the end of the line for the abuser?</p>
