          <b> Zimbabwean CLOCKS 350km/hr with Audi RS</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>This unidentified Zimbabwean ‘speed demon’ recorded himself clocking 350km/hr with an Audi RS, while blasting Reverend T Chivaviro’s Tariro Yangu.</p>
      <p>One word, exhilarating!</p>
      <p>The driver seems to have performed the daring stunt on the popular German autobahn which generally doesn’t have speed limits, somewhere near the city of Stuttgart.</p>
      <p>We are just not sure which ‘home’  he was missing at that particular moment, <a href="https://iharare.com/100-most-influential-zimbabweans-under-40/">Zimbabwe</a> or the heavens by driving at such adrenaline-pumping speeds.</p>
      <p>The Audi RS which suffered his merciless accelerations is from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S_and_RS_models#:~:targetText=Audi%20Sport%20GmbH%20(formerly%20quattro,translated%20as%20%22racing%20sport%22.">family of high-performance range versions</a> manufactured by the German automotive company AUDI AG, a member of the Volkswagen Group.</p>
