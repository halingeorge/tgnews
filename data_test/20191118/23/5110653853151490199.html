      <h1>Bears' Matt Nagy insists Mitchell Trubisky benching had 'zero to do with his play'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:38:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:38</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Spratt</a></address>
      <p>Matt Nagy echoed his postgame sentiment that Mitch Trubisky had not been pulled for a poor performance as he faced the media on Monday, insisting only a nagging hip injuryled to the Bears quarterback's removalfrom Sunday's loss to the Rams.</p>
      <p>Trubisky endured a torrid outing —completing 24 of his 43 passes for just 190 yards, with one touchdown and one interception —in the 17-7 loss.</p>
      <p>The quarterback <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mitchell-trubisky-benched-bears-hip-injury/1xu2qo1htvntt19r9awiph4v0u">was benched late in the game</a>, allowing Chase Daniel to take to the field, andthe Bears posted on Twitter their starter was dealing with a hip problem.</p>

      <p>Nagy expanded on the issue Monday, claiming it was evident Trubisky was suffering from a hip problem picked up in a sack late in the first half. When it was put to the head coach there had been scepticism about the nature of Trubisky's absence late in the game, he replied: "I'm aware from others, who have told me that."</p>
      <p>"After the game, when you're interviewing, there's a lot of stuff going on. This one's so simple —there's nothing but honesty," he said. "Every decision that was made had zero to do with his play. It was based off the injury he had last night.</p>

      <p>"When you're not a part of it and you don't really know what's going on, I'm not questioning what people are thinking. I'm just telling you exactly what happened. I can't be more honest than that. We knew there was pain and we had to monitor that the entire second half. You'll see it when you watch the tape, on almost every play, you'll see where it's affecting him."</p>
      <p>Nagy added the injury had started to affect the success of the team, although the quarterback was keen to continue regardless.</p>
      <p>"He really wanted to [play]," Nagy said. "Sometimes I have to protect him from himself. That's exactly what that was."</p>
