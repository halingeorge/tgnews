      <p><b>HARRISBURG, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - Gov. Tom Wolf will sign legislation allowing hunting on three Sundays a year in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>The Senate voted 38-11 on Wednesday, the bill's last hurdle before it heads to Wolf's desk.</p>
      <p>The bill permits Sunday hunting one day during rifle deer season, one during statewide archery deer season and a third day the Game Commission selects.</p>
      <p>It also requires a landowner's written permission and makes it easier for wardens to enforce the anti-trespassing law. The long-fought issue overcame opposition from farmers and outdoors groups.</p>
      <p>Pennsylvania has banned Sunday hunting since the 19th century, although there are currently exceptions for crows, foxes and coyotes, and for noncommercial private game reserves.</p>
      <p>The bill is touted as a way to make it easier for younger people and those who work during the week to hunt.</p>
