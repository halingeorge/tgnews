      <p>With Irish music superstars set to rock Adelaide Oval tonight, we’re asking you to share your favourite live music memories. SHARE YOURS HERE.</p>
      <p>It might sound like a piece of worthless rubbish to you, but it means a lot to me, because one glorious afternoon in 2006, Meg White, the shy and enigmatic drummer for the White Stripes, held that very stick in her grasp as she crashed and bashed her way around her distinctive red and white drum kit during a brilliant set at The Big Day Out.</p>
      <p>Then, as now, The White Stripes were one of my favourite bands of all time.</p>
      <p>That explains my interest in the object, but how did I end up with only half a stick?</p>
      <p>It went down like this.</p>
      <p>At the end of the show, as many drummers do, White began tossing a few sticks out into the crowd - a small memento for any fan lucky enough to secure one.</p>
      <p>

      <p>As one stick went flying through the air, my friend Scott, who had positioned himself much closer to the stage than I, and who knew well the depths of my obsession with the band, did what any good friend would do and reached out a hand to grab it.</p>
      <p>And he did – trouble was, while he had managed to take a firm grip on one end of the stick, the gentleman next to him had managed to take hold of the other end of it , and in that moment, both decided they wouldn’t be letting go.</p>
      <p>We might call it a sticking point.</p>
      <p>After a vigorous struggle for the prize, and the impasse not about to be resolved without decisive action, Scott cooly snapped the stick over his leg, gave the other fellow his share and presented me with the bottom half, which I reasoned was the better half anyway, because Meg herself had touched it.</p>
      <p>In that way, Scott didn’t just give me half a drum stick, but a tangible reminder of one of the best gigs I ever saw in Adelaide.</p>
      <p>He gave me a story.</p>
      <p>And I’m reminded of it any time I look at that jagged broken stick with the waxy red handle that might look like rubbish to anyone else but which is a treasure to me.</p>
