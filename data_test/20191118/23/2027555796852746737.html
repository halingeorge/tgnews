      <h1>Three dead in Oklahoma Walmart shooting: US media</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:23:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Three people were killed in a shooting early Monday at a Walmart store in Duncan, Oklahoma, local media reported citing the state's highway patrol and local police.</p>
      <p>According to TNN television, Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said the shooting took place in a parking lot in front of the store and the suspect is one of those killed.</p>
      <p>Schools in the area had been placed on lockdown temporarily before being given an "all clear" by local police, according to a Facebook statement from Duncan Public Schools.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place shortly before 10:00 am on Monday, police said. They said two men and a woman died in the incident.</p>
      <p>A gunman killed 22 people in a Walmart store in August in El Paso Texas, while another Walmart store in Mississippi was the scene of a shooting in July, when a disgruntled employee killed two co-workers and wounded a police officer.</p>
      <p>In the El Paso shooting, a 21-year-old gunman said he had launched the deadly attack in response to what he called a "Hispanic invasion" of Texas.</p>
      <p>Walmart said in the wake of the two shootings inside its stores within a week of each other that it would limit sales of guns and ammunition.</p>
      <p>Police in Fresno, California, said that four people were shot dead and six others wounded on Sunday during a shooting at a gathering in a backyard to watch a football game.</p>
