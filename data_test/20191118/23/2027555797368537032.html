      <h1>Revenue scam: Two stamp vendors held, many fear arrest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:35:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/umesh-r-yadav" target="_blank">Umesh R Yadav</a></address>
      <p>The Central Crime Branch (CCB) has arrested two stamp paper vendors for allegedly helping sub-registrars register revenue sites to private parties and manipulating the software used for property registration.</p>
      <p>R Rangaswamy (49), a resident of Peenya, and Keshava (39), a resident of T Sadarahalli, are the arrested suspects. They both are stamp paper vendors at Laggere and Dasanapura sub-registrar offices.</p>
      <p>A senior police officer said the duo was working as middlemen. They would help the sub-registrars in identifying agriculture land under the green zone, buying them from farmers and converting and developing them as layouts, and selling the layouts to private parties.</p>
      <p>CCB officials questioned seven sub-registrars on Monday, and they would be summoned again for further interrogation.</p>
      <p>It is learnt that after sub-registrars had obtained anticipatory bail, more staffers, including data entry operators, engineers and other sub-registrars, have applied for anticipatory bail fearing arrest.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that nearly 50 government officials are involved in this scam.</p>
      <p>A special team has been sent to Pune to gather details about the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) software.</p>
      <p>After they return, more information would be gathered on the scam, said a senior police officer.</p>
