      <p>Valve will officially return to the Half-Life series with a new episode designed for virtual reality called <i>Half-Life</i><i>: Alyx. </i>The full reveal for the “flagship VR game” will happen later this week, the company announced today.</p>

      <p>The title of that VR-exclusive game draws its name, of course, from Alyx Vance, Gordon Freeman’s co-star in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/half-life-2/1181"><i>Half-Life 2</i></a> and its two add-on episodes. The last time we saw Alyx, she was mourning the death of her father Eli at the conclusion of <i>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</i>. It’s not clear if <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will clear up what happened after that cliffhanger, which Half-Life fans have been reeling from since 2007.</p>
      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>’s reveal, which will unfold on Thursday, coincides with the 21-year anniversary of the original <i>Half-Life</i>’s release on PC, and a little over 15 years after the release of <i>Half-Life 2</i>.</p>
      <p>Valve did not reveal a release date or gameplay details. If the announcement of a new Half-Life game seems somewhat unceremonious, it may be because the existence of <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> leaked ahead of Valve’s Twitter teaser. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rumour-valve-are-about-to-announce-a-vr-game-called-half-life-alyx/">PC Gamer reported</a> on Monday that a leaked interview between The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley and members of Valve pegged <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> for a March 2020 release date.</p>
