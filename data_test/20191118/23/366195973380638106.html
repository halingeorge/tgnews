      <p>It feels as if it's been a minute since we've heard new music from Fizz, but the B2K singer has returned with a single, "Mirror." <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/moniece-slaughter-vows-to-channel-omarions-silent-energy-in-lil-fizz-and-apryl-jones-drama-news.95455.html">The <i>Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood </i>star has been taking a few TKOs in the media</a> as the news of his relationship with Apryl Jones, the ex-girlfriend and mother to B2K bandmate <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Omarion/profile">Omarion</a>'s kids, has been circulating. However, Fizz wants people to know that his music is more important than the gossip that he can't seem to shake.</p>
      <p>The single "Mirror" comes with an accompanying music video that features a dimly lit strip club venue with half-naked women who are more than happy to shake it fast. The song doesn't have any surprises, elevations, or turns;<a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/apryl-jones-claps-back-at-meek-mill-after-he-calls-out-her-and-fizz-relationship-news.95398.html"> it's a straightforward beat with a straightforward delivery</a> by Fizz. The reactions from Fizz fans have been a mixed bag, so give "Mirror" a spin and let us know if Fizz has a hit on his hands.</p>
