      <p>Willian wants to renew his contract at Stamford Bridge despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fc-barcelona/">Barcelona</a> plotting a fresh move for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> star.</p>
      <p>Brazilian winger Willian has made more than 300 appearances for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> giants Chelsea since signing from Anzhi Makhachkala in 2013.</p>
      <p>Helping the Blues win two Premier League titles, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/europa-league/">Europa League</a>, FA Cup and EFL Cup, Willian has enjoyed substantial success in west London.</p>

      <p>With his current contract set to expire next summer, the 31-year-old will be free to talk to other clubs in January and Barcelona are monitoring his situation.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-in-talks-to-extend-willians-deal-despite-barcelona/dccm0n9a83l01nj0a8fl1pgp6">Goal</a> say the experienced winger is keen to extend his stay at Chelsea, particularly as he is enjoying a revival under club legend Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Willian has featured in all but one of Chelsea’s Premier League matches so far this season and Lampard admits he wants the Brazilian to put pen to paper on a contract extension.</p>

      <p>‘The word isn’t ‘no-brainer’ because I can’t get involved in the money, that’s up to the club to do,’ Lampard said earlier in the month.</p>
      <p>‘But everyone sees how much I’m relying on him and what he’s producing. I love him at this football club, so there’s my answer.’</p>
      <p>Willian, meanwhile, recently revealed that he had the chance to sign for Barcelona last year.</p>

      <p>He told DAZN: ‘The only real offer I had to leave Chelsea came from Barcelona last year, after the World Cup. Barca presented an offer to Chelsea but it was rejected.</p>
      <p>‘That was the only time I ever had to discuss something like that with my family, but we really love it here [in London]. So there were several factors that helped me stay.’</p>
      <p>Chelsea, who are currently third in the Premier League, travel to defending champions Manchester City on Saturday.</p>
