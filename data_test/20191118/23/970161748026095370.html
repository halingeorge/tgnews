      <p>Roy Cropper (David Neilson) always means well but his best efforts only make things worse as he tries to step up for dying brother Richard and his daughter Nina in Coronation Street this week. But the kindly cafe owner is not giving up on being there from them in their hour of need – and soon he leaves Carla Connor (Alison King) stunned with a bold decision for the future.</p>
      <p>Roy has only just found out that Richard even existed and so was left shocked to learn that he is terminally ill after meeting him. Nina is his carer and as Richard throws himself into getting to know Roy, she is dismayed as he fatigues himself and starts to take a turn for the worse.</p>
      <p>Nina blames Roy for Richard’s setback and as he tries to help, she stubbornly refuses his efforts, saying that she has everything in hand.</p>

      <p>And when she goes to move an air condenser herself, she ends up getting hurt, which makes Roy feel even worse.</p>

      <p>As he talks to Carla about the situation later, he confides in his best friend that he plans to take Nina in once Richard dies as she had nowhere else to go. But will Nina be willing to accept such a gesture?</p>

      <p>Later, Roy heads round again and with Richard getting worse, he insists on taking over his care and realises how much of a burden it must be for Nina to be his full time carer. Roy insists to adult social services that Richard is re-assessed but when he interferes too much and has a go at the carer for being late, Nina is furious with him when the carer quits his job!</p>
      <p>As Roy feels bad that he is only making things worse, he announces to Richard that he will take over his full time care – but will Nina agree to having Roy so involved?</p>
