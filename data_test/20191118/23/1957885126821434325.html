      <h1>Amy Hennig joins Skydance Media to create "new story-focused experiences"</h1>
      <h2>On "emerging streaming platforms".</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:42:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:42</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Wales</a></address>
      <p>Amy Hennig is joining Skydance Media, the Hollywood studio behind the likes of Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Terminator: Dark Fate, to establish a division that will work on "new story-focused experiences".</p>
      <p>Hennig, perhaps best known for her work as writer and director on Naughty Dog's first three Uncharted games, will, alongside executive producer partner Julian Beak, be tasked with building a new team for Skydance, located in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
      <p>The studio's goal is to create "new story-focused experiences [that] will employ state-of-the-art computer graphics to provide the visual fidelity of television and film, but with an active, lean-in experience that puts the audience in the driver's seat".</p>
      <p>Skydance says these experiences will be "crafted as an interactive series" and will be aimed "gamers and non-gamers...on emerging streaming platforms".</p>

      <p>"Our goal is to create inviting and innovative experiences with the high production values and visual fidelity that will set the standard in this new media landscape", said Hennig, who, according to her <a href="https://twitter.com/amy_hennig">Twitter bio</a>, is now officially President, New Media Division, Skydance Media.</p>
      <p>Today's announcement marks Hennig's first high-profile appointment since joining EA in 2014 to lead work on a top secret Star Wars project, codenamed Ragtag, in development at Visceral Games. Hennig made the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-28-uncharted-creator-amy-hennig-has-departed-ea-to-set-up-indie-studio">leave the publisher</a> shortly after it shut down Visceral to "pivot" the direction of the game in October 2017.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Eurogamer earlier this year, Hennig <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-16-the-big-amy-hennig-interview">shared her thoughts</a> on the rise of streaming platforms and what that might mean for the future of gaming. It's well worth a read and could, given Skydance's stated interest in "emerging streaming platforms", offer a clue as to the kind of experiences Hennig might be considering next in her new role.</p>
