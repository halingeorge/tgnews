      <p>It was after she praised “Big Bang Theory” that Barber revealed she almost hit Bialik with her car.</p>
      <p>“They were our neighbours too, just across stage 25,” Barber shared. “We had different taping schedules. I almost ran over Mayim Bialik one time and I’m dying to meet her and apologize.”</p>
