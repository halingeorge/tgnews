      <h1>Well God Damn, Linda Marigliano &amp; Gen Fricker Are Leaving Triple J As Well</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:07:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:07</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>In what’s turning out to be a pretty significant presenter shake up, Triple J has this morning confirmed both <b>Linda Marigliano </b>and <b>Gen Fricker </b>will be leaving the broadcaster, wrapping up significantly tenured careers in the hallowed halls of Aunty.</p>
      <p>This morning’s announcement follows on from yesterday’s confirmation that <i>Hack </i>host <b>Tom Tilley </b>would also be moving away from Triple J, taking up an expanded hosting and reporting role on Channel Ten’s <i>The Project</i>.</p>
      <p>Marigliano in particular is a big loss for the network, having been a mainstay on Triple J airwaves for the past decade. Initially starting out on the <i>Lunch </i>and <i>Drive </i>shifts, the latter alongside <b>Scott Dooley</b>, Marigliano was a key figure in the creation and launch of the hugely beloved <i>Good Nights </i>program, which she anchored consistently up until 2018, when she took over for the departing <b>Zan Rowe </b>on <i>Triple J Mornings</i>.</p>

      <p>In a statement issued by Triple J officials this morning, Marigliano said that she feels “overwhelmed with joy and genuine love for this station that has been my family for so many years.”</p>
      <p>“It’s more than music, it’s a real connection with the people around us. It’s an identity that we are lucky enough to be a part of with every single show, with every record that excites us and with every listener that calls up, shares stories and makes me laugh like a maniac because they feel like my best friend. Thank you for having me. It’s been f**king beautiful,” she said.</p>
      <p>Fricker, on the other hand, joined Triple J five years ago as a solo presenter, before anchoring <i>Weekend Arvos </i>with <b>Kyran Wheatley</b> for a number of years, eventually shifting across to the permanent weekday <i>Lunch </i>shift. Fricker also spent various stints as a fill-in host on both <i>Drive </i>with <b>Lewis Hobba </b>and on the <i>Breakfast </i>shift as well.</p>
      <p>Fricker stated that she was “honoured to have spent the last five years talking absolute garbage with some of my best friends, favourite artists, and the greatest listeners in the world.” She said “It breaks my heart to leave, but I will be forever grateful for the chance to be a (small) part of such an iconic institution. To everyone who’s tuned in, texted or just enjoyed my general dickheadedry: thank you.”</p>
      <p>Fricker will focus her efforts on her growing stand-up comedy career. It’s unclear where Marigliano will land post-Triple J at this stage.</p>
      <p>Triple J officials are set to announce a full, and very new, roster of on-air presenters for 2020 and beyond tomorrow.</p>
