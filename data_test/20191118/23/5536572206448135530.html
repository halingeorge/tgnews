      <p>Danny Green did something on Sunday night that many NBA fans just aren’t used to as he skied high for a put-back dunk in Sunday’s win over the Atlanta Hawks.</p>
      <p>That dunk was so crazy and athletic that the league thought something might be going on, so they sent a random test his way.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles Lakers veteran took to Twitter to announce he had been drug tested.</p>

      <p>To be fair, that was a pretty monstrous dunk for a 32-year-old.</p>
