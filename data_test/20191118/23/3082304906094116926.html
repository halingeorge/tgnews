      </p>
      <p>Switzerland booked their spot at Euro 2020 after cruising to a 6-1 win over Gibraltar at Victoria Stadium on Monday.</p>
      <p>Their nervy 1-0 win over Georgia on Friday kept them top of Group D ahead of the final round of fixtures and they never looked in danger of relinquishing that position with a dominant display.</p>
      <p>Cedric Itten – who scored the winner against Georgia – set them on their way after 10 minutes, with Ruben Vargas and Christian Fassnacht adding further goals after the interval.</p>
      <p>The hosts pulled one back through Reece Styche in the 74th minute – just their third goal of the qualifying campaign – but Switzerland reasserted their superiority through Loris Benito, a second goal from Itten and a late strike from Granit Xhaka.</p>
      <p>The result meant Vladimir Petkovic’s side finished top of Group D on 17 points – one point ahead of Denmark, who also qualified for next year’s tournament after a 1-1 draw with Republic of Ireland.</p>
