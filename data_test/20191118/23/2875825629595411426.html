      <h2>I'm a Celeb camp mates gets one luxury item each, and Adele's is a framed photo of her favourite Loose Women</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:10:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:10</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> viewers were confused to say the least at Adele Roberts' luxury item.</p>
      <p>The camp mates are all allowed one luxury item each, which tends to be something like a family photo, make up, or a pillow.</p>
      <p>And during a Bushtucker trial in tonight's episode, the camp mates tried to win the items for their peers.</p>
      <p>Everyone in the main camp's luxury item was boxed, while <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kate-garraway">Kate Garraway</a> , Adele Roberts, Roman Kemp and Myles Stephenson had to pass them down a line to each other using oars, and drop them into the box.</p>
      <p>They failed miserably and only managed to win Kate and Adele's items.</p>

      <p>They lost other campmates items including Miles' camera and James orthopedic cushion.</p>
      <p>But Adele got her luxury item, which was a framed photo of Loose Women's Jane McDonald.</p>
      <p>When she opened it up in the camp, her campmates were baffled as to why she chose that out of any luxury option, while Adele encouraged everyone to give the photo a "lucky rub".</p>

      <p>And they weren't the only ones who were confused.</p>
      <p>Viewers took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to virtually eye-roll at Adele's gag.</p>
      <p>"Adele decided to have a framed pic of Jane McDonald as her luxury item because she thought it’d make her the hilarious ledge of the series.... cringe", said one.</p>

      <p>"Imagine when james is told that he didn’t get his special neck cushion but Adele got a photo of Jane McDonald????", ranted another.</p>
      <p>"Can you imagine being in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> and not everyone wins their luxury item and you hope the people who did will share theirs or even be useful to camp in some way..</p>
      <p>"Then Adele opens hers and it’s a photo of Jane McDonald.. ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS", said another.</p>
