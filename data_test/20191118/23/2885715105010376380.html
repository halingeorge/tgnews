      <h1>Delhi colony regularisation bill not on winter session list, Kejriwal lashes out</h1>
      <h2>“We have always said their (Centre) intent is suspect,” the Delhi CM said, recounting that the Delhi government Cabinet had passed the proposal to regularise the colonies and sent it to the Union government in November 2015.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:55:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Claiming that the bill for regularisation of unauthorised colonies in the capital does not figure in the list of proposed legislations to be introduced in the Winter Session of Parliament, Delhi Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a> hit out at the Centre and said the AAP will launch a mass movement on the continued uncertainty over the issue.</p>
      <p>“We have always said their (Centre) intent is suspect,” the CM said, recounting that the Delhi government Cabinet had passed the proposal to regularise the colonies and sent it to the Union government in November 2015.</p>
      <p>AAP, in a statement, also attacked <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> over its “falsehoods” on the matter. The issue has been a political hot potato in Delhi politics, more so after the Centre approved regularisation of 1,728 unauthorised colonies last month.</p>
      <p>Kejriwal also questioned the Centre’s insistence over the last four years that boundaries of the colonies cannot be delineated based on satellite images alone, and that a Total Station Mapping survey method be adopted.</p>
      <p>“Incidentally, they have now accepted the use of satellite maps… Just before the Assembly polls, they announced the regularisation process. Not listing it in the government’s agenda for the Winter Session only exposes their true intention,” he said.</p>
      <p>Urging people not to believe anyone till they get registration papers of their properties, Kejriwal said, “There will be a mass movement for this now. We will take it up in the Parliament, on the streets, wherever required.”</p>
