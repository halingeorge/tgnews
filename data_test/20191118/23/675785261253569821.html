      <h2>The Love Island stars have taken a huge step in their relationship after just three months of dating</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:33:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:33</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wes-nelson">Wes Nelson</a> and Arabella Chi have taken their relationship to a new level, moving in together after just three months of dating.</p>
      <p>The couple took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to show off their new love nest as they unpacked their household appliances and unpacked their boxes.</p>
      <p>Wes, 21, who took part in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> in 2018, and 29-year-old Arabella, who starred in the 2019 series, are officially cohabitating just three months into their romance.</p>
      <p>Their new flat is lightly-furnished so far but it's early days.</p>
      <p>They've just started moving in their boxes, filling up their wardrobes and stocking up their kitchen.</p>
      <p>Wes cracked open a beer as he booted up his laptop and stuck some music on.</p>

      <p>The lovers' flat features sleek wooden floors and marble kitchen countertops, as well as built-in wadrobes for a super tidy design layout.</p>
      <p>As they gave fans a tour of their new place, Wes pointed out his favourite item - a spice rack.</p>
      <p>He joked it would be Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae's worse nightmare after people recently poked fun at them over their plain-looking meal.</p>
      <p>Wes laughed: "Here is the kitchen set-up at the minute. Some nice little bits that we got today and this in particular, I imagine is Tommy and Molly's worst nightmare."</p>

      <p>So far the kitchen counters are stocked with bottles of champagne and gin, a water filter, a kettle and toaster, and some other bits and bobs.</p>
      <p>The hallway is almost empty for the minute, with just a small grey table with a lamp sat on top.</p>
      <p>Other rooms are piled high with boxes waiting to be unpacked by the lovebirds.</p>

      <p>During a shopping trip, Wes said he'd be documenting the move-in for fans, and encouraged people to offer suggestions about their furnishings.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are gonna blog the whole move in and we want you to help designing the apartment."</p>
      <p>The move comes after the couple opened up about their age gap, saying it doesn't mean a thing to them.</p>

      <p>Wes told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/">OK! magazine</a> : "People tell me I act way older than my age. I'm very mature, and Arabella is the immature one."</p>
      <p>Arabella added: "People always think I'm 21 because I don't look, or act my age. Wes has had a lot of life experience because he's been on Love Island and has done a lot, so he has been fast tracked."</p>
