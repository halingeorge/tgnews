      <h1>LSU Defense Receives A Major Boost On Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:01:58+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>LSU’s defense has had plenty of problems this season. One thing’s for sure – this isn’t the Tigers’ defense of old.</p>
      <p>Coach O’s team allowed 37 points to Ole Miss on Saturday. Due to the Tigers’ elite offensive attack, the big point total wasn’t an issue in regards to the outcome of the game. But there’s legitimate concerns about Ed Orgeron’s squad when facing a good offense, like Clemson or Ohio State.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fortunately for the Tigers, they received a major boost on the defensive side of the ball on Monday. Linebacker Michael Divinity – who left the team due to personal reasons in the week leading up to the Alabama game – has rejoined the team and is now listed on the official roster.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/247Sports/status/1196557209401995278">247Sports</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if he’ll play this Saturday for the Tigers against Arkansas. But it’s certainly a major re-addition for a defense needing more play-makers. Prior to his departure, Divinity led the team with three sacks. He also added 23 tackles in games prior to his leave.</p>

      <p>The LSU linebacker’s return makes sense given his message announcing he was taking a leave of absence.</p>
      <blockquote>“My goal is to get myself back to 100% in time to graduate in December and be back on the field fighting with my brothers soon.”</blockquote>
      <p>It looks like Divinity was able to get things sorted out. It’s certainly a major addition for the LSU defense.</p>
