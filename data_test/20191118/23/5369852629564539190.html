      <p> DENMARK MANAGER AGE Hareide admitted his side scantly deserved the 1-1 draw in Dublin that has seen them qualify for the 2020 European Championships. </p>
      <p>“We didn’t play well at all”, the outgoing manager told his post-match press conference. </p>
      <p>“I don’t know what happened. Solid defensive play saw us through the first half. We got in front in the second half and eased off in terms of pressure.” </p>
      <p>As Ireland piled on the pressure in the frantic finale after Matt Doherty’s late equaliser, Hareide bemoaned his side’s poor counter-attacking play.</p>
      <p>“At the end after they scored they put a lot of pressure on us. It’s difficult because they had to throw a lot of people forward. We defended with the same amount of people, we filled up the box, and we have to gamble to get the counter-attacks.</p>
      <p>“Today we didn’t put the counter-attacks together in the way we wanted. We didn’t play well and are lucky to get away with a draw.” </p>
      <p>He did reserve further praise for Ireland, saying that a similar performance should be enough for Mick McCarthy’s side to navigate the Uefa Nations League play-offs. Ireland’s semi-final play-off opponents will be determined by Friday’s draw, with Wales, Bosnia and Slovakia potential opponents. </p>
      <p>“Ireland played well and if they keep going like that they will probably come through the Nations League play-offs and qualify.” </p>

      <p>Hareide also paid tribute to the Irish fans at a crammed Aviva Stadium.</p>
      <p>“It’s a fantastic place to play, Dublin. With the fans and the songs and the enthusiasm. I feel at home in Dublin!”</p>
      <p>He didn’t confirm he feels at home in the place because his side are so frequently drawn to play here. Nonetheless, he leaves it behind to move on to the Euros. </p>
      <p>Ireland, however, have a serious amount of work on their hands to join them. </p>
