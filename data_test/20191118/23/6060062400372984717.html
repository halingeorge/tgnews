      <p>The Houston Astros have been under fire for using an outfield camera, computer screens, garbage cans, and baseball bats to steal signs throughout their World Series-winning 2017 MLB season.</p>
      <p>But until now, it was unclear whether or not the team's illicit activities extended into the postseason.</p>
      <p>Resurfaced videos from the 2017 World Series appear to show the work station in Houston's locker room tunnel that players and coaches used to tip off Astros batters as to which pitches to expect from their opponents.</p>
      <p>According to reporting from <a href="https://theathletic.com/1363451/2019/11/12/the-astros-stole-signs-electronically-in-2017-part-of-a-much-broader-issue-for-major-league-baseball/?source=spotrac&amp;pc=spotrac40off">The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich</a>, Houston used an outfield camera to relay catcher signs screens near the dugout. Players and coaches in the tunnel just off of the dugout would look to identify the catcher's signals before banging on garbage cans with baseball bats to signify the pitch.</p>
      <p>A video of Carlos Correa leaving the Astros tunnel prior to Game 5 of the 2017 World Series shows the Houston shortstop walking directly past a table of monitors situated next to a garbage can.</p>

      <p>Another video shows various Astros players and coaches walking past the screens on the table after the game. Sunflower seeds and other pieces of garbage litter the floor, indicating that team members had spent extended time in the area.</p>

      <p>The MLB is looking into claims regarding Houston's sign stealing, but it remains unclear whether or not the league has independently found evidence of cheating during the 2017 postseason in its investigation.</p>
