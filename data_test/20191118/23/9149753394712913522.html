      <h1>Valve confirms Half-Life: Alyx, full reveal coming later this week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:19:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jody-macgregor/" target="_blank">Jody Macgregor</a></address>
      <p><b>Update 2: </b>It's official, Half-Life: Alyx is happening. Valve's long-awaited "flagship VR game" will be revealed to the world at 10 am PT/1 pm ET on November 21. The tweet comes from a relatively new account—created June 2019—with a small number of followers, and this is actually its first tweet. It's also odd that Valve would make such a big announcement over a channel that so few people were paying attention to. The official <a href="https://twitter.com/steam_games">Steam Twitter feed</a>, to compare, has 5.2 million followers. </p>
      <p>But it's verified, and the tweet has been retweeted by a few Valve folks, so we're confident it's legit: A new communications channel for a "new" kind of Valve, maybe.</p>
      <p>We'll keep you posted. </p>

      <p><b>Update:</b> According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7Dke__WLzyTzDg1omSrSzy5alzbUhsC8kZZ8anAhqk/edit">a new transcript of the leaked interview</a>, Half-Life: Alyx will be shown at The Game Awards on December 12.</p>
      <p><b>Original story:</b> This November 19 will mark the 21st anniversary of the release of the original Half-Life, and according to rumor it will also be when Valve announce a flagship virtual reality game called Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
      <p>Valve are rarely interested in celebrating their own game's anniversaries, so take this rumor with a mouthful of salt. The source is apparently the same leaker responsible for the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/dota-underlords-early-access-footage-leaked/">DOTA Underlords leak</a>, and is quoting from <a href="https://pastebin.com/9rjrw8nC">an interview</a> between "Geoff" (Geoff Keighley, in his capacity as the creator of the "Final Hours" documentaries about Valve games), Robin Walker (co-developer of Team Fortress 2 among other games), and an unnamed third person.</p>
      <p>"March 2020, "Half-Life: Alyx" comin' out", says Geoff in the transcript.</p>
      <p>Responding to the question of whether this game would be available for players without VR headsets, "I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard, but like as we said, it began as an exploration of VR," an unnamed person replies.</p>
      <p>As for how this entirely hypothetical game would play, the only clue is this statement: "You can see their whole body-- Respond to the situation. You know, panicking, dropping clips on the ground as they fumble their weapons 'cause a zombie's in front of them, all these things, they're just - it's been really fun watching playtests."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-vr-game/">Valve have said they'll be releasing a "flagship VR game" this year</a>.</p>
      <p>I've reached out to Valve for comment and will update this story if they reply.</p>
