      <h1>Accused bike-path terrorist Sayfullo Saipov tells judge he only answers to Allah</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:56:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:56</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Saul</a></address>
      <p>Accused bike path terrorist Sayfullo Saipov told a Manhattan federal court judge Monday he doesn’t respect his authority — while prosecutors said they want to empanel an anonymous jury to <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/28/feds-will-seek-death-penalty-for-alleged-bike-path-terrorist/">oversee the death penalty case.</a></p>
      <p>“The orders issued here have nothing to do with me,” Saipov told Judge Vernon Broderick through an Uzbek interpreter. “I am following orders of Allah, who gave me life.”</p>
      <p>The comments followed a hearing regarding jury selection ahead of the alleged ISIS militant’s trial for driving a truck down a crowded bike path on Halloween 2017, <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/31/8-killed-truck-pedestrians-downtown-nyc-terror-attack/">killing eight people.</a></p>
      <p>Saipov stood as he spoke, wildly gesticulating as he asked Broderick why he was sitting in judgement of him “for the eight people killed” and “not those who are killing thousands and millions of Muslims over the world.”</p>
      <p>Broderick eventually cut off the 31-year-old, and told him a judge’s role was more like that of a “referee.”</p>
      <p>“I recognize that you don’t recognize me, or recognize my authority,” Broderick added. “This isn’t the time or place to be making statements.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Manhattan federal prosecutor Matthew Laroche said the government plans to seek an anonymous jury to sit on the case.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney David Patton said his team would be opposing that request.</p>
      <p>Broderick has yet to rule on the issue.</p>
      <p>Saipov’s trial is scheduled to kick off April 13, 2020.</p>
