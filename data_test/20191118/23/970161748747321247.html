        <b>Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) has been going to some pretty dark places in EastEnders as of late, but in the coming episodes, he seemingly attempts to change his ways, as he makes a big gesture.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an attempt to acquire the wrench Stacey (Lacey Turner) used to bludgeon Phil (Steve McFadden), Martin carried out Ben’s dirty work. However, Ben refused to let him go — even after he’d handed over said wrench — and blackmailed Martin once more, threatening to turn him over to the police for car theft.</p>
      <p>Martin made several attempts to get out — and he even had Ben arrested — but Ben refused to budge, and even <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/eastenders-spoilers-shocking-scenes-as-ben-mitchell-goes-to-extreme-lengths-to-get-revenge-on-martin-fowler-after-his-betrayal-10981669/">hung from the railway bridge</a> in an attempt to show him who’s boss.</p>
      <p>Martin’s life was hell, but when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/eastenders-spoilers-kathy-beale-violently-slaps-ben-mitchell-as-he-threatens-martin-fowlers-children-11177187/">Kathy found out what Ben was up to</a>, she scolded her son for being so cruel, and warned him to change his ways before it was too late.</p>

      <p>Yes, Ben’s demonstrated a much darker side to his personality in recent months — and it’s a side that both Kathy and Callum haven’t been to keen on, that’s for sure.</p>
      <p>However, it seems as thought the young man could be about to start making up for at least some of the heartache he’s caused, as — in the coming episodes — he manages to help Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), and finds himself in rather high spirits as a result!</p>
      <p>Viewers will remember that — during Hunter’s (Charlie Winter) siege — it was Sonia who saved Ben after he’d been shot, so perhaps he feels obliged to offer his support as a result?</p>
      <p>Has Ben really turned over a new leaf? What’s more, is he even capable of doing so?</p>
