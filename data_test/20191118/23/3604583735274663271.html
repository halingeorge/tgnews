      <h1>Community forums to examine how our local society functions and where Ballarta is going</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T23:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Caleb Cluff</a></address>
      <p>The Ballaarat Mechanics' Institute (BMI) has partnered with Melbourne's Wheeler Centre to host a series of community discussions, bringing a variety of speakers to the city to investigate topics of public interest and concern.</p>
      <p>The first talk, titled<i> Local Lens: Refugees in Regional Australia</i>, is on Wednesday November 20. It features well-known human rights advocate and lawyer Julian Burnside AO QC speaking alongside Ballarat refugee community mentor Deruka Dekuek and aged care worker Akua Ed Nignpense on issues facing refugees in regional Australia.</p>

      <p>Ms Dekuek works within Ballarat supporting the diverse refugee and migrant communities, while Ms Ed Nignpense is with Aged Care at Ballarat Health Services, and in Ballarat Community Health, where she works with refugees and asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>They will consider how the tenor of debate in Canberra, and the nature of policies affecting humanitarian immigrants, affect the daily lives of refugees in places like Ballarat. How does it impact the capacity for local communities to provide the support refugees need?</p>
      <p>Ballarat is Victoria's fastest growing regional city and a designated Refugee Welcome Zone. The city has a diverse, active migrant and refugee community, and strong support from local leadership.</p>
      <blockquote>On a global and national scale, our humanitarian performance is under constant scrutiny. How are we performing locally? Are asylum seekers coming to Australia getting adequate support and a chance to thrive in their new communities?<cite>Paula Nicholson, BMI</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The BMI's Paula Nicholson says the partnership is an incredibly exciting opportunity for the organisation and for the people of Ballarat in general to explore issues in a public forum.</p>
      <p>"This discussion at the Ballaarat Mechanics' Institute will consider a global issue through a local lens," says Ms Nicholson.</p>
      <p>"Mass human displacement is one of the most complex ethical and legal global challenges of our time. Australia's response to asylum seeker arrivals has attracted controversy over the years, including criticism from the United Nations.</p>
      <p>"Last year, the federal government commissioned a report into integration, employment, and settlement outcomes for refugees and humanitarian entrants. We're still awaiting the results of this report.</p>
      <p>"On a global and national scale, our humanitarian performance is under constant scrutiny. How are we performing locally? Are asylum seekers coming to Australia getting adequate support and a chance to thrive in their new communities?"</p>
      <p>Tickets for <i>Local Lens: Refugees in Regional Australia</i> are $10 plus a one-off transaction fee of $4.00 per order, with $2 from each ticket going to Ballarat Regional Multicultural Council and Centre for Multicultural Youth Ballarat. Ms Nicholson says the Wheeler Centre is taking on most of the costs associated with the forum.</p>
      <p>"For us it represents the opportunity to bring world class speakers to Ballarat whilst keeping the cost down to the attendees," Ms Nicholson says.</p>
      <p>"This is a fabulous outcome and we are currently finalising the other three events for 2020 to complete this first series."</p>
