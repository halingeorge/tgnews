      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Kenya’s former attorney general, Amos Sitswila Wako, accusing him of involvement in “significant” corruption, according to a statement from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>
      <p>Wako, who was attorney general during Kenya’s rocky transition from one-party rule to democracy, is barred from entering the United States under the sanctions, as are his wife and son.</p>
      <p>Washington criticized Wako several times during his tenure as attorney general from 1991 to 2011 for not doing enough to crack down on corruption.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the U.S. government banned him from traveling to the United States, accusing him of obstructing the fight against corruption in Kenya. The move sparked a diplomatic row with Kenya.</p>
      <p>Wako has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>After serving as attorney general, Wako was elected to Kenya’s senate in 2013 and was re-elected for a second term in 2017.</p>
      <p>“Today’s action sends a strong signal that the United States is a valuable partner in Kenya’s fight against corruption,” Pompeo said in a statement. He did not detail the allegations.</p>
      <p>Wako was blacklisted under an executive order that prohibits officials of foreign governments involved in corruption from entering the United States, as well as their immediate family members.</p>
