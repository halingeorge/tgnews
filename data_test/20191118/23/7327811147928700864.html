      <p>MONTCLAIR, New Jersey (WABC) -- If you're in the market for a new house, there's a historic home in New Jersey that some just can't bear to tear down. So you can have it - if you can move it.</p>
      <p>Tom Lapenter is the project boss for Redeemer Church, which owns the 109-year-old house at 23 North Willow Street in Montclair.</p>
      <p>He's overseeing construction of the church's new building, which does away with their need to keep the house.</p>
      <p>So the house is available, provided you can take it away.</p>
      <p>"You're gonna need traffic control with the police," said Lapenter. "You're gonna need utilities involved, there are lines in the way. It's not a small task."</p>
      <p>And not a small cost.</p>
      <p>"I would think initially you'd need about $100,000 and then depending how far you go it's just going to go up from there," said Lapenter.</p>
      <p>It's in a town quite particular about preservation and history.</p>
      <p>"When a structure has existed for over 100 years, particularly if it has architectural merit, it really needs to be thought about," said David Greenbaum of the Montclair Preservation Commission.</p>
      <p>He and others are mounting a huge effort to save the old Lackawanna train station just up the street and around the corner. He sees these historical structures as the lifeblood of the community.</p>
      <p>"I think a lot of people are taking the time to reflect upon what's important going forward as to the quality of life and the streetscape," said Greenbaum.</p>
      <p>He says the preservation commission is trying to draft a new demolition ordinance so that the town can have more say on what happens to historic sites there.</p>
