      <p>Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm led his the Bulldogs to victory once again last weekend. Unfortunately, his team’s win came at the expense of Auburn tight end Tyler Fromm, his younger brother.</p>
      <p>But the two Fromm brothers showed no animosity at all after the rivalry game.</p>
      <p>They met on the field after the game was over and exchanged jerseys before hugging and returning to their lockers.</p>

      <p>Jake Fromm went 13-of-28 for 110 yards but three touchdown passes in the win. It was his third straight game with multiple touchdown passes without an interception.</p>
      <p>As for Tyler Fromm, he did not play in Saturday’s game, and is still waiting to make his college football debut.</p>
      <p>Even though Jake is a junior, this may be the last time that the Fromm brothers play on the same field again.</p>
      <p>Though Auburn and Georgia are slated to play each other next year, Jake is expected to enter the NFL Draft this fall.</p>
      <p>But if Tyler can assert himself as an elite tight end in college football, maybe they’ll see each other again on the field at the professional level.</p>
