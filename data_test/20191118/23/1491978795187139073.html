        <li>Australia to play in Ireland in November next year</li>
        <li>Game is hybrid of Gaelic and Australian rules football</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The two-game International Rules Series will return in 2020 after a three-year hiatus, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl">AFL</a> confirmed on Tuesday. Ireland will host the series in November next year and while the venues have yet to be announced, the provisional dates are 15 and 21 November.</p>
      <p>The series will then be held in Australia at some stage after the 2022 AFL season. The hybrid game facilitates international representative matches between AFL players and Gaelic football players.</p>
      <p>“We want to take the best of the best to the two-Test series in Ireland next year and our All Australian players will be the first players selected,” Steve Hocking, AFL general manager of football operations, said.</p>
      <p>“The IRS Tests allows players from both codes the only opportunity to represent their countries and have traditionally been great contests that have showcased their athleticism.”</p>
      <p>The Australian team’s training camp will be in New York before the matches in Ireland. The Australians won both Tests in 2017, in Perth and Adelaide, to reclaim the Cormac McAnallen Cup.<br/><br/>GAA director general Tom Ryan said: “We are pleased to announce the return of the International Rules Series in 2020 and look forward to re-connecting with our friends and colleagues in the AFL, both on and off the field.</p>
      <p>“The series offers our players the chance to wear the green jersey and represent Ireland and it also provides them with an opportunity to pit themselves against the best from another code while showcasing the best skills of Gaelic football.”</p>
