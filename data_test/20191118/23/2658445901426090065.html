      <p><b>T</b>he ESQ Nigerian Legal Awards is focused on celebrating the best in the legal profession, its Managing Director/CEO, Lere Fashola, has said.</p>
      <p>He stated this in his welcome address at the 2019 edition of the awards held at the Landmark Event Centre, Lagos.</p>
      <p>At the event, persons, law firms and corporate organisations that had made the legal profession proud were honoured.</p>
      <p>Fashola said: “When we envisioned the idea of an awards ceremony, we did not fully appreciate the gravity of the undertaking. However, through the years and after many different experiences that we have learnt from, we have made considerable progress. What we see now is a culmination of 10 years of consistent and dedicated efforts.</p>
      <p>“At ESQ NLA, we stand for excellence, we believe in excellence and we reward excellence. Hence, we considered it imperative to recognise the excellent and important contributions to the legal profession.”</p>
      <p>The event celebrated “the biggest and the best players in the legal profession; the law firms, the leaders and the icons.”</p>
      <p>Fashola acknowledged that “our future is already being shaped by extraordinary young persons. These are the people that will dictate the future prosperity of the legal profession.”</p>
      <p>40 under 40 lawyers were honoured at the Awards.</p>

      <p>Fashola noted that “if there was any decision most herculean for the judges to reach, it was coming up with the 40 honorees out of the galaxy of the over 100 star finalists.</p>
      <p>“The role of new wigs and younger lawyers in the profession cannot be overlooked. With the best grooming, training and mentorship and the right work ethics, they can aspire and certainly reach for the peak of the profession.</p>
      <p>“It is for this reason that ESQ is building the first professional co-work station for lawyers. The station will be a hub for cutting edge continuing legal education and innovative legal practice. They are the future of the legal profession in Nigeria and they must join the moving train.”</p>
      <p>According to him, what made the 2019 edition of the Nigerian Legal Awards unique was the attention the organisers paid to “every aspect of the planning process. From the pooling of our distinguished Judges to the nominations stage, from the selection of venue to the engagement of the judges and eventually to this very moment, we have ensured to be meticulous at arriving at every critical point of this award ceremony.”</p>
      <p>Fashola said none of that would have been possible without the collective efforts of many key contributors.</p>
      <p>“First is the inestimable efforts of our distinguished Judges. Ably led by the Chairman, Dr Olusegun Akin-Olugbade, our panel worked extensively and passionately for months to deliver on their mandate. We also appreciate ourPartners who believe that working with us is a worthy investment.</p>
      <p>We cannot thank them enough for having faith in us and what we do.</p>
      <p>“Dear distinguished industry leaders and mentors, we acknowledge your towering support and contribution to the profession that we so dearly love. You are our icons and we pay our gratitude for leading the path for us to tread. Distinguished guests, thank you very much for gracing us with your presence. The Awards is nothing without you, indeed.</p>
      <p>Dear guests and friends, we have come a long way together. ESQ Nigerian Legal Awards has crawled, walked, run and with you beside us, we are ready to fly” Fashola stated.</p>
      <p>Dangote Industries, Law Pavilion, Aluko &amp; Oyebode, Mr. Olumide Akpata, Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Edo State Professor, Yinka Omoregbe  were among  recipients of the award in 2019.</p>
