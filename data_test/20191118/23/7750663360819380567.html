      <h1>Tottenham Hotspur 'planning for Mauricio Pochettino exit'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> are reportedly planning for life after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> with the London club expecting their head coach to move on at some point in the near future.</h2>

      <p>Spurs reached last season's Champions League final but have struggled for results this term, winning just three of their 12 Premier League games to sit 14th in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">the table</a>, already 20 points off leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The London giants will take on bitter rivals West Ham United this weekend, and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/sack-race/news/pochettino-given-one-game-to-save-spurs-job_378772.html">it has been suggested</a> that a defeat to the Hammers could spell the end of Pochettino's time in charge.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, senior figures at Spurs have already held conversations over an exit strategy, with Bournemouth's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eddie-howe/"><b>Eddie Howe</b></a>, RB Leipzig's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/julian-nagelsmann/"><b>Julian Nagelsmann</b></a> and Napoli's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/carlo-ancelotti/"><b>Carlo Ancelotti</b></a> all being considered as replacements.</p>
      <p>However, the report claims that the London club would have to pay 'significant compensation' in order to bring any of the three coaches to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> is also <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/transfer-talk/news/jose-mourinho-eyeing-tottenham-hotspur-role_379675.html">allegedly eyeing a role with Spurs</a> as the Portuguese is keen on a return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has been linked with the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid in recent months, although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a> appear to be safe in their roles for the moment.</p>
