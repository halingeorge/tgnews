        <b>Damon Kinsella (Jacob Roberts) was sent to prison for fraud in Hollyoaks after he used the money from Maxine Minniver’s (Nikki Sanderson) trust fund in order to allow his wife to live out what he believed to be her final few weeks in bliss. He makes a return to the village in the coming episodes, but could there be a surprise new romance in store for the young man?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Damon’s world came crashing down several months ago when he discovered that Maxine had been lying about being terminally ill.</p>
      <p>After spending the best part of a year believing that she was dying, learning otherwise was undoubtedly a bit of a shock, but he had little to time to process the news, as he was sentenced to serve time in prison for spending the trust fund money on holidays and gifts for Maxine.</p>

      <p>In the coming episodes, Damon returns to the village — and he’s not the only one either, as his release coincides with Maxine’s arrival back in Chester.</p>

      <p>However, it would appear as if Damon might be offered the chance at romance with another Hollyoaks favourite, as — after setting her sights on him for the first time since his sentencing — Maxine is shocked to see Liberty (Jessamy Stoddart) in his company, and she’s being overtly flirtatious too. As a result, Maxine believes that they’re <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a>.</p>

      <p>Her theory might not be wrong either as, later in the pub, Liberty kisses Damon — and Brody (Adam Woodward) and Scott (Ross Adams) are speechless as a result. Mind you, so is Damon!</p>
      <p>The events which lead to Liberty kissing Damon are unknown, but could this perhaps be the start of something very special?</p>
      <p>If so, how will Maxine feel about it?</p>
