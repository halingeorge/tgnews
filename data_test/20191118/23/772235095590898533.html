      <p><b>Honda's</b> updated <b>Civic hatchback</b> will arrive in Australia <b>early in 2020,</b> with a set of small changes to keep it fresh amid strong competition.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/honda/">Honda Australia</a> says the facelifted hatch will be "a similar update to the one <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/civic/">Civic</a> sedan received in February this year" – which means minor styling and trim tweaks are in the works, as previewed by the 2020 Civic hatch revealed for Europe earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Compared to the current model, the updated Civic revealed in the EU gets a revised front bumper with full LED headlamps, and updated LED daytime running lights.</p>
      <p>There are also detail changes to the rear bumper, and a range of new alloy wheel designs to help differentiate the updated model.</p>

      <p>It also gets a revised infotainment system with a proper volume knob and fixed buttons for the main infotainment functions, and hard buttons for the fan speed on cars with dual-zone climate control, changes rolled into the Civic sedan in February this year.</p>
      <p>Expect the updated Civic to feature the same 1.8-litre naturally aspirated engine in base models making 104kW and 174Nm with a 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol serving 127kW and 220Nm in high-grade cars.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date, the Civic is sitting on 8769 reported sales – down from 11,339 at the same point in 2018.</p>
