      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> have identified Eddie Howe, Julian Nagelsmann and Carlo Ancelotti as possible candidates to take over from struggling manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, rated as one of the best managers in Europe, is currently enduring the most difficult spell of his Spurs career.</p>
      <p>Having led Tottenham to four successive top-four finishes in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>, Pochettino now faces a fight to save his job in north London.</p>

      <p>Spurs have won just three of their 12 league games this season and sit 14th in the table – below Newcastle, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/crystal-palace-fc/">Crystal Palace</a> and Brighton – ahead of Saturday’s trip to London rivals West Ham.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699319/Time-running-Mauricio-Pochettino-just-matter-leaves-Tottenham.html">Daily Mail</a> say Tottenham are privately planning for Pochettino’s departure, with some insiders doubting the Argentine will turn things around.</p>
      <p>And it is claimed three managers – Howe, Nagelsmann and Ancelotti – have emerged as figures of interest for Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Howe, 41, has helped establish Bournemouth as a mid-table Premier League team over the past three years and is seen as one of the most promising managers in England.</p>
      <p>German boss Nagelsmann is also well-respected in Europe, with his RB Leipzig side currently second in the Bundesliga table.</p>
      <p>Former Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG and Chelsea manager Ancelotti has won domestic titles in Italy, England, France and Germany and would be a safe pair of hands if Spurs opted to make a change mid-season.</p>

      <p>Amid Pochettino’s struggles, former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp says Spurs would be crazy to sack the Argentine.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun: ‘He’s a fantastic manager. You are only as good as your players and they need to pick up their form.</p>
      <p>‘It would not even come into the equation for me to get rid of him.’</p>
