        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/breda-mcqueen/">Breda McQueen</a> (Moya Brady) has committed murder after murder in Hollyoaks, and she could be about to do so again in order to protect son Sylver (David Tag), as Grace Black (Tamar Wall) proves to be a thorn in her side — and her actions in the coming episodes could end up putting Sylver in the frame for Mercedes’ (Jennifer Metcalfe) shooting.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The entire village was shaken to its very core several weeks back, and no we’re not referring to crane collapse — although the same could be said for that, too — but rather the moment when Grace revealed that Mercedes was the one responsible for the hit-and-run — not to mention the fact that she threatened to kill Harry (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/parry-glasspool/">Parry Glasspool</a>).</p>
      <p>Afterwards, someone sought murderous revenge and left Mercedes for dead in The Loft, but — with the shooter still seemingly at large — all eyes are on everyone in the village.</p>

      <p>In spite of his wife’s shooting, Sylver has been spending a lot of time with Grace and, in the coming episodes, Breda is left disgusted when Grace enters the living room of the flat above The Dog in nothing but a dressing gown — with Sylver’s tool belt as an accompaniment.</p>

      <p>Not only does she find such behaviour unholy, but she’s worried that Sylver’s lack of care about his wife’s condition could end up making him look guilty in the eyes of the law. Then of course, there’s the fact that he’s killed before to factor in, which could mean that the police think he’s got form.</p>

      <p>Breda scolds him, and asks him to choose between his family and Grace.</p>
      <p>Which option will Sylver choose?</p>
      <p>If it’s the latter, Breda may be forced to take drastic action to protect her son.</p>
      <p>Thus far, the only people she’s murdered have been those whom she deemed to be bad dads, but given that she nearly offed Tony (Nick Pickard) a few times to save her own skin, she could well end up murdering Grace in order to protect her child.</p>
