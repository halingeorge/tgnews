      <h1>Derek Jeter, Steroid Era stars at forefront of Hall of Fame storylines</h1>

      <p>Derek Jeter’s imperfections on the field energized the sabermetric community for years, yet that doesn’t prevent him from attaining perfection over the next couple of months.</p>
      <p>The former Yankees captain, now the Marlins’ CEO, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/derek-jeter-isnt-the-only-ex-yankee-getting-his-first-hall-of-fame-chance-now/">headlined the Hall of Fame’s list of new candidates</a>, released Monday, on the Baseball Writers’ Association of America’s ballot. Zero doubt exists that the All-Star shortstop will pass the 75 percent threshold necessary for 2020 induction. The primary suspense surrounding Jeter will be: Can he match his Core Fourmate Mariano Rivera, who made history last year when he received 425 of 425 votes, reaching the 100 percent mark that had been untouched (by writers) since 1936?</p>
      <p>Locally, Jeter’s quest to tie Rivera’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/19/hopeful-mechanic-to-hall-of-fame-mariano-riveras-perfect-underdog-story/">unbeatable percentage</a> ranks as the top Hall of Fame storyline, and we enjoy such storylines’ steady developments thanks to the yeoman’s work performed by Ryan Thibodaux, better known as <a href="https://twitter.com/NotMrTibbs">@NotMrTibbs</a> on Twitter, who keeps a running tally as most voters publish their ballots (or share them privately with Thibodaux).</p>
      <p>Here are other tales to follow between now and the announcement of the writers’ ballot, Jan. 21, 2020 on the MLB Network:</p>
      <p><b>1. Flying Solo?</b> A real possibility stands that Jeter will be the sole candidate voted in on the writers’ ballot, as none of the holdovers from last year earned so much as 61 percent and none of Jeter’s fellow freshmen is likely to join him as a first-year electee; Jeter’s former Yankees teammate Bobby Abreu might be the only rookie to accrue the 5 percent necessary for inclusion on the 2021 ballot. Nevertheless, he’s likely to be joined by a winner or two from the Modern Baseball Committee, which will announce its results on Dec. 8. How about a pinstriped fantasy of Jeter and two more Yankees captains, Don Mattingly and Thurman Munson, entering the Hall all at once?</p>
      <p><b>2. A Curt Response?</b> The top holdover would be Mr. Curt Schilling, who drew 60.9 percent on the 2019 ballot and enters his eighth year of consideration. Schilling <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/22/derek-jeters-hall-of-fame-nod-could-come-with-painful-red-sox-company/">generates some controversy</a> for his baseball credentials, as his 216 regular-season wins might seem a little light (they aren’t, not when you factor in his strikeouts-to-walks ratio and postseason dominance), and a hurricane of chatter over his inflammatory takes, be it calling for the lynching of journalists, mocking the transgender community or accusing respected outfielder Adam Jones of lying about hearing a racist taunt at Fenway Park. If he does gain entry, expect that hurricane to envelop Cooperstown.</p>
      <p><b>3. The Steroids Era Scapegoats.</b> Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, like Schilling, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/22/ped-tainted-bonds-clemens-still-fall-short-in-hall-of-fame-voting/">will enter their eighth year of consideration</a>. Both have climbed slowly if steadily, Bonds from 36.2 percent in 2013 to 59.1 percent in 2019 and Clemens from 37.6 to 59.5 in the same time span. They’ll need to pick up the pace, albeit only a little, in order to get to 75 percent by 2022. The key determinant? How many new voters — by virtue of clocking 10 years in the BBWAA — join the mix and check the Bonds and Clemens boxes versus how many opponents lose their votes — by either spending 10 years out of baseball writing or falling ill or worse.</p>
      <p><b>4. Goodbye, Larry?</b> Only Larry Walker, the guy who hit everywhere, not just at hitter-friendly Coors Field, faces his last shot on the writers’ ballot. With 54.6 percent in his ninth try, the outfielder requires quite a jump to make it to Cooperstown.</p>
      <p><b>5. Primed for Pettitte.</b> With Jeter the only slam-dunk among the new guys, and with four players (Rivera, Roy Halladay, Edgar Martinez and Mike Mussina) inducted off of last year’s writers’ ballot, some runway has been cleared for Yankees legend Andy Pettitte to make a jump <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/22/andy-pettitte-survives-hall-ballot-but-faces-battle-to-enshrinement/">from the 9.9 percent he gathered in his first try</a>. Others who should and must capitalize on this opportunity to gain the support of “Big Hall” voters that use all 10 of their allotted ballot slots are Omar Vizquel (42.8 percent in 2019) Manny Ramirez (22.8), Jeff Kent (18.1), Scott Rolen (17.2), Billy Wagner (16.7), Todd Helton (16.5), Gary Sheffield (13.6), Sammy Sosa (8.5) and Andruw Jones (7.5).</p>
