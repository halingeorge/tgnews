      <p>Xabi Alonso has heaped praise on Fabinho and outlined what makes the Liverpool midfielder so effective.</p>
      <p>Brazilian midfielder Fabinho has recovered from a slow start to his career at Anfield to develop into one of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s most important players.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has produced a number of eye-catching performances this season to help Liverpool storm eight points clear at the top of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> and impress in Europe.</p>

      <p>Spanish legend Alonso also impressed at Anfield, most notably starring in Liverpool’s stunning <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> triumph in 2005, and is already a big admirer of Fabinho.</p>
      <p>‘He is connected to the game, always. His anticipation is his greatest asset,’ Alonso told <a href="https://athletique.com/1355420/2019/11/16/xabi-alonso-exclusive-i-dont-want-to-be-known-for-what-i-have-done-i-want-to-be-known-for-what-i-am-doing/">The Athletic</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes you only have to take one or two steps to change the movements of your team-mates and that can determine the whole outcome of the game without anyone really realising because spectators tend to follow the ball rather than the player.</p>

      <p>‘He’s not reacting one second later, he’s anticipating what is going to happen one second before.’</p>
      <p>Fabinho was one of three Liverpool players who Premier League legend Alan Shearer picked out for praise following the crucial victory over defending champions Manchester City prior to the international break.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun: ‘Let’s hear it for the Liverpool midfield. Perhaps we should call them ‘The Fab Three’.</p>

      <p>‘This dynamic trio tend to play second fiddle to the Reds’ front line of Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and  Roberto Firmino when it comes to dishing out the plaudits.</p>
      <p>‘But it was the home side’s engine room which made the real difference. Fabinho, Wijnaldum and Henderson made sure that Liverpool controlled the game.</p>
      <p>‘They came up with all the answers and showed everything you want from a top-class midfield unit – productivity, protection, creativity and goals.’</p>
