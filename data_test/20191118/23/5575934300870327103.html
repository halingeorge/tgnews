      <p>Snap CEO Evan Spiegel told <a href="http://4cnbc.com/2019/11/18/snapchat-fact-checks-political-ads-unlike-facebook-ceo-evan-spiegel.html">CNBC</a> in an interview Monday that the company subjects “all advertising to review, including political advertising.” That includes fact-checking, he said.</p>
      <p>Spiegel said that Snap wants to create a space for its younger-skewing user base to “engage with the political conversation, but we don’t allow things like misinformation to appear in that advertising.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the company says that every ad is vetted by a team of humans to make sure that it follows Snapchat’s guidelines, which prohibits being misleading or deceptive. The spokesperson says that Snap has indeed banned a small number of ads under this review process.</p>
      <p>Spiegel’s comments make Snap the latest social media company to weigh in on political ads, in a heated debate that has already ensnared Facebook, Twitter, and Google.</p>
      <p>With its review policy, Snap appears to be staking a middle ground between Facebook and Twitter.</p>
      <p>Facebook has faced <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/facebook-political-ads-fact-check-policy-explained-2019-11">intense criticism</a> from lawmakers and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/facebook-employees-zuckerberg-letter-call-for-fact-checking-political-ads-2019-10">its own employees</a> over its refusal to fact-check political ads on its platform. In a jab at Facebook, Twitter <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/twitter-political-ads-ban-new-details-2019-11">took the opposite approach</a>, saying it will ban political ads entirely, though questions remain about how Twitter will enforce the policy in practice.</p>
      <p>Google has remained relatively quiet on the matter, but did <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-plans-to-ban-political-ads-before-canada-election-the-globe-and-mail-2019-3">ban political ads in Canada</a> ahead of an election earlier this year, saying it would be hard to comply with the country’s new transparency rules.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting that Snap has a <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/snap-stock-gets-two-lofty-price-targets-analysts-cite-ads-2019-9-1028549871#">substantially smaller digital advertising business than Facebook</a>, which also might make it more realistic to proactively review content than its larger rivals.</p>
