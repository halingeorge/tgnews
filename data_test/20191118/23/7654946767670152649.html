      <h1>South Dakota’s new ‘on meth’ campaign prompts ridicule, confusion</h1>

      <p>Looks like they really ‘methed’ this one up.</p>
      <p>South Dakota on Monday launched a nearly half-a-million dollar methamphetamine prevention campaign — with a head-scratching slogan. The anti-drug crusade’s website is OnMeth.com and the logo is an outline of the Mount Rushmore State with the phrase: “Meth. We’re on it.”</p>
      <p>TV ads, billboards and posters about South Dakota’s growing epidemic feature people of all demographics saying, “I’m on meth.”</p>
      <p>The state’s Department of Social Services paid Minneapolis-based marketing and ad agency Broadhead Co. nearly $449,000 to create the campaign, <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/18/gov-kristi-noem-launches-anti-meth-campaign-meth-were-it/4227949002/">according to the Sioux Falls Argus Leader</a>.</p>
      <p>The seemingly contradictory motto left some folks confused and prompted guffaws from others.</p>
      <p>“What was the ad agency smoking when they came up with this campaign?,” <a href="https://twitter.com/TaraLynnSaid/status/1196551110280073216">asked Twitter user @TaraLynnSaid</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/johnjbroker/status/1196543144483053568">Another person wrote</a>: “I love parody news, but this is actually real! No one involved in this brought up how startlingly bad this is?”</p>
      <p>“NO! South Dakota is NOT on meth. They running a poorly thought out ad campaign though!,” <a href="https://twitter.com/romanknitter/status/1196552057752301572">@romanknitter attempted to clarify</a>.</p>
      <p>In a video message announcing the campaign, Gov. Kristi Noem explained the tagline’s meaning as, “Each one of us, no matter who we are, we’re on the case of meth.”</p>
      <p>“This campaign is going to be about solutions and hope and how every single one of us in South Dakota can partner to be on meth,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/govnoem/videos/496384087625269/">Noem said</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re protecting our families, we’re protecting our friends from this epidemic that we see and that we’re all going to be taking some responsibility to be battling it.”</p>
      <p>The state’s budget includes $1 million for meth treatment services and more than $730,000 for school-based meth prevention programming, the Argus Leader reported.</p>
