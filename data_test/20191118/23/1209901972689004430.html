      <h1>Crown seeks Supreme Court of Canada hearing in railway terror case</h1>
      <h2>Raed Jaser and Chiheb Esseghaier were found guilty in 2015 on terror-related charges</h2>

      <p>The Crown is asking the Supreme Court of Canada to review an appeal court’s decision to order a new trial for two men convicted of plotting to crash a Via Rail train.</p>
      <p>In a written submission to the high court, federal lawyers say the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the convictions on the basis of a “highly technical error” in the jury selection process that did not interfere with the fair-trial rights of either man.</p>
      <p>Raed Jaser and Chiheb Esseghaier were found guilty in 2015 on terror-related charges arising from an al-Qaida-inspired plot to derail a passenger train.</p>
      <p>Both were sentenced to life in prison.</p>
      <p>In August, the appeal court ordered a fresh trial for the men on grounds the jury that convicted them was improperly chosen.</p>
      <p>Following the decision, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada said it would proceed with a new trial, but noted it had 60 days to decide whether to seek permission to appeal from the Supreme Court.</p>
