      <h1>PlayStation Plus 12-month codes just dropped from $60 to $25, and you’re insane if you don’t re-up</h1>

      <p>UPDATE: It should come as no surprise that this deal sold out fast. That said, you might want to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=b0c55-20">head to the product page</a> anyway to see if it’s back in stock because we’ve seen similar sales in the past go in and out of stock all day long.</p>
      <p>EARLIER: Amazon just released a <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/18/black-friday-deals-2019-amazon-preview-of-all-the-best-deals/"><b>massive preview of all its best Black Friday 2019 deals</b></a>, but we have something even better that you don’t have to wait for. If you’re a gamer and Sony’s PlayStation 4 is your console of choice, congratulations because Black Friday just started almost two weeks early. That’s right, the deal everyone waits for each just is here early, and it offers an even bigger discount than it has in the past! <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=b0c55-20">PlayStation Plus 12 Month Membership Digital Codes</a> sell for $60 and that price typically falls to $30 for Black Friday. If you hurry up and grab them before they inevitably sell out, you can snag 12-month codes right now for just $24.99 a piece! That’s an all-time low, and remember that these codes are stackable so you can buy however many you want, and they’ll add that number of years to your current PlayStation Plus balance!</p>
