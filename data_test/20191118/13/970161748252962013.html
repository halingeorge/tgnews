      <p>A five year-old boy ate his father’s cocaine – then told his teacher that being high on the drug made him feel like Spiderman, police say.</p>
      <p>The unidentified youngster brought a baggie of the illegal drug to Lawrence Elementary <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> in Holyoke, Massachusetts, last Thursday.</p>
      <p>It was stamped with pictures of Spiderman, with the boy telling his teacher that when he took the drug it made him feel like the superhero.</p>
      <p>The boy’s teacher told the school principal, who called an ambulance and the police.</p>
      <p>He was taken to hospital as a precaution, although the bag was sealed, and police do not believe he took any of its contents.</p>

      <p>It is unclear whether the youngster may previously have taken cocaine from other bags, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/5-year-old-brings-cocaine-class-says-it-makes-him-n1084331?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">NBC News</a> reported.</p>

      <p>His dad, Benny Garcia, was found asleep at his home by police. There were 38 bags of cocaine and 70 bags of heroin in the house, it is alleged.</p>
      <p>Garcia was being sought by police on separate drugs charges at the time of the incident with his son, and now faces further counts of the same offense.</p>
      <p>The boy and his baby sibling both lived with Garcia and their mom, but have now been taken into social services custody.</p>
      <p>Garcia is in jail ahead of a court hearing Wednesday to decide whether he should be freed on bail.</p>
