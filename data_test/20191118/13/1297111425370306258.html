      <h2>"We need to make sure that we have a 'made in Saskatchewan' approach to both economic development and alienation."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:00:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/howard-leeson" target="_blank">Howard Leeson</a></address>
      <p>Last Monday, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/politics/scott-moe-disappointed-to-hear-nothing-new-from-prime-minister-trudeau-at-meeting">Premier Moe met with Prime Minister Trudeau</a> and missed a golden opportunity.</p>
      <p>Partly through lack of experience, and probably because of a loyalty to Jason Kenney, the premier failed to take advantage of a situation that may not come his way again soon.</p>
      <p>Premier Moe went to Ottawa with a series of demands that were only slightly different from what he has been saying over the past year.</p>
      <p>These included a one year “hoist” on the carbon tax in Saskatchewan, an agreement to make changes to the equalization formula, and an insistence that the federal government make substantial changes to two key pieces of federal environmental legislation. He argued that these were needed because of economic circumstances in Saskatchewan, particularly having to do with a poor harvest this year, and because of rising alienation in the province.</p>
      <p>A closer look at his proposals, however, shows that they would do little to alleviate immediate economic problems.</p>
      <p>While removing the carbon tax in Saskatchewan would slightly reduce natural gas costs for farmers who are drying grain, the bulk of the reduction would go back to individuals who are already receiving carbon levy rebates through their income tax reductions. Any changes to equalization would be years in the making, and again, would come back to individual taxpayers and not to the Government of Saskatchewan. Finally, changes to federal environmental legislation might speed up some projects, but they fly in the face of the goal set out by the Government of Saskatchewan to substantially reduce carbon levels in the province.</p>
      <p>The main problem with these proposals is that they are the same as what’s being put forward by Alberta. The Government of Saskatchewan needs to quit being a junior partner to Premier Kenney. Our economy is different, our interests are often divergent from Alberta, and while we should support other western Canadian governments on some issues, we need to make sure that we have a “made in Saskatchewan” approach to both economic development and alienation.</p>
      <p>I would suggest three things.</p>
      <p>First, he can and should move immediately through SaskEnergy to substantially reduce the cost of natural gas to farmers who are drying grain. He can finance this through a reduced dividend from the Crown corporations, and more importantly, he should ask the federal government to pay half of the program.</p>
      <p>Second, if the federal government is unwilling to move on the carbon tax, the premier should negotiate a new Saskatchewan economic development agreement that could be financed by the federal government, providing a substantial pool of investment capital for the province.</p>
      <p>Finally, recognizing his own inexperience, the premier should call on the three former premiers of the province to provide advice.</p>
      <p>Grant Devine was successful in negotiating agricultural payment agreements in the 1980s, Lorne Calvert had extensive experience negotiating on equalization, and Roy Romanow was a towering figure during constitutional and federal-provincial matters over three decades. The premier should form a Premiers Advisory Committee and seek their counsel on how to deal with alienation in the province.</p>
      <p>While these practical things may not be as “sexy” as fighting the carbon tax, they will result in significant advantages, especially for Saskatchewan farmers.</p>
      <p>It is time, Mr. Premier, to pull the province and Canada together.</p>
