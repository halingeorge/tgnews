      <p>The first <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/cardiffs-walkabout-launches-im-celeb-15529924">Bushtucker Trial</a> of the 2019 series of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/im-celebrity-out-here-confirmed-17241089">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!</a> gets underway in skin-crawling fashion, with Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway locked in crates and covered with 30,000 cockroaches.</p>
      <p>The American TV star and the UK presenter find themselves suspended high above a river Down Under and tasked with having to drop balls from a great height into a passing receptacle below during the task, which will be broadcast on Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>And that would be difficult enough, without the two also having to share their enclosed space with legions of creepy crawlies.</p>
      <p>But it's <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/odds-slashed-caitlyn-jenner-winning-17273383">Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a>' Jenner who copes best, keeping her cool as the insect interlopers swarm all over her.</p>

      <p>"Oh boy, we've got a lot of friends in here," she says, while Garraway freaks out at the sudden infestation, screaming, "Oh God, no, no!"</p>
      <p>So, given that the pair an attempting to win food for their camp mates, it looks as though a number of famous faces could be going hungry tonight.</p>
      <p>Among the well-known line-up are former footballer Ian Wright, Girls Aloud's Nadine Coyle, X Factor winner Myles Stephenson, stand-up comic Andrew Maxwell, ex-EastEnder Jacqueline Jossa, breakfast DJs Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts and retired rugby player James Haskell.</p>
      <p>The launch of the latest series on Sunday, November 17 marked <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/im-a-celebrity-ant-dec-17271147">the first time presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have been in the jungle together since 2017</a>.</p>

      <p>Last year, Dec was forced to team up with Holly Willoughby to present the popular series after Ant took time away to deal with a drink and prescription-drugs addiction.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, he made his return to the Aussie jungle in a rather casual fashion, opening the show by acknowledging: "We're back, I'm back, he's back, we're all back."</p>
