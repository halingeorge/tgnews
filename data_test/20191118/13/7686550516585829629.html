      </figure>
      <p>Over the weekend Prince Andrew was interviewed by the BBC's Emily Maitlis in an attempt to tackle questions over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The Prince faces allegations surrounding Virginia Giuffre, whose surname was Roberts at the time of the alleged incidents. She has claimed she was forced three times by Epstein to have sex with the Prince. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50446065">Prince Andrew categorically denies the claims,</a> saying he has "no recollection" of ever meeting her.</p>
      <p>The interview was always going to attract a lot of attention and since it was broadcast there has been a great deal of discussion. Was it the right decision or a mistake?</p>
      <h3>The Claim</h3>
      <p>When one emerges from an interview which is subsequently described as <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-interview-watching-plane-crash-1170521">"a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad"</a> then one might be forgiven for wondering who made the decision for the interview to go ahead in the first place.</p>
      <p>If Prince Andrew went into the interview expecting to clear his name and end any Epstein-based suspicion around him then he was very much mistaken.</p>
      <p>PR expert Mark Borkowski describes the interview as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-masterclass-not-do-pr/">a classic example of how not to do it,</a> suggesting it was an "ill-judged attempt to control the headlines" which was thoroughly deconstructed by Maitlis.</p>
      <p>The camera is unforgiving. Every gesture and word captured, every awkward silence preserved. Borkowski reckons they'll be teaching the Prince Andrew interview in PR courses for years to come for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>The Prince's explanations ranged from a confusing claim about him not being able to sweat due to an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War to a very strange answer where he said he couldn't have been where Giuffre said he was because he distinctly remembered taking his daughter to Pizza Express in Woking.</p>
      <p>When the answers intended to counteract allegations only raise more questions and suspicions then the decision to go for the interview looks like a big mistake.</p>
      <h3>The Counter Claim</h3>
      <p>Somebody who does think the interview went rather well for Prince Andrew is the man himself, who reportedly said it had been a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-andrew-interview-latest-jeffrey-epstein-bbc-paedophile-a9206661.html">"great success".</a></p>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph was told the Prince was "operating in a silo" over his decision to go for the interview and was pleased with the way it turned out. They report <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/17/queen-did-not-approve-prince-andrews-excruciating-newsnight/?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=li-recommendation-widget">the Queen didn't give her approval for the interview.</a></p>
      <p>During the interview he said he "let the side down" over his friendship with Epstein and doesn't regret the friendship due to the "opportunities that I was given to learn by him".</p>
      <p>Maitlis talked about her experience interviewing Prince Andrew and notes that he gave her filming crew a tour of Buckingham Palace where the interview was conducted and made a reference to the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/emily-maitlis-my-interview-with-prince-andrew-8hhclpwcf">"next time you come".</a></p>
      <p>He also said he would testify on the matter under oath "if push came to shove" and he was "duty bound to do so".</p>
      <h3>The Facts</h3>
      <p>Jeffrey Epstein was convicted in 2008 of procuring an underage girl for prostitution and served prison time.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in July of this year on charges of sex trafficking, though was found dead in his cell on August 10. His death ended any chance of pursuing criminal charges and a judge dismissed the charges before the end of the month.</p>

      <p>Perspecs is a free app that curates the top news stories from a variety of established regional, national and international news sources. Unlike traditional aggregators and news curation services, Perspecs goes a step further and offers readers 3 polarised opinions of the same story.</p>
      <p>How these opinions are categorised can vary. For political stories this could be in the form of 'left', 'background', 'right'. For review items the categories could be 'negative', 'neutral', 'positive'.</p>
      <p>Readers often stick to their regular sources of news therefore often only ever seeing one side of a story. Perspecs will give you the opportunity to see things from a different perspective and allow you to form your own informed opinion.</p>
      <p>Perspecs will publish 1 edition per day and each edition will be packed with a variety of interesting and sometimes controversial topics. Most importantly, there will be three sides to every story.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, a lawyer representing Epstein's victims said <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-interview-emily-maitlis-epstein-could-used-against/">Prince Andrew's interview could be used against him in a potential cross-examination</a> should he ever find himself in court. The Prince is facing calls to testify to prosecutors in the US about his friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>The Pizza Express in Woking where Prince Andrew said he went to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/17/wokings-pizza-express-customers-struggle-to-remember-first-visit">has been inundated with fake reviews joking about how memorable the experience was.</a></p>
      <p>The full interview can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKQi3wzNFGQ">here.</a></p>
