      <h1>John Obi Mikel: 'Eden Hazard is laziest player I've played with'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-obi-mikel/"><b>John Obi Mikel</b></a> has claimed that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eden-hazard/"><b>Eden Hazard</b></a> 'did not like to train hard' during his time at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Before the start of this season, Hazard ended his long-term association with the Blues in order to make the lucrative switch to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, former teammate Mikel has suggested that the Belgian only managed to secure the move because of his ability, rather than his work-rate.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian told <i>beIN Sports</i>: "The laziest player I have played alongside is Eden Hazard.</p>
      <p>"Hazard has an incredible talent, maybe not as good as [Lionel] Messi, but he can do whatever he wants with the ball at his feet.</p>
      <p>"He didn't like to train hard. While we were working he was waiting for us to finish training just standing there. But on Sundays he was always man of the match, it was unbelievable."</p>
      <p>Hazard has endured a mixed start to life at the Bernabeu, contributing just two goals and two assists from 11 outings.</p>
