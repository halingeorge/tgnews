      <p>The country produced 110.92 MT of crude <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/steel">steel </a>during the same year, a rise of 7.6 per cent as against 103.13 MT in 2017-18, Minister of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/steel">Steel </a><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dharmendra-pradhan">Dharmendra Pradhan </a>said while replying to a question in the Lok Sabha on Monday.</p>
      <p>The minister also said the country exported 6.36 MT of finished steel during 2018-19, registering a fall of 33.9 per cent as compared with 9.62 MT in the previous year.</p>
      <p>Recently, Pradhan said that in the next two-three years, India will be in a position to continue to remain the net exporter of steel for years.</p>
      <p>"We also produce saleable steel. We sometimes become importer, sometimes we are exporter. At present, we are net importer, we are importing about 2-3 MT... Within the next two-three years, India will remain a net exporter of steel for years. There will be no import," he had said while speaking at an industry event.</p>
