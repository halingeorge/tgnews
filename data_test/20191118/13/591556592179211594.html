      <p>Salesforce is launching a redesigned Salesforce Mobile App and a learning app called Trailhead GO with exclusive features to Apple's iOS and iPadOS.<br/><br/>The Apple-Salesforce effort, which was announced at Dreamforce, rhymes with other partnerships with enterprise software vendors and the iPhone maker. For instance, Apple has worked on apps with the likes of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-covers-more-enterprise-bases-teams-up-with-accenture/">Accenture</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-the-apple-ibm-deal-how-will-it-work-and-what-to-expect/">IBM</a>, and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-sap-forge-enterprise-app-pact-for-iphone-ipad/">SAP</a>. The general theme is using Apple's enterprise footprint with iOS, iPhone, and iPad to garner unique business features in apps.</p>

      <p>As part of the Apple-Salesforce partnership, Salesforce launched a new version of the Salesforce Mobile SDK, which enables native apps for iPhone and iPad on Salesforce's platform. Salesforce Mobile SDK will support the latest tools available in Apple's Swift programming language. For good measure, <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/video/7597891/">Apple CEO Tim Cook will have a fireside chat with Salesforce Chairman Marc Benioff</a> at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/schedule/">Dreamforce</a>. <br/><br/>Dan McCall, vice president of product, said the Salesforce Mobile App will bring the company's <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/salesforce-launches-customer-360-aims-to-integrate-all-your-data-applications/">Customer 360 Platform</a> to the small screen. The app has been piloted by more than 1,000 customers over the last year. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/salesforce-outlines-customer-data-platform-aims-to-advance-customer-360-strategy/">Salesforce outlines Customer Data Platform, aims to advance Customer 360 strategy</a> <br/><br/>Among the key items outlined at Dreamforce.</p>
