        <b>A former Meath GAA star who had several medals stolen from his home says he hopes 'somebody grows a conscience' and hands them in.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All Ireland winner Graham Geraghty's house in Athboy was broken into on Friday evening, at some stage between 9:30pm and 10:30pm.</p>
      <p>Gardaí say they are investigating a burglary and no arrests have yet been made.</p>
      <p>Two of Graham's children were in the house at the time, and the former footballer believes the thieves may have been disturbed and fled.</p>
      <p>He said he lives in an area 'you wouldn't be passing by'.</p>
      <p>Graham told Pat Kenny: "They didn't take much - they took the medals, a bit of jewelry, a coat... but that was it.</p>
      <blockquote>"I think it was probably the gold that they were looking for.</blockquote>
      <p>"I had two under-21 Leinster medals; I had a minor Leinster medal; I had two club championship medals... there was a lot in it."</p>
      <p>Graham said his All Ireland medals are off the premises in a safe place, so it was instead the Leinster and club medals that were taken.</p>
      <p>He said the medals are not worth 'a whole lot', but it's the memories that matter - and urged those responsible to give back the stolen items.</p>
      <p>He added: "Hopefully somebody might grow a conscience and hand them in.</p>
      <p>"They're not really worth a lot in monetary value, but if they could hand them in somewhere we'd really appreciate it."</p>
