      <h1>Zack Snyder Reacts to Justice League Stars' #ReleasetheSnyderCut Support</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:11:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jacoby Bancroft</a></address>
      <p>Zack Snyder has responded to a recent outpouring of support for the hotly discussed <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/justice-league-film/"><i>Justice League</i></a> Snyder Cut by turning attention toward suicide prevention.</p>
      <p>Nov. 17 marked the two-year anniversary of the film's theatrical release, and the occasion was met with a renewed push for Warner Bros. to release Snyder's original version by a number of fans and DCEU mainstays. After Twitter posts from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/all-justice-league-stars-demanded-release-snyder-cut/">Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot and Ray Fisher</a> calling to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, Snyder himself shared some black-and-white photos of the <i>Justice League</i> cast on <a href="https://vero.co/zacksnyder/R5-PSBkh3DN58CSBqsnXBZGt">Vero</a>. "Humbled by the outpouring and support," he wrote, along with "#afsp," which is the abbreviation for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.</p>

      <p>Since a personal tragedy forced Snyder to step away from the production of <i>Justice League</i>, the director has become a major advocate for suicide prevention and the push for the rumored Snyder Cut of the superhero film has helped the AFSP lead a campaign that has raised over $100k so far.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-warner-bros-no-plans/">Although Warner Bros.</a> reportedly has no plans to release the Snyder Cut anytime soon, that hasn't stopped fans and actors from pushing the studio every chance they get, which in turn has helped raise awareness for the AFSP.</p>
