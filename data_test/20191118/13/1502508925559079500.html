      <h1>Oil prices hold above $63 on US-China trade deal optimism, Opec meet</h1>
      <h2>China and the United States had "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level call on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:57:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Hopes for a trade deal between the United States and China and expectations that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/opec">OPEC </a>would extend production cuts supported <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil-prices">oil prices </a>on Monday, helping them hold on to last week's gains.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures, which rose 1.3% last week, were little changed, trading at above $63 per barrel at 1100 GMT. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was also flat at $57.7 a barrel, having gained 0.8% last week.</p>
      <p>Oil rose on Friday as comments from a top U.S. official raised optimism for a U.S.-China trade deal, although worries about increasing crude supplies capped prices.</p>
      <p>"In the short term, U.S.-China trade talks and (the) <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/opec">OPEC </a>meeting in early December are the two biggest events oil traders are watching for," Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets, said.</p>
      <p>The 16-month trade war between the world's two biggest economies has slowed global growth, prompting analysts to lower forecasts for oil demand growth and raising concerns that a supply glut could develop in 2020.</p>

      <p>China and the United States had "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level call on Saturday, state media Xinhua reported on Sunday, but it gave few other details.</p>
      <p>In a signal that policymakers are ready to act to prop up slowing growth, China's central bank unexpectedly trimmed a closely-watched lending rate on Monday, the first such cut in more than four years.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said last week it expected demand for its oil to fall in 2020, supporting a view that there is a case for the group and other producers like Russia - collectively known as 'OPEC+' - to maintain limits on production that were introduced to cope with a supply glut.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/opec">OPEC </a>and its allies are expected to discuss output policy at a meeting on Dec. 5-6 in Vienna. Their existing production deal runs until March.</p>
      <p>U.S. energy firms this week reduced the number of oil rigs operating for a fourth week in a row.</p>
