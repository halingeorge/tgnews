      <h1>Liverpool fans react as Simon Mignolet comments on exit</h1>
      <h2>Simon Mignolet is now at Club Brugge.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:15:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Simon Mignolet has revealed that he left Liverpool because he could not compete with Alisson Becker.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Belgian newspaper Het Belang van Limburg (<a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/indeed-battling-with-liverpool-star-was-difficult-for-player-doesnt-regret-decision-to-leave-anfield/">via Sport Witness</a>), Mignolet said Alisson would keep his place even if he pushed the ball into his own net. This is why the Belgian goalkeeper returned to his home country to join Club Brugge.</p>
      <p>Since his exit, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson has spent some time out injured. Adrian was brought in on a free transfer and he impressed, taking over from Mignolet as the deputy stopper at Anfield.</p>

      <p>Mignolet told Het Belang van Limburg (<a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/indeed-battling-with-liverpool-star-was-difficult-for-player-doesnt-regret-decision-to-leave-anfield/">translated via Sport Witness</a>): “Indeed. If I could really fight for my place, I might have stayed. But if I had ended up in goal if Alisson picked up injury, I would be allowed to push ten shots out of the box.</p>
      <p>“Then Alisson could immediately claim his place again. And even if he pushed the ball into his own goal, he would still retain [his place in the starting XI]. What sense did it make for me?”</p>
      <p>Here are some tweets from Liverpool fans about the 31-year-old’s comments.</p>
