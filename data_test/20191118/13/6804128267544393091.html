      <h1>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang posts picture that Arsenal fans will love ahead of Southampton clash</h1>
      <h2>The striker has been on international duty in the past week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:03:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has seemingly quashed any rumours of discontent at Arsenal by happily posing in a Gunners kit on social media.</p>
      <p>Last week, the striker shared a video of Arsenal supporters singing his name at Leicester's King Power Stadium.</p>
      <p>The clip was filmed by a fan in the concourse during the Gunners' 2-0 defeat to Brendan Rodgers' side before the international break, and Aubameyang re-posted the video on his Instagram account.</p>
      <p>His recent activity should serve as encouragement to fans amid reports that his <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> teammates are concerned about his actions on social media.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://theathletic.com/1361874/2019/11/11/ornstein-on-monday-doubts-over-aubameyang-captaincy-new-keeper-for-west-ham-and-fall-of-a-giant-poppy/">The Athletic,</a> the decision to award the striker the captaincy was not an universally popular one with everyone at the north London club.</p>
      <p>The former Dortmund forward is good friends with AFTV - formerly known as Arsenal Fan TV - contributor 'Troopz', and the Gabon international has invited the YouTube star to watch Arsenal games from the comfort of his executive box at the Emirates on several occasions.</p>
      <p>But the report claimed certain figures at the club were 'irritated' by this, and Aubameyang was reportedly asked to stop engaging with Troopz, after liking several of his posts calling for Arsenal to sack Unai Emery and sell Granit Xhaka.</p>

      <p>Aubameyang had previously hit out at those reports, writing: 'I just arrived in Gabon and heared a lot of bull... I talk with who I want and if somebody's not happy with... you already know,' followed with an emoji of a hand with the middle finger gesture.'</p>
      <p>But taking to social media on Monday, Aubameyang showed he is still committed to the Arsenal cause after posting a picture of himself wearing the club's third kit on his Instagram story with the location showing as Libreville, the capital city of Gabon.</p>
      <p>The striker captained his country to a 2-1 win over Angola on Sunday to ensure Gabon top their African Cup of Nations qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang is set to lead out Unai Emery's side against Southampton on Saturday when the Premier League returns.</p>
      <p>Arsenal sit eight points outside the top four, and victory against a struggling Saints side looks a must if the Gunners are to challenge for Champions League qualification.</p>
