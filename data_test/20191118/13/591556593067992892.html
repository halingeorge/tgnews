        <b>Smartwatches, speakers, and lamps are all in the wish list of consumers in the Latin country</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brazilian consumers are increasingly looking to buy connected devices for personal use and for the home, according to research carried out by software firm Avast. <br/><br/>According to the study, 31% of consumers in Brazil are looking to get a smartwatch. More women want a smartwatch (33% versus 31% of the males surveyed). The wishlist of Brazilian consumers also includes Alexa or Google Home smart speakers (30%), smart lamps (29%) and smart thermostats (10%). The survey polled 609 people from March to May 2019.</p>
      <p>Another Avast report published in February 2019 noted that 4 out of 10 homes in Brazil have at least one vulnerable connected device. Based on data from scanning activity across 2 million home networks, 66% of domestic routers in Brazil are vulnerable.<br/><br/>Separate research by Kaspersky, ranks second in terms of attacks to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The country concentrates 19% of the 105 million attacks against IoT devices monitored by the firm from 276,000 unique IP addresses during the first six months of the year worldwide. <br/><br/>The number is nine times higher than in the first half of 2018, during which approximately 12 million attacks originating from 69,000 IP addresses were identified.</p>
      <p>The numbers place Brazil behind China, which concentrates 30% as the country with most attacks on IoT devices and ahead of Egypt, which ranked third with 12%.</p>
