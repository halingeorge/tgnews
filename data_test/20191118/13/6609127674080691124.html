        <b>RANGERS are only behind Manchester City and Ajax in a ranking of Europe's pass masters, a new study has shown.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Swiss experts at the <a href="https://football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2019/wp274/en/">CIES Football Observatory</a> have compared the 35 top leagues across the continents to find the most dominant sides in possession.</p>

      <p>They have analysed which clubs have made the most successful passes in the opposition’s third of the field and cross-referenced that with the number of passes they have allowed in their own defensive third.</p>
      <p>And the data shows that Steven Gerrard’s<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/"> Rangers</a> are flying high in third position.</p>
      <p>The Light Blues have averaged 179 successful passes in their Premiership fixtures this term, while they have allowed just 59 in their own danger zone.</p>

      <p>However, the accolade is no guarantee of results, with English champions Manchester City - currently trailing Liverpool, Leicester and Chelsea - in the race for the EPL title topping the list with 210 passes made compared to 59 allowed. Ajax (220/64) are in second spot.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> also rank highly in seventh spot, with Neil Lennon’s side finding a team-mate 161 times in the final third and allowing just 64 from the opposition.</p>
      <p>They are one place ahead of German giants Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>Spanish giants Barcelona rank well below the Old Firm duo coming in at 18th.</p>
      <p>The stats make grim reading for Hamilton, who are remarkably rock-bottom of the table which covers the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p>Accies average just 63 passes in the attacking third, while they allow 163.</p>
