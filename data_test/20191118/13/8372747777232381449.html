      <p>BEL AIR, Md. – A bank teller in Maryland is accused of forcing his way into the home of a 78-year-old customer who had removed a large amount of money.</p>

      <p>The suspect fled the area before to deputies arrived, but investigators later identified him as 19-year-old Nathan Michael Newell, a teller at the victim’s bank.</p>
      <p>“As the investigation continued, it was determined one of the victims had removed a large amount of money from the bank,” wrote the sheriff’s office. “Detectives gained information identifying a teller at the bank as a the suspect.”</p>
      <p>Newelll was arrested on Nov. 13 and charged with home invasion, robbery, 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burglary, and 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> degree assault.</p>
      <p>The residents who were attacked in the home invasion both suffered injuries. Medics treated the woman at the scene, but the man had to be transported to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.</p>
