      <p>Honor V30 design confirmed in a leaked press images<br/>4.2 (84.44%) 9 votes</p>
      <p>We are just a week away to see one of the great releases that 2019 has left. We are talking about the Honor V30, which presumably will be known in global markets as Honor View 30. Now, we can see the design of the smartphone in all its splendor, thanks to the press images that have just been leaked.</p>
      <p>At an event scheduled in China, on November 26th, the new Honor V30 will be officially presented. The company has guarded all the information about this device with suspicion, although the leaks have been making its own throughout the last weeks. Now, the Indian website <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-v30-press-render-design-punch-hole-dual-selfie-camera-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a> has uploaded the first press images of the Honor V30. Although they do not have the desirable quality, in them we can see many details.</p>
      <h3>dual punch-hole for the front camera and a rectangular module for the rear one.</h3>

      <p>In these filtered images we can see a device that barely has frames, and that confirms its dual punch-hole shaped front camera, much like the Galaxy S10 Plus. The rear we find a rectangular module for the rear camera, which reveals a design similar to what we have seen with the Samsung Galaxy M30s. In addition, a V30 casing was recently leaked that also revealed this design, which could reach up to four rear cameras, in the V30 Pro variant.</p>
      <p>There are no details about these cameras. Although the latest rumors claim that the V30 will arrive with a 60-megapixel main sensor. It seems that it will have a fingerprint sensor located on one side. And that Honor will dispense with the 3.5 mm headphone jack. At the bottom edge, you can see the USB-C charging port with the microphone. The SIM tray and the speaker grill. The images could confirm at least two color variants, orange and blue.</p>
      <h3>Honor V30 specifications</h3>
      <p>As we say, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Honor">Honor</a> is keeping most of the information in this device away from the press eyes, but everything seems to indicate that it will arrive with a powerful Kirin 990 processor and that it will be the first of the firm to offer 5G connectivity. It could also arrive with a 4,000mAh battery with fast charging of 22.5W. And that it works with MagicUI 3 based on Android 10. It will arrive with an Honor V30 Pro variant. With four cameras and a battery that could reach 4,500 mAh.</p>
