      <h1>Wolves man Diogo Jota denied first Portugal goal by Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
      <h2>Wolves attacker Diogo Jota’s second game for Portugal would have brought his first international goal had it not been for Cristiano Ronaldo.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:36:29+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Jota’s close-range volley in Luxembourg was heading over the line.</p>
      <p>However, Ronaldo intervened and poked the ball in himself to deny the Wolves man his first Portugal strike, and claim his 99th for his country as Fernando Santos’ side, who won Euro 2016, sealed Euro 2020 qualification with a 2-0 victory.</p>

      <p>And the five-time Ballon d’Or winner did not have any feelings of guilt.</p>
      <p>“(There are) records to be broken. And I will break every one of them,” said Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to qualify. The target was getting our place in the finals and we managed to do so.”</p>
      <p>Rui Patricio started the game on Sunday and kept another clean sheet after the 6-0 win over Lithuania last Thursday.</p>
      <p>And Portugal ended the game with four Wolves players on the pitch as Joao Moutinho replaced Pizzi for his 120th cap, Jota came on for Andre Silva and Ruben Neves took the place of Bruno Fernandes, who scored the opener.</p>
      <p>It was the fourth time Wolves have had four players in an international team, with the third occasion being Portugal’s victory against Lithuania.</p>
