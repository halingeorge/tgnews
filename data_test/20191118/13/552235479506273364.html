      <p>A Kilmarnock mum has issued a desperate plea for her teenage daughter to come home.</p>
      <p>Shekira Horner was last seen more than 24 hours ago and her family and friends are now urging her to get in touch with them.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old was last seen heading towards Kilmarnock train station on Saturday evening, her family confirmed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Friends say the hairdressing student's phone has been switched off.</p>
      <p>Kelly Anne Horner, Shekira's mum, posted on Facebook this morning: "Still no news on Shekira.</p>
      <p>"Her phone is still off and she's not been on social media at all.</p>
      <p>"Nobody knows where she is or who she is with. Shekira just come home."</p>
      <p>Kelly told the Kilmarnock Standard: "She was last seen half 5 on Saturday heading towards Kilmarnock train station.</p>
      <p>"She said to a friend she was going to Glasgow to her uncle's which wasn't true as she wasn't going to her uncle's at all."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One friend Rachel Cruickshank: "Has anyone seen Shekira Horner?</p>
      <p>"She’s been missing for over 24 hours now, with no contact except for a text last night at 6.30pm.</p>
      <p>"Her phone is switched off and when it’s switched back on it’s only for a minute and back off again.</p>
      <p>"If anybody hears or sees anything, please contact myself or a member of kira’s family.</p>
      <p>"She’s not been on social media and hasn’t been seen since 5.30pm on Saturday. Someone must know something!</p>
      <p>"Kira if you see this, nobody is angry at you and you’re not in any trouble.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Just come home, even send a text or phone someone so we know you’re safe.</p>
      <p>"We’re all here for you beautiful, let us be there and come home. We love you so much. Get in contact please!</p>
