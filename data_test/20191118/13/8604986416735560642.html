      <h1>LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner Became a Better Leader With This 1 Simple Quote</h1>
      <h2>Before leading LinkedIn to its big Microsoft acquisition, CEO Jeff Weiner was feeling stagnant. This one idea propelled him (and Jeff Bezos) to success.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:15:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Brown</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/get-to-know-linkedin-ceo-jeff-weiner-10-facts-you-havent-heard.html">LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner calls himself "compassion driven,"</a> but it wasn't always that way --and without a key conversation, he might have never <a href="https://www.inc.com/damon-brown/this-linkedin-feature-will-radically-change-how-you-network.html">gotten LinkedIn to exponentially grow</a>, not to mention brought about the multibillion IPO and, later, acquisition by Microsoft.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, mentor Fred Kaufman gave Weiner just 11 words to totally reframe his definition of success.</p>
      <h3>Ruthlessness versus folly</h3>
      <p><a href="https://mastersofscale.com/jeff-weiner-how-to-set-the-drumbeat/">In the latest <i>Masters of Scale</i> podcast</a>, Weiner recalls being part of Yahoo's leadership and feeling stagnant in the culture. He shared his intention with consultant Kaufman: "To help expand the world's collective wisdom."</p>
      <p>Here's how Kaufman replied:</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Wisdom without compassion is ruthlessness and compassion without wisdom is folly."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Weiner says it changed his entire framework, encouraging him to join LinkedIn as CEO and to make empathy a key component of his leadership.</p>
      <h3>Wisdom without compassion</h3>
      <p>Weiner's revelation is <a href="https://mastersofscale.com/jeff-weiner-how-to-set-the-drumbeat/">similar to titan Jeff Bezos's early lesson</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>My grandfather looked at me, and, after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, "Jeff, one day you'll understand that it's harder to be kind than clever."</blockquote>
      <p>You can be brilliant, but people won't be able to <i>hear</i> you if your intention is foggy. Are you trying to change the world or change the people? Changing the world is easy, but changing individuals--motivating them rather than scolding them--is true leadership.</p>
      <h3>Compassion without wisdom</h3>
      <p>Empathy is just as useless without insight, clarity, and strategy. I talk about it in my latest book, <i><a href="https://amzn.to/32XuG9x">Bring Your Worth: Level Up Your Creative Power, Value &amp; Service to the World</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>Base your worth only on what the world needs, then congratulations: You're a starving artist. This is perhaps the saddest outcome, as there is no relationship between the quality of your work and your actually [sacrificing yourself]. They are not inversely proportional.</blockquote>
      <p>This means if someone you lead is stuck in a hole, then you aren't helping by jumping in the hole with them. You give them support--and you can best support them by lending a hand, not by identifying with them to the point of losing your own footing.</p>
      <p>Carry both wisdom and compassion, though, and you have the chemistry to lead well.</p>
