      <p>The entry and exit points of three Delhi Metro stations near Parliament have been reopened after a brief closure on Monday due to the ongoing protest by JNU students, authorities said.</p>
      <p>“Entry or exit at Udyog Bhawan, Patel Chowk and Central Secretariat have been opened. Trains are halting at all three stations. Entry/exit gates for Lok Kalyan Marg are still closed and trains will not be halting at the station,” the DMRC tweeted.</p>
      <p>Thousands of Jawaharlal Nehru University students, carrying placards and chanting slogans, marched towards Parliament on the first day of the Winter Session, but were stopped by police around half a kilometre from the institute’s campus in south Delhi.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the entry and exit points of the three stations near the Parliament have been shut down temporarily on Monday, due to the ongoing JNU protest.</p>
      <p>“As advised by Delhi Police, trains are not halting at Udyog Bhawan and Patel Chowk. Exit/Entry gates for Udyog Bhawan, Patel Chowk and Central Secretariat have been closed temporarily,” the DMRC tweeted.</p>
