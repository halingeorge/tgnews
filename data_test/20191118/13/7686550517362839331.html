      <h2>Sion Davies fractured his right femur amid distressing scenes</h2>

      <p>A Welsh rugby match had to be abandoned after a teenage player suffered a horrific injury.</p>
      <p>Sion Davies fractured the femur in his right thigh during an under-14 match between his club Ammanford and Burry Port.</p>
      <p>He had chased an opponent and dived to make a tackle in an effort to prevent a try when he collided with a goal post.</p>
      <p>His father Talfan Davies said: "Sion was chasing the lad at full speed and managed to tackle him around the waist in front of the post.</p>
      <p>"As the boy, who was bigger and powerful, was going to score the try he twisted and Sion, who is a little 13-year-old, was swung around with the momentum seeing him hit an upright.</p>
      <p>"There was a protective pad on the post but Sion hit it with force. It was a freak accident, a whiplash injury.</p>
      <p>"The crowd knew it was a bad one and you could hear the oohs and aahs from people."</p>
      <p>The match was abandoned as the seriousness of the injury quickly became clear.</p>
      <p>"We could see it was nasty and Sion's leg was out of line," said Mr Davies.</p>

      <p>"Burry Port coach Phil Watts is a paramedic and was fantastic. There was also a guy there named Grant who happened to be from the Air Ambulance Service.</p>
      <p>"Sion was quickly covered in blankets and people fetched hot water bottles to help keep him warm.</p>
      <p>"There was a waiting time for a land ambulance so an air ambulance came from Welshpool.</p>
      <p>"The crew were on the scene for about half an hour after it arrived. They drugged Sion up so he was out and put his leg back in line.</p>
      <p>"They were going to fly him to hospital but, amazingly, Sion wasn't in pain.</p>
      <p>"Luckily, it had gone so it was decided to transport him to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen by road."</p>

      <p>Sion was detained and was due to have the femur pinned and plated in an operation on Monday.</p>
      <p>Dad Talfan, who is physical education teacher at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Ammanford, where Sion is a pupil and was the school of Wales' record try-scorer Shane Williams, said: "I'm used to dealing with injuries in my job but yesterday was a different role because it was my son.</p>
      <p>"You don't see this type of injury too often and I was slightly emotional but the people dealing with it were so level-headed.</p>

      <p>"The service provided by the air ambulance, the Welsh Ambulance Service, the National Health Service and staff at the hospital has been excellent.</p>
      <p>"We will be paying a visit to the air ambulance base to thank staff when Sion is fit enough, and I will be making a donation to the Welsh Air Ambulance Charitable Trust which provides this vital service.</p>
      <p>"It's important people recognise and support it because it really is fantastic and it's funded by the public."</p>
      <p>Mr Davies also paid tribute to Sion's club coach Gareth Potter, a WRU hub officer who is also defence coach of Indigo Group Welsh Premiership club Llandovery and was performance analyst at the Scarlets for nearly 11 years.</p>
      <p>"Gareth's support and care for Sion was first-class - he was lying on the floor with him for an hour and a half."</p>
