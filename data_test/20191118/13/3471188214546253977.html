      <h1>[Update: Pricing] Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10+ is coming in a Star Wars Special Edition</h1>

      <p>Two of the best-known owners of Galaxy and Droid franchises have teamed up to bring a pretty special device to market at the tail end of the year, with Lucasfilm and Samsung announcing the <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> Special Edition of the Galaxy Note 10+.</p>
      <p>The special promotional version of the Note 10+ seems more Sith than Skywalker (maybe there’s something in that), with a black and red accented Note 10+, red S Pen, embossed leather case, Star Wars themed Galaxy Buds and a metal badge.</p>
      <p>It’ll be available in December – and yes, it’s coming to Australia for $1,999. Those interested will have the opportunity to pre-order the device from the Samsung Online Store, JB Hi-Fi, and Harvey Norman online stores from November 25.</p>
      <p>We have to admit, for a fan of both Android and Star Wars (so all of you, we assume), this is a very desirable package. The Galaxy Note 10+ is one of the best devices released this year and a generation of fans is awaiting the final installment of the Skywalker saga.</p>
      <p>The special edition Note 10+ will be coming to Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Korea, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UAE, UK and USA as well.</p>
