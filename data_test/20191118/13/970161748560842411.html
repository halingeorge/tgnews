      <p>Joey Essex has revealed just how hard it was existing just on one small meal of rice and beans a day on I’m A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>As the 2019 cohort got to grips with the Australian jungle after landing in the bush last night, Joey of the jungle opened up on his own time.</p>
      <p>The Towie star placed fourth in the 2013 series of the ITV show and admits the hardest part was the lack of food.</p>

      <p>In fact, he came close to eating the wild vegetation in order to cure the hunger pangs, as he saw his weight plummet during his time.</p>
      <p>‘I’m a big eater, I remember finding myself eating orange skins,’ Joey said on Loose Women on Monday.</p>

      <p>‘I was about to start eating leaves. I lost about 2.5st over three weeks.’</p>
      <p>While he became super lean over the weeks, he added their meal of rice and beans once a day was the norm as campmates failed to win enough challenges to enjoy the cooked meals the Dingo Dollars provide.</p>

      <p>Speaking about this year’s gang of contestants, the panel joked James Haskell would be eating five chickens a day, as Joey said: ‘He’s going to struggle, he looks like a big eater.’</p>
      <p>Last night the contestants were tasked with jumping out of a helicopter and scaling a skyscraper to talk along a plank.</p>
      <p>Not for the faint of heart.</p>
      <p>For the reality star, though, Joey admitted that first challenge goes by in a whirlwind.</p>
      <p>‘Everything is so unexpected, from the minute you leave, you look back and you’re on the boat, the next moment you’re jumping out of the helicopter,’ he reminisced.</p>

      <p>‘It’s all a bit of a whirlwind, you don’t know what’s going on.’</p>

      <p>And he’s pretty proud of Caitlyn Jenner’s guts, who, to Joey, ‘don’t look scared at all jumping out of the helicopter’.</p>
      <p>You can brave Keeping Up With The Kardashians, you can jump out of a chopper.</p>
      <p>‘Jumping out of the helicopter was something else, I would never do it again…unless I was pushed,’ Joey continued to muse.</p>
      <p>‘You’re on TV, million people watching, can’t mug myself off can I?’</p>
