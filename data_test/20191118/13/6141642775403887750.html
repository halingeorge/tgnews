      <h2>The Lib Dems are hoping to take this seat at the fourth time of trying.</h2>

      <p>The constituency of St Albans, which Jo Swinson visited on Monday, is one of the Liberal Democrats’ top targets in the country.</p>
      <p>A swing of 5.4% would see the Lib Dems take it from the Conservatives – the sort of swing that would hand the Lib Dems around half a dozen other Tory seats in southern England.</p>
      <p>But to win St Albans they will need to defeat Anne Main, who has represented the seat for the Tories since 2005.</p>
      <p>And Ms Main has seen off a number of attempts to beat her, including close races with the Lib Dems in both 2010 and 2017.</p>
      <p>At the 2017 election she got 43% of the vote, while her Lib Dem challenger finished on 32%.</p>
      <p>Labour came third with 23%.</p>

      <p>This year it will almost certainly be a two-horse race, however, between the Tories and Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem candidate is Daisy Cooper, who stood for the seat in 2017.</p>
      <p>Also standing this time are Labour, Green and independent candidates.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party has pulled out, but Brexit could still play a key role in the contest.</p>
      <p>The area covered by the local authority of St Albans – which includes most of the St Albans parliamentary constituency – voted 62.7% Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.</p>
      <p>This was the 29th highest Remain vote in the country.</p>
      <p>Anne Main campaigned for Leave in the referendum – something the Liberal Democrats will hope counts against her on polling day, as it seemed to do at the 2017 election when there was an 8.7% swing in St Albans from the Conservatives to the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>A similar swing at this election would see Ms Main beaten.</p>
