      <p>Calling off Delhi's infamous Odd-Even Scheme, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced this decision on Monday, claiming that the skies were clear now. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, he said that there was no need for the scheme as the skies had cleared. Kejriwal has maintained that the current state of air pollution in the national capital was mainly due to stubble burning.</p>

      <h3>Kejriwal's compares stubble burning and AQI</h3>
      <p>Previously on Sunday, Kejriwal had drawn a clear comparison between the rising AQI and the burning of stubble on farms. His tweet came in reply to another tweet by DDC Delhi Vice-Chairperson Jasmine Shah. Shah had explained that the air quality index (AQI) levels have come down to moderate levels in most parts of Delhi since the fires in Punjab and Haryana have now reduced.</p>

      <h4>Current AQI levels</h4>
      <p>Delhi's air quality had improved on Monday after being in 'Severe' category for five consecutive days. Currently, Delhi's overall AQI is at 177, falling in the unhealthy category. Meanwhile, Gurgaon recorded an AQI of 138 (moderate), while Ghaziabad 231, Noida 212 and Greater Noida 204. Experts said strong winds due to western disturbance has helped dispersed pollutants in Delhi-NCR and other parts of north India.</p>

      <h4>SC slams Centre and state govt for poor AQI</h4>
      <p>Supreme Court, taking upon the issue, recently criticised the Centre over deteriorating air quality in Delhi and asked the government to find a solution to the problem of air pollution. It asked the Centre to explore Hydrogen based fuel technology to find a solution to reduce air pollution in North India &amp; Delhi-NCR. It had also slammed the Kejriwal government's Odd-even scheme ordering the Delhi govt to file its response citing data based on the previous exercise, on stopping of private cars as against allowing 2&amp;3 wheelers and taxis.</p>

      <h4>Odd-Even Scheme</h4>
      <p>Under the Kejriwal government's scheme which was in implementation during November 5-15, , non-transport four-wheeled vehicles with registration numbers ending with an odd digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) were not allowed on the roads on November 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14. Similarly, vehicles with registration numbers ending with an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) were not allowed on the roads on November 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15. Violations of the odd-even rule invited a fine of Rs 4,000.</p>
