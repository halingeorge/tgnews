      <h2>Chas and Paddy recently had a daughter together</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:10:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Rodrigues</a></address>
      <p>Actress Lucy Pargeter, who plays <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-chas-dingle/">Chas Dingle</a> in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>, has hinted her alter ego will split from boyfriend Paddy Kirk in the future.</p>
      <p>After a terrible time last year losing their baby daughter Grace, the couple were finally brought some happiness as their <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-confirms-baby-twist-as-chas-gives-birth-in-pub-toilets/">daughter Eve was born</a> last month.</p>
      <p>However, despite their joy at having a newborn, it looks like there could be trouble ahead for the pair.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.insidesoap.co.uk/">Inside Soap</a>, Lucy hinted Chas and Paddy could be heading for a break-up.</p>
      <p>She said: "Once it's seen that an audience likes a couple together, then there's nothing better than to see them possibly split, then rejoin.</p>
      <p>"So who knows what the powers that be have planned!"</p>
      <p>She added: "At the moment they seem to be doing okay. I think they'll be strong and open."</p>
      <p>Lucy then went onto discuss how the arrival of little Eve could bring some turbulence into their relationship.</p>
      <p>She said: "A new baby in any relationship is bound to be a test, but I think Chas and Paddy will support each other through it. Hopefully it will go smoothly for them."</p>
      <p>Since <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoiler-chas-and-paddys-baby-dies-grace-dingle/">the birth and death of baby Grace</a>, the couple have managed to form a strong partnership.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Lucy continued: "I think it's cemented them more.</p>
      <p>"They experienced an awful event and then shared being pregnant again, and welcomed a healthy baby into the world.</p>
      <p>"I think it either makes you stronger or tears you apart. They're a lot stronger now than they were before Grace."</p>
      <p>Although things seem to be going well with her with Paddy, Chas's relationship with her cousin and business partner <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-charity-dingle/">Charity</a> appears to be falling apart.</p>

      </p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-moses-kidnapped-charity-panic/">Charity's son Moses was kidnapped</a> whilst he was supposed to be in the care of Chas's brother Cain, Charity was left furious.</p>
      <aside>Once it's seen that an audience likes a couple together, then there's nothing better than to see them possibly split, then rejoin.</aside>
      <p>Although the little boy was eventually returned unharmed, Charity blamed Cain and Chas's son <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-aaron-dingle/">Aaron</a> for getting Moses wrapped up in their criminal activities.</p>
      <p>With Chas defending her brother and son, Charity was left furious with her and their relationship seemingly unfixable.</p>
