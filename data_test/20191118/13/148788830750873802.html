      <p>First up, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6eP1YLLSI&amp;feature=emb_title">ScreenCrush</a> scoured every frame of the second episode of <b><i>The Mandalorian</i></b>, and there are some interesting Easter eggs and nods to other Star Wars media to take note of. For example, those bounty hunters who attack Mando early on in the episode are the same species as Bossk, the lizard bounty hunter wearing a yellow pilot suit in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>.</p>

      <p>Next up, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq49o5LhdGM&amp;feature=emb_title">Tested</a> crew had a visit with paper engineer Matthew Reinhart at his studio, where he has created award-winning pop-up books, including the recently released <i>Star Wars: The Ultimate Pop-Up Galaxy</i>. See how these pop-up books are much more complex than the ones you grew up with as a kid, and get a look at some of the prototypes he’s working on for the future.</p>
