      <p>Michelle Keegan's fans have commented on her looking strikingly different in her latest <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> photo.</p>
      <p>The actress, who shot to fame in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> , posed for a pouty selfie on Monday wearing thick layers of make-up and and a very sultry expression.</p>
      <p>The glamorous look was completed by Michelle, 32, slipping into a cleavage enhancing leather corset that featured a zip-up front and waist cinching belt.</p>
      <p>She wore her brunette hair in thick tumbling waves and added a pair of diamante drop earrings to complete her makeover.</p>

      <p>Natural beauty Michelle uploaded the photo to her social media using a checklist as the caption: "Make Up &amp; hair did, Beauty light, Dog upstaging me."</p>
      <p>Her husband Mark Wright was clearly a fan as he responded with a single flame emoji to show his appreciation.</p>
      <p>"How can anyone be this fit?!" another of Michelle's fans gushed in the comments.</p>
      <p>Although some of her followers questioned if the Our Girl star was looking a little different.</p>

      <p>"Blimey this looks nothing like you!!" exclaimed one.</p>
      <p>"What happened?" another wanted to know.</p>
      <p>Others compared Michelle's glamorous look to that of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> judge Nicole Scherzinger, who often favours a red lip, big hair and false eyelashes.</p>

      <p>After growing up in the public eye, Michelle has always strongly denied having any work done to her face.</p>
      <p>Though in May this year it was revealed that she had a little help in the dental department to achieve her good looks.</p>
      <p>Michelle and hubby Mark were both reported to be fans of ‘invisalign’ treatment, which straightens teeth using an almost invisible brace and costs up to £5000.</p>

      <p>The former Corrie star has been rumoured to have undergone Rhinoplasty in the past, which she has always laughed off.</p>
      <p>Michelle previously said: "I like the fact people point out they think I’ve had a nose job.</p>
      <p>"They think I’ve had new cheeks, a new chin – but I haven’t and I don’t think I ever would, if I’m being honest.</p>
      <p>"I’m scared it’ll go wrong!"</p>
