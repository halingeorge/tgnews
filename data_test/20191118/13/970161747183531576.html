      <p>A mother was left terrified after a dozen strangers turned up to her house in one evening expecting sex with her.</p>
      <p>Without her knowing, her boyfriend had posted nude photos online along with her Birmingham address on sex websites.</p>
      <p>Builder Darren Rowe, 49, secretly took the images without her consent and uploaded them using a customer’s wifi.</p>
      <p>He has now been prosecuted and received a suspended sentence.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-three Sharon, who did not give her full name, said: ‘You don’t expect the man that you love, who says he loves you, to try and destroy you.</p>
      <p>‘You’ve got to get your head around the fact that potentially thousands of people have seen those pictures of you.</p>

      <p>Rowe, from Rowley Regis, was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence after admitting two counts of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress at Wolverhampton Crown Court.</p>
      <p>His 39-year-old victim told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-50420677">BBC</a> she was ‘disgusted’ by what she believes is a lenient punishment.</p>
      <p>Over a four-month period in summer 2017, around 35 men came to her house, she said.</p>
      <p>At first, her partner claimed the photos had been posted by one of her friends, but police uncovered the truth.</p>
      <p>Customer services assistant Sharon said: ‘The police think he wanted to play the hero, whereas I think he had certain fetishes, which I’m not interested in.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I believe he put me in danger for his own enjoyment and I would encourage any other woman going through something like this to report it.</p>
      <p>‘I loved this man unconditionally, and for the man you love to try and destroy you mentally is something that you don’t ever get over.</p>
      <p>‘You learn to live with it daily unfortunately, but time is a good healer. If anyone is going through this, I beg you to speak out, you are not alone.’</p>
      <p>PC Lee Newell, of West Bromwich CID, said: ‘This has been a long and complex case.</p>
      <p>‘But our investigations revealed that the only person linked to an email address used to transmit the material was in fact Rowe.</p>

      <p>‘His victim has suffered a distressing onslaught of online abuse. But following this conviction we now wish her well for the future.’</p>
