      <h1>‘Disappointment’ plays ‘big role’ in Tottenham player’s difficult season – And it may get worse</h1>

      <p>For years, the Danish sport media have been waiting for Christian Eriksen to get the big move they feel he deserves.</p>
      <p>It’s not that Tottenham isn’t considered a big club in Denmark, but more that they’ve longed to see their compatriot at Barcelona or Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Barca appeared to be the first choice, with any mild claim in the Catalan media taken and twisted for a Danish audience into something more convincing than it ever was.</p>
      <p>Then a move to Real Madrid was thought likelier, and the whole process began again.</p>
      <p>Eriksen made it clear he quite fancied a move, and the assumption was it would just be a matter of time. That may still be the case, but there was no fight for him in the summer window and <a href="https://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/">Ekstra Bladet</a> puts his poor season down to that.</p>
      <p>The ‘disappointment’ of a failed transfer has played a ‘big role’ in Eriksen’s struggles for form at Spurs.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for him, there’s a suggestion things could get worse. Despite him being on the verge of free agent status, there’s still a lack of serious interest.</p>
      <p>Ekstra Bladet has spoken to journalists from Spain, Italy, England and Germany to ask about transfer interest, and haven’t got the replies they’ll have hoped for.</p>
      <p>Carlos Forjanes of Spanish newspaper AS is quoted as saying: <i>“People are not very interested in Eriksen. Not even when he played the Champions League final.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I never thought Real Madrid fans felt it was necessary to pick him up instead of Pogba. I think he is undervalued in Spain.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Alexandra Bocci of Italy’s Gazzetta dello Sport was a little more optimistic, but still couldn’t speak of specific interest: <i>“Everyone knows that Christian Eriksen is a good player. As I consider it, only Juventus and Inter can speak for him in Italy. Juventus has the money and position in Europe. And so they have brought in many free-transfer players in the past.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Whether Eriksen can be in Serie A next summer when the contract expires is too early to say right now. Personally, I think he chooses another country to play in.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Gary Jacob of The Times said: <i>“In England, he is a good player. But he is not a great player who can appear for the biggest clubs. He delivers good spells, but then he disappears for periods.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I don’t see any English clubs other than Manchester United who may be interested in him. It’s hard to see him at Manchester City. And I can’t see him in Liverpool at all.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Stephan von Knocks of Kicker talked down a move to Germany: <br/>“In the Bundesliga, I</p>

      <p>would consider that only Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund can pay what Christian Eriksen demands when he is free next summer.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“No other German club is likely to be attractive to Christian Eriksen, who is likely to be confident of playing the Champions League each season. To be honest, I don’t think the chances of a move to the Bundesliga are particularly high.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Things aren’t looking so exciting for the Tottenham player.</p>
