      <h1>Separation of conjoined twins: A matter of national pride</h1>

      <p><b>Okaz</b><br/><br/>The successful surgical separation of Libyan Siamese twins at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh last Thursday was carried out by a large Saudi medical team led by Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah.<br/><br/>The entire Saudi community along with media and social networking sites awaited news of the outcome of the operation, which reinforces the Kingdom’s position as a humanitarian nation that has made giant strides in the area of medical and scientific achievement.<br/><br/>The Kingdom has made significant progress in the medical field and some of its specialized hospitals can compete with world-class hospitals. Saudi doctors have become distinguished experts in various specialties.<br/><br/>Of course, Arab countries and other countries in the region have made medical achievements in some fields. However, the separation of conjoined twins in particular is now associated with the name of the Kingdom due to the many successful operations that have been carried out here.<br/><br/>The successful surgical separation of conjoined twins has become an integrated national medical project managed by cadres who have gained much expertise and skill.<br/><br/>The Kingdom’s remarkable achievement in this field has become a reliable reference in global medical circles and has become a matter of immense pride as a national achievement.<br/><br/>The media has also given prominent coverage, especially in those countries that have sent conjoined twins to the Kingdom for surgical separation.<br/><br/>I have written more than once about this project, highlighting that it represents a significant humanitarian initiative, which has been instrumental in creating a good reputation for the Kingdom.<br/><br/>Humanitarian work and scientific achievements that serve humanity in general, regardless of any discriminatory considerations, give the world a positive impression of the Kingdom.<br/><br/>Apart from the excellent medical team, led by Dr. Al-Rabeeah, we have a number of other teams in medical and other specializations that have made outstanding scientific achievements but these have not received the media attention that they deserve. The majority of Saudi citizens do not know about them, nor do people in other countries.<br/><br/>We must take pride in these national models and put them in their proper place and let our young people know about them so as to enable them to follow these exemplary role models.</p>
