      <p>As <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/titans-tv/"><i>Titans</i></a> wraps its second season, a new report claims to have major details about the original plans for the Season 1 finale, which were altered when the series was renewed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thegww.com/titans-heres-what-was-supposed-to-happen-in-the-scrapped-season-1-finale/">Geeks Worldwide</a> reports that <a href="https://www.cbr.com/titans-season-2-premiere-season-1-finale/">parts of the Season 2 premiere</a> came from the original Season 1 finale, which ended on an abrupt cliffhanger as the team confronted Raven's father Trigon. Additionally, the report claims that two episodes planned for Season 1 were dropped, lowering the final episode count from 13 to 11.</p>

      <p>The plans scrapped from the Season 1 finale included the return of the Doom Patrol, who had appeared in the fourth episode of the DC Universe series. Negative Man was going to create a portal to reunite the Titans with the incarnation of the DCU team from their own spinoff series rather than the one seen earlier in Season 1, explaining away the continuity discrepancies between the two series.</p>

      <p>As for the Titans themselves, Dick Grayson was slated to make his debut as Nightwing using a repurposed Batman suit, while Starfire took on a more comic book accurate costume to join the team in battle against Trigon, closing out the season. Instead, with the shortened episode order, the series ended its story abruptly, saving the Nightwing reveal for the end of Season 2, while the Doom Patrol plans were dropped entirely.</p>
