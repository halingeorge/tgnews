        <b>England head coach has his say on Scotland's World Cup campaign and discusses the possibility of Japan joining Six Nations</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eddie Jones has claimed Scotland "possibly got their physical conditioning wrong" during their ill-fated World Cup campaign.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/50457224">BBC</a>, the England head coach suggested that a 32-3 warm-up loss to France hinted at problems Gregor Townsend's team would face during the tournament.</p>
      <p>Jones said: "We have great respect for the Scottish team and they way they play. Where they came unstuck at the World Cup is possibly they got their physical conditioning wrong."</p>
      <p>Townsend had claimed ahead of the tournament that Scotland would be the "<a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/scotland/gregor-townsend-thrilled-with-duncan-taylor-ahead-of-world-cup-tilt-1-4999694">fittest at the World Cup</a>", but Jones felt otherwise.</p>
      <p>"The [game against France] gives you a pretty good indication of where a team is going to be. They looked like they had over-ran, but that's a judgement from a long way away," the 59-year-old added.</p>
      <p><b>Where next for Scotland?</b><br/><br/>Jones believes Scotland need to take inspiration from Japan - who recorded their first victory over the Scots with a 28-21 win in their crunch Pool A match - to try and become the "best small team in the world".</p>
      <p>Jones, who coached the Brave Blossoms between 2012 and 2015, praised the work being done by Townsend but offered suggestions on where they could improve,</p>
      <p>"Gregor's got them back playing how a Scotland side should play. [A lack of size] makes it difficult but you can have one-off success like Japan have had.</p>
      <p>"You've got to pool all your resources into being the best small team in the world."</p>
      <p>Highlighting the set-piece as an area of improvement, Jones continued: "You [must] look at everything you do, at how you can win ball quickly - particularly from set-piece.</p>
      <p>"You look at how you can win the ball quickly from the breakdown and you need a consistent programme for four years to be at your best to do that.</p>
      <p>"You have to play quick, you have to have a varied attack and it takes a lot of cohesion to play that way."</p>

      <p><b>Japan in the Six Nations?</b><br/><br/>Jones also admitted Japan's performance in the World Cup - where they advanced to the quarter-finals before being overcome by eventual winners South Africa - had helped them stake a claim for greater involvement in the northern hemisphere's programme of games.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the World Cup the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-7649317/Japan-lined-SHOCK-Six-Nations-invite-World-Rugby-bid-capitalise-World-Cup-success.html">Daily Mail</a> claimed that plans had been privately mooted to invite Japan, currently ranked eighth in the world, to the Six Nations after The Rugby Championship - the southern hemisphere's equivalent tournament involving Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - had proposed a delay of up to five years before sanctioning the Brave Blossoms' involvement.</p>
      <p>"I think ten internationals a year [in the northern hemisphere] is about right," Jones said, before warning: "Increasing the Six Nations would mean taking away from somewhere else.</p>
      <p>"I'd bring Japan in for bye-weeks, so they'd play two games over the next three or four years to prove they're strong enough to compete consistently."</p>
      <p>The Six Nations, originally a British-based tournament featuring the four home nations, was widened to include France in 1910 and Italy in 2000.</p>
      <p>More recently, there has been talk of extending the competition once more to include Georgia or Russia - possibly at Italy's expense - but no formal proposals have been put forward.</p>
