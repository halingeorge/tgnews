      <p><b>Muscat:</b> Indian expat Dhanya Ratheesh has paid a musical tribute to Oman on the occasion of 49th National Day by performing a patriotic song on the traditional Indian musical instrument veena.<br/><br/>Dhanya, who is a talented veena artiste, released the special composition on her YouTube channel. She chose the powerful medium of music to communicate a message of love and gratitude to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said and its citizens on the occasion of 49th National Day.<br/><br/>Commenting on her tribute, she said, “I have chosen to express my love and gratitude to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said and Oman on its 49th National Day by performing music on veena which is among the oldest and most special of Indian musical instruments. National Day to me is a day of celebration and we are fortunate to be blessed to be living in this wonderful country we call home.”<br/><br/>Dhanya, who started her musical journey at a tender age of seven years in Kerala, has won several awards in the inter school-college competitions. One of her greatest achievement was to receive the top prize from iconic playback singer Dr.K J Yesudas for winning the All Kerala Augustine Memorial competition, named after his father, and conducted by Sri Poornatrayeesha Sangeetha Sabha.</p>
      <p>She is currently very active on Facebook and YouTube platforms promoting veena among the youth and elderly alike across the globe. Dhanya has been performing in several musical stage shows in Oman for the past few years.</p>
