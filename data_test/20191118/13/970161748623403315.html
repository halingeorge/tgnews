        <b>Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) and Callum ‘Halfway’ Highway’s (Tony Clay) road to romance in EastEnders has been anything but smooth but, nonetheless, the pair persevered, and thus they’ve formed a special relationship as a result. However, further problems are set to ensue for the duo’s relationship in tonight’s episode — and Callum’s desire to join the police is seemingly the cause.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Almost two weeks ago, Ben and Callum <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-makes-a-huge-gesture-to-callum-highway-10887870/">made a commitment to one another</a>, confirming that they are now boyfriends. However, not long afterwards, Callum dropped something of a bombshell when he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-horrified-as-callum-highway-reveals-he-wants-to-join-the-police-11066923/">revealed to his lover that he wants to join the police force</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s safe to say that Ben was devastated, as he pondered what to do for the best. Mind you, considering his penchant for dodgy deals, it’s no wonder he’s conflicted!</p>
      <p>The young man’s problems are set to pursue tonight, as Martin (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) discovers Callum’s desire to become a cop, and he wastes little time in winding him up about it.</p>

      <p>Later, Ben realises how much his boyfriend is actually considering the police force as his chosen profession, and he’s even more worried.</p>
      <p>Conflicted, Ben reveals that he’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-dumps-callum-highway-10961716/">not a hundred percent certain they could remain together</a> if Callum follows through with his dreams of becoming a cop.</p>
      <p>Callum’s hurt by Ben’s words, and leaves as a result.</p>
      <p>After everything they’ve been through, it’s clear that Ben and Callum are meant for one another. Having said that, both characters are cut from a very different cloth — and having a police officer as a boyfriend is something of a conflict of interest for Ben considering his dodgy profession. Similarly, having a criminal as a lover is a conflict for Callum — so the pair have found themselves in quite the predicament, that’s for sure!</p>
      <p>Will <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/eastenders-spoilers-callum-highway-has-a-huge-proposition-for-ben-mitchell-10961927/">love triumph</a>?</p>
