      <p>After<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/coronation-street-spoilers-liz-mcdonald-leaving-beverley-callard-quits-11174202/"> confirming she would be hanging up her hat</a> as Liz McDonald on Coronation Street, Beverley Callard has gone one step further in revealing her character’s fate.</p>
      <p>With show bosses promising that she will ‘exit with a bang’, the icon of Weatherfield has been central to some huge storylines in the show, not least of all her explosive marriage to husband Jim.</p>
      <p>Now all eyes are on just how Liz will make her big exit.</p>
      <p>While Beverley today said she is in the dark about the details, she’s been reassured by Corrie bosses she won’t be killed.</p>

      <p>‘I did think, at 60, I’ve been on for 30 years but Corrie is 60, they’re going to kill me,’ she said on Loose Women today.</p>
      <p>‘They said they’re not and I don’t know what [the story] is yet, I truly don’t, but they said she’ll go with a bang.</p>

      <p>‘So I’m quite looking forward to that.’</p>
      <p>While she ‘certainly won’t be stealing her clothes’, Liz hinted the McDonald clan may come back together in a big way for her send-off.</p>
      <p>‘I do hope they do,’ she teased, before adding: ‘As actors we have no say in that at all.’</p>

      <p>Even if characters do kick the bucket there is no saying their departure from a soap is permanent, and Beverley made it clear she had no intention to retire.</p>
      <p>When it comes to a Corrie return, well, the lady said it best herself.</p>
      <p>‘I mean, I would never say never,’ she teased, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>
      <p>‘But I’m 62; earlier in the year I was doing three jobs at the same time and people say “well, there is no work for women in this industry”, we have to make our own…we have to prove to everybody we can do it.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll never retire because you get a script and think “This is amazing, I want to bring this role to life.”’</p>
      <p>Never say never, eh?</p>

      <p>Earlier today Beverley announced her departure, after three decades on the soap.</p>
      <p>Speaking to OK Magazine, she said of her decision: ‘I was in shock, I felt totally numb. I’ve been told that Liz is going to go with one hell of a bang! I can’t wait!’</p>
      <p>The actress admitted that she had had many sleepless nights before she announced her decision to show bosses earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Her final storyline will air next year and comes amid upcoming exits for Kym Marsh (Michelle Connor), Tristan Gemmill (Robert Preston) and Lucy Fallon (Bethany Platt).</p>
      <p>Liz will be on screen until summer 2020.</p>
