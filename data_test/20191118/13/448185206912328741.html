      <p><b>Tezpur</b><b>:</b> Activists of North Assam Divyang Association (NADA) held a rally and took out a procession in Tezpur town in protest against non-fulfillment of various demands. They later staged demonstration in front of the DRDA office on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The NADA members criticized the State Government through slogans and statements written in banners and placards. Chief secretary of NADA, Utpal Bhuyan alleged that the Chief Minister had failed to fulfill their long-pending demands. They had appealed to the authority concerned many times but their demands had fallen into deaf ears. Bhuyan further added that as per the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995 and 2016, 21 categories of disabilities had been identified viz., blindness, low vision, leprosy cured, hearing impairment, locomotor disability, mental retardation, and mental illness. Persons falling under the above categories with a minimum of 40 percent disability are eligible for entitlement of all benefits provided by the government. NADA members submitted a memorandum to the Commissioner and the Director of DRDA Sonitpur on the above issues.</p>
