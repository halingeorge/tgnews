      <p>Moved by the plights of an aged man, a widower, who was shunned by his children — three sons and a daughter, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao has directed the Revenue Divisional Officer to conduct an enquiry and cancel the registration of four acres of land he had given to his daughter if it was a fit case.</p>
      <p>The Collector passed the order, when Andiappan, 80, from Periayur, presented a petition at the public grievance redressal meet here on Monday, stating that he was forced to even beg to eke out a living as his three sons and a daughter who were living separately after their marriages refused to take care of him.</p>
      <p>After his wife died 20 years ago, he had been at the mercy of their children but they had left him in the lurch after getting married. He said he gave four acres of land, which was in his wife’s name, to his only daughter Veeralakshmi, who was working as a teacher in a school at Mela Thakulam.</p>
      <p>Later, he gave another four acres of land to his daughter, believing that she would take care of him but she too had shown him the door, he said.</p>
      <p>Recently he underwent a surgery for kidney ailment at the government hospital and none of his children visited him. He could have one meal a day thanks to the free rice distributed in ration shop, he said.</p>
      <p>When he asked his daughter to return the land for his living, she beat him, he said.</p>
      <p>He also learnt that his daughter had registered the four acres of land in her husband’s name, who was the former president of the Kadambakulam Panchayat, he said.</p>
      <p>The Collector asked the RDO to conduct an enquiry after summoning the petitioner’s daughter and make arrangements for her to give at least ₹ 4,000 a month to him in coordination with the social welfare department and cancel the registration of the lands in coordination with the registration department.</p>
