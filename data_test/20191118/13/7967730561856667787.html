      <h1>'Sledgehammer to crack a walnut': $5000 bankruptcy threshold under review</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Clancy Yeates</a></address>
      <p>The government will consider lifting the minimum amount of money over which someone can be put into bankruptcy from its current level of $5000, amid concerns about aggressive tactics used by debt collectors.</p>
      <p>As banks and consumer groups joined forces to argue for a higher threshold for forced bankruptcy, federal Attorney-General Christian Porter on Monday said he has asked his department to review bankruptcy arrangements.</p>

      <p>"People with relatively small amounts of debt should not have to face being kicked out of their homes to settle amounts as low as $5000. Such action, while lawful, would seem to me to be the legal equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut," Mr Porter said.</p>
      <p>The Australian Banking Association, the Consumer Action Law Centre (CALC), Financial Counselling Australia and the Financial Rights Legal Centre and various consumer groups have written to Mr Porter urging a review of the $5000 threshold.</p>
      <p>The ABA supports a higher threshold, though it did not nominate a number, due to concerns about potential breaches of competition law. CALC has previously advocated for a $50,000 threshold.</p>

      <p>Mr Porter said the government would also need to consider any "unintended consequences" from changing bankruptcy laws, noting that some people chose bankruptcy "out of necessity."</p>
      <p>The banking industry has also revamped its guidelines, setting out steps banks must follow before they can engage debt collectors.</p>
      <p>Under the changes, banks would be required to contact customers to try to work out an alternative solution before selling the debt and banks would not sell debt that was disputed by a customer.</p>
      <p>The guidelines also say banks should not sell debt to a collector if they think it is unlikely to be repaid, and banks would need to be consulted before a debt collector can put someone into bankruptcy.</p>

      <p>ABA chief executive Anna Bligh said: “Banks are stepping up to the plate to ensure vulnerable customers are protected and supported when struggling with unsecured debt such as credit cards and personal loans.”</p>
      <p>The change comes after CALC in August found Lion Finance, a debt collector owned by ASX-listed Collection House, had made more than 500 court applications for bankruptcy in the year to June. It said other collectors made between zero and 30 applications.</p>
      <p>Collection House chairman Leigh Berkley told shareholders this month that the company had been acting "completely within the law", but it was "evaluating our stance in how we seek recovery through the legal process."</p>
      <p>Financial Rights Legal Centre CEO Karen Cox said the new guidelines should mean "small bank debts do not easily lead to homelessness and disproportionate financial loss.”</p>
