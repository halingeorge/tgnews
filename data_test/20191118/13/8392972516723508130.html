      <p>Kate Garraway squeals as she takes on her first Bushtucker trial on tonight's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>We saw the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> presenter enter the jungle last night alongside nine other famous faces including Caitlyn Jenner, Jacqueline Jossa and James Haskell.</p>
      <p>ITV shared a preview clip of tonight's trial, Bugged off, and it shows Caitlyn and Kate take on the critter-infested challenge.</p>

      <p>In the footage, Kate and Caitlyn are seen strapped down inside transparent boxes, which have been lifted in the air.</p>
      <p>They have to chuck a ball into a bucket below them and have 10 minutes to try and get as many as they can.</p>
      <aside>There's so many of them! Oh God, oh God.</aside>
      <p>However, of course, a bunch of critters will join them in the box including 30,000 cockroaches.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn says: "Oh boy... we've got lots of friends!" as the cockroaches are poured into the box.</p>
      <p>Host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> tells the pair: "That's right, lots of friends in there with you now..."</p>

      <p>Kate says: "Oh no, oh no, oh no. There's so many of them! Oh God, oh God."</p>
      <p>Kate then tries to drop one of her balls into the bucket below but fails to get it in.</p>
      <p>She says: "Oh, missed it, ah!"</p>
      <p>As the critters start crawling over her, she screams: "Ah! Oh no!"</p>
      <p>Viewers have already predicted how tonight's trial will go as they shared their thoughts on Twitter.</p>

      <p>One person said: "Kate can do it, in fact I think they will both encourage and support each other during the trial. She might get a bit nervous at the start but she will be fine."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "These two are gonna be hilarious."</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "Kate can do it. She did the plank walking in the end. @Caitlyn_Jenner will help her through it I think. Come on ladies."</p>
      <p>Last night, Kate was terrified as she walked across a 300ft high plank in one of the show's first challenges.</p>
