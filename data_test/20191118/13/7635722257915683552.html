        <b>A young man has been handed a fully suspended sentence for impeding the apprehension or prosecution of the killers of a senior Real IRA figure.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aidan O’Driscoll was shot dead after two gunmen chased him shortly after he left work in Cork city on December 7th 2016.</p>
      <p>Known as ‘The Beast', Aidan O’Driscoll was executed as part of an internal dispute between the Real IRA and the New IRA.</p>
      <p>He was targeted by two gunmen on Old Commons Road in Blackpool, a busy part of Cork city.</p>
      <p>Gardaí described the execution as “well-planned”.</p>
      <p>Two other men have already been sentenced for their roles in sourcing vehicles and destroying evidence.</p>
      <p>Today, 20-year-old Eoin Morrissey, with an unknown address, was handed a fully suspended two-year sentence for impeding the apprehension or prosecution of Mr O’Driscoll’s killers.</p>
      <p>The court heard he assisted in the disposal of a car, but only realised afterwards that it had been used in the shooting.</p>
      <p>In explaining why the court was giving him a second chance, Mr Justice Tony Hunt said the 20-year-old been easily led - and, while he’d made very bad choices, he accepted he was only 17 at the time and has responded appropriately.</p>
      <p>The judge finished by telling Eoin Morrissey there wouldn’t be another second chance if he came before him again.</p>
