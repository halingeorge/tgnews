      <p>The family of missing Leah Croucher have shared a photo of them holding her brother’s hand shortly before he died in hospital.</p>
      <p>Haydon Croucher, 24, from Milton Keynes, hanged himself nine months after his sister disappeared on her way to work in February.</p>
      <p>He was found the next morning by his mum Tracey Furness and sister Jade, before being rushed to hospital in a critical condition where he later died surrounded by family.</p>
      <p>Jade shared a picture of Haydon’s hand being held by three other hands as he lay in a hospital bed.</p>
      <p>She wrote alongside the picture: ‘Haydon, me, Mum and Dad held onto your hand until the very last moment but we will hold you in our hearts forever!</p>

      <p>‘You will always be with us until the day we meet you again. Mum and Dad might not be together but one thing that will never waver is the love they have for you their darling son!</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘We will all stick together as a unit and get through the pain with the love and support of both of our amazing stepparents Dave and Claire.’</p>
      <p>Haydon’s mum Tracey Furness also shared a heart-breaking tribute to her son, telling him: ‘Mummy loves you’.</p>
      <p>She wrote on Facebook: ‘How do I express the pain that no mother should have to endure my son my darling son Haydon.</p>
      <p>‘You mean the world to me and I cannot even begin to process the pain and heartache that I feel. My world has fallen to pieces without you.</p>
      <p>‘You were the most loving boy and the bond we had will stay with me until eternity. Giving life to you to see life go from you makes no sense. A mother should never have to bury their child!!’</p>
      <p>Tracey later described how she and Jade had found his ‘lifeless body’ and ‘tried in vain to breathe air into him’ while begging him to ‘come back’.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘An image of his beautiful lifeless face [will be] forever imprinted in our minds.</p>
      <p>‘Haydon may now have found his peace, but for me and my family we will never be the same. Suicide may end their pain in the moment, but for the families a lifetime of pain has just began.’</p>

      <p>Haydon’s father John Croucher said he had spoken to his son on November 14 to ‘reassure him we all feel the same sadness’ as they marked nine months since Leah vanished.</p>
      <p>The martial arts instructor said: ‘We promise to meet up the following day so we can face it together. Hours later police knock at the door and tell you that Haydon is fighting for his life.</p>
      <p>‘The doctors say the prognosis is bad. You sit by his bedside and watch him deteriorate by the minute. You have to say your goodbyes.What do you say in that situation?</p>
      <p>‘You tell him you love him. You reminisce about funnier times. You beg him to come back to us. Finally you have to tell him to go and be at peace. You hold him as he slips away.</p>
      <p>‘To say our hearts and minds are broken is an understatement.’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘Be at peace Haydon. If Leah is up there with you look after each other as always, until we get there. We love and miss you both terribly.’</p>
      <p>An inquest into Haydon’s death will take place in due course.</p>
      <p>Leah was last seen on Valentine’s Day this year, when she was caught on CCTV walking to her job as a financial clerk in Knowlhill, around two miles from her home.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>She never arrived at her destination, and her phone and bank account have not been touched since.</p>
      <p>During their search, police have knocked on more than 4,000 doors, searched lakes in the area and are offering a reward of £5,000 for anyone with information concerning her whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Three witnesses say they saw a girl ‘upset and crying’ on the morning she disappeared.</p>
