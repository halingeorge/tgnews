      <h1>TECNO Camon 12 first impressions and where to buy– Techjaja</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:11:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">pages/Techjaja/291142381017322</a></address>
      <p>As is the case, <a href="https://www.tecno-mobile.com/ug/home/#/">TECNO</a> followed up with a successor to the coveted <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/tecno-camon-11-pro-first-impressions-price-and-where-to-buy-from/">Camon 11</a> and now we have the Camon 12.</p>
      <p>The Camon series is its line of smartphones best known for their photography prowess and in recent times, they’ve tended to deviate towards being selfie-focused. Not to say the back camera is not capable but imagine 16MP for a selfie camera, which is the same as the rear one, only that the latter carries more lenses of 8MP and 2MP for wide-angle shots and macro photography to form the triple AI camera.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/camera-prowess-tecno-camon-12-is-coming-soon/">rumored, the Camon 12 has a larger screen to body ratio</a>, TECNO claims it is 90%, a good feat on its own but it also carries some bezels in form of a chin at the bottom and a waterdrop notch at the top.</p>

      <p>Most of the phone is screen at the front while the back with its triple AI cameras and the fingerprint scanner is mostly plastic.</p>
      <p>Actually, the design language doesn’t deviate so much from last years Camon 11 but its a different story when it comes to internals as you can see below, almost everything is an upgrade</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Display</b>: 6.52-inch HD+ (~269 ppi density)</li>
        <li><b>Front Camera</b>: 16 MP </li>
        <li><b>Rear Camera</b>: 16 MP + 8 MP + 2 MP</li>
        <li><b>OS</b>: Android 9.0 (Pie); HIOS 5.5</li>
        <li><b>Network</b>: 4G/3G/2G</li>
        <li><b>Internal Storage</b>: 64 GB</li>
        <li><b>RAM</b>: 4 GB</li>
        <li><b>Processor</b>: Mediatek MT6762 Helio P22 (12 nm)</li>
        <li><b>Battery</b>: 4000mAh</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is also powered Android P atop TECNO’s own HiOS operating system. The phone at least performed well and never experienced hiccups but more remains to be told in our upcoming review.</p>
      <h3>Any Camon 12 complaints?</h3>
      <p>Apart from the intrusive ads over its HiOS skin, the TECNO Camon 12 seems to be a worthy upgrade from last year’s model but as we said, our review will determine whether you should consider it, shortlist or go ahead and buy it, but for how much?</p>
      <h3>Price and where to buy from</h3>
      <p>The Camon 12 retails between 600,000 and 700,000 UGX at TECNO branded shops countrywide.</p>
