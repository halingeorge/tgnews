      <p>This <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> there are plenty of good TV deals around – and you may well find yourself checking out a super-cheap Polaroid TV in the sales. Then again, you might be confused about putting those words together – don't Polaroid make, you know, cameras?</p>
      <p>Yes, Polaroid pioneered instant photography several decades ago with the invention of the Polaroid camera. After the American brand's heyday, however – when digital cameras bankrupted the business – the Polaroid name is now licensed on a number of audio products, smartphone photography apps, and retro clothing.</p>
      <p>It's also now in the business of TVs. And these aren't televisions for budding photographers as much as they are for those on a tight budget.</p>
      <p>But with so many variations of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/what-size-tv-do-i-need">TV sizes</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/television/6-best-smart-tv-platforms-in-the-world-today-1120795">smart TV platforms</a>, and picture processing technologies between different sets out there, there are countless televisions you could be taking home. Why should you consider Polaroid?</p>

      <h4>Should I buy a Polaroid TV?</h4>
      <p>Polaroid occupies a similar place in the market to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/should-i-buy-a-hisense-television">Hisense</a> or Toshiba, manufacturing budget LED sets that offer big-screen panels at affordable prices. However, you'll often find Polaroid's TVs are even cheaper.</p>
      <p>In the UK, Polaroid sells a number of dirt-cheap displays through the supermarket chain Asda, with a 24-inch Polaroid Series 1 set available as low as £139 – and 49-inch 4K sets for as little as £229 – though you'll need to find one in-store rather than buying online.</p>
      <p>In the US retailer Target, you can also pick up a 32-inch 720p television for only $129.</p>
      <p>Even Polaroid's 4K sets are very much the lower end of the market – American retailer Kmart sells 55-inch UHD displays for under $500.</p>

      <p>Some Polaroid sets aren't really fully-fledged <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/television/6-best-smart-tv-platforms-in-the-world-today-1120795">smart TVs</a> in their own right – watch out for this – but come with a basic Google OS, which relies on you casting content from a smartphone or tablet. Any handy USB port in the back should let you use an actual <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/chromecast-1305399/review">Chromecast</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/amazon-fire-tv-stick-1274525/review">Amazon Fire TV stick</a> though, which might be significantly more convenient.</p>
      <p>Polaroid also manufactures TVs in sizes some brands barely bother with anymore, like 24 and 32 inch. If you're looking for a more compact television to squeeze into a bedroom, or that can be tidied away in a cupboard more easily, these may be worth a look. The hardware design also tends to be straightforward, with light plastic casing and a stripped-back UI.</p>
      <p>When we reviewed the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/polaroid-p55d600-1301011/review/3">Polaroid P55D600</a>, we praised the brand's first UHD television for its impressive picture quality right out of the box, both in native 4K and when upscaling HD/SDR content. There wasn't much optimization to be found in the set's picture settings, but there was also little need to fiddle.</p>

      <p>At this price, corners will inevitably be cut, though – we found the P55D600's dimming zones and backlighting features disappointing and inexact when trying to vary the brightness in low-light content.</p>
      <p>But for these low prices you're likely to be getting a decent picture from a Polaroid TV, as long as you don't expect too much from it.</p>
      <p>We recommend sticking with Polaroid sets in smaller sizes though, where they don't have as fierce competition from big-name rivals such as Philips or Samsung – and are still cost-effective. The lower-cost panels are likely to show their flaws more clearly on larger screens too, where the processor needs to work a lot harder to get a consistent picture out of all those pixels. But if you want a dirt-cheap 4K TV, you could do a lot worse.</p>
