      <p>Derby County have been linked with a move for Livingston striker <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-dykes-3548235">Lyndon Dykes</a> during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Reports over the weekend claimed that the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>are one of six clubs to have made an enquiry for the 24-year-old forward.</p>
      <p>Middlesbrough, Cardiff, Swansea, Bristol City and Blackburn have also been credited with an interest in the player.</p>
      <p>So who is the latest player to be <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/live-derby-county-qa-transfer-3549505">linked with a move to Pride Park</a>?</p>
      <p>Dykes was born on October 7, 1995, in the Gold Coast in Australia, stands at 6ft2” tall and plays predominantly as a striker.</p>
      <p>After growing up in Australia, Dykes toured Scotland, where his parents originate, and was signed by Queen of the South in the summer of 2016.</p>
      <p>His first goal in professional football came in his sixth game as he scored in QoS’s 3-1 win over Hibernian in the Scottish League Cup tie in August 2016.</p>
      <p>In his first season as a professional, Dykes scored just four goals in 40 appearances, but after eventually netting 22 times in 136 outings he was signed by Livingston in the summer.</p>

      <p>The 24-year-old started brightly at his new club, scored five goals in 14 appearances so far this season.</p>
      <p>His disciplinary record is an area of his game that could do with improvement. He has already accumulated five yellow cards this term, and was sent of in Livingston’s 3-1 defeat to Rangers in September.</p>
      <p>Dykes has proven that he can play in a number of positions in the final third, mainly featuring as the main striker he can also operate on either wing and in the No.10 role behind the lone frontman.</p>
