      <h1>From the Archives, 1959: Mystery flame seen in Blue Mountains</h1>
      <h2>60 years ago, several witnesses - including a birdwatcher, a fireman and RAAF staff - reported seeing a towering column of flame, hundreds of feet high, in the sky above the lower Blue Mountains.</h2>

      <p>A Hills district quarryman said last night that he and a farmer had watched a "fantastic flame" in the lower Blue Mountains area for about 1 ½ minutes yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>"It seemed to be near the Hazelbrook-Leura area and must have been hundreds of feet high," he said.</p>

      <p>The quarryman is Mr Russell White, of Blue Gum Road, Annangrove, who saw the flame with Mr T. Jasper, of Annangrove Road, Kenthurst, a well known bird watcher.</p>
      <p>At almost the same time as the two men saw the mysterious flame, a report of a possible air crash near Penrith had Sydney's emergency services alerted for half an hour.</p>

      <p>However, R.A.A.F. and Civil Aviation Department officials said no aircraft were missing or overdue.</p>
      <p>Mr White said he and Mr Jasper saw the flame from Mr Jasper's property at 11.20 a.m.</p>
      <p>
        <b>About 300ft In Height</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr White said the flame was about 300 feet in height and shot up about 20 miles west of the Kenthurst-Annangrove area.</p>
      <p>"It was a brilliant orange flame in a vertical position," Mr White said.</p>
      <p>"It was the most fantastic sight I have ever seen.</p>
      <p>"Mr Jasper rushed inside to get his binoculars but, when he came back, the flame went as quickly as it appeared.</p>
      <p>"It lasted about one and a half minutes."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Meteor Theory Discounted</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Government Astronomer, Mr H. W. Wood, said last night that, had the flame been seen for a shorter time, it could have been a very bright meteor.</p>
      <p>"Very bright meteors are visible in the daytime—in fact, I have seen one myself," Mr Wood said.</p>
      <p>"But, as the flame was seen for one and a half minutes, I would not hazard a guess as to what it was.</p>
      <p>"However, I don't think it was a space vehicle re-entering the earth. It is possible, but most unlikely."</p>
      <p>At 11.27 a.m. crew members of a Lincoln bomber on exercises from Richmond R.A.A.F. base saw what appeared to be a large ball of fire north-west of Penrith, towards the Hawkesbury Look-out.</p>

      <p>The aircraft commander, Flight-Lieut. L. Hampson, R.A.F., reported the sighting to Richmond control.</p>
      <p>Richmond officials notified Sydney police and ordered the Lincoln to search the area.</p>
      <p>At the same time, a Hercules transport on exercises in the area had suddenly lost radio contact.</p>
      <p>Then a Bankstown flying instructor reported seeing the flash of an explosion about four miles north of Prospect Reservoir, towards Blacktown.</p>
      <p>Police at first thought the Hercules may have crashed but it then contacted Richmond control and, with a Dakota, was diverted to search the area.</p>

        <b>Natural Gas May Cause Mountains Flame</b>
      </p>
      <p>The mystery flame in the lower Blue Mountains area may have been caused by a burning pocket of natural gas.</p>
      <p>But in Sydney last night the managing director of Australian Oil and Gas, Mr T. W. H. Dee, said natural gas was "particularly difficult to ignite of its own accord. " Mr Dee, whose company is drilling at Mulgoa, five miles south of Penrith, said the drilling site was not near the reported scene of the flame. But all country around the Yellow Rock Lookout was in a gas bearing area, he said.</p>
      <p>This follows another report yesterday from a volunteer fireman whose sighting coincided with earlier reports.</p>
      <p>The fireman is Mr J. D. Swales, of Queen Street, St. Marys, who said he had "plucked up courage" to report the "ridiculous phenomenon" after reading the report in yesterday's "Sydney Morning Herald."</p>
      <blockquote>It looked as if someone held up a huge blow-torch into the sky... it was fantastic.<cite>Mr J.D. Swales, witness</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Mr Swales said he saw a flame similar to that reported by Mr White and Mr Jasper.</p>
      <p>"I saw a strange orange flame lifting vertically into the sky somewhere in the western Nepean locality at what appeared to be northern Penrith," he said.</p>
      <p>"That was about 10 days ago and shortly after midday.</p>
      <p>"It was not visible for long, only about a minute.</p>
      <p>"It looked as if someone held up a huge blow-torch into the sky... it was fantastic."</p>
      <p>"The flame I saw was smokeless and straight.</p>
      <p>"I have never seen anything like it before and don't care to see anything like it again, " Mr Swales said.</p>
