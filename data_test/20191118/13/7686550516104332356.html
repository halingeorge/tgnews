      <h1>Gareth Bale reveals the pain fuelling Wales' Euro 2020 dream as Ryan Giggs gives major fitness update ahead of Hungary qualifier</h1>
      <h2>Bale has spoken about experiences that can help Wales</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:34:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:34</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale says the contrast in emotions of Wales' Euro 2016 run and their World Cup 2018 qualifying campaign can help fuel their Euro 2020 dreams.</p>
      <p>As a result of their <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-beat-azerbaijan-what-now-17269235">2-0 triumph over Azerbaijan</a> and Slovakia's defeat to Croatia, Ryan Giggs' men will qualify for next year's tournament if they win at Cardiff City Stadium tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>It comes little more than two years after Wales blew their chances of reaching only a second ever World Cup finals after losing 1-0 to Republic of Ireland in the capital.</p>
      <p>And Real Madrid star Bale admits that campaign - along with his side's efforts at Euro 2016 - can work in Wales' favour when it comes to facing the Hungarians in Cardiff.</p>

      <p>"I think we can use both of them to our advantage," he said.</p>
      <p>"We have got the kind of euphoria of qualifying for our first Euros and doing so well at the competition that we really want to do that again.</p>
      <p>"We’ve also got the negatives of knowing how it feels to miss out on qualifying for a tournament like we did the World Cup so we can use both of them to our advantage.</p>
      <p>"We have the experience of what we have gone through. We don’t want to feeling like we did after the [Republic of] Ireland game, we want to be feeling how we did after the last Andorra game.</p>
      <p>"We will be using all of our experience to try and navigate our way through and we’ll be giving 100% as always to try and win the game."</p>

      <p>Wales will be backed by a bumper crowd at Cardiff City Stadium, with every single ticket in the 33,000-seater venue being snapped up.</p>
      <p>And Bale has called upon the Red Wall to act as the 12th man once again.</p>
      <p>"We want the Welsh fans to do the same as always, to be supporting us, to sing and be the 12th man," he said.</p>
      <p>"We always appreciate their support at every game, they’re always there in their thousands, even on long away trips to Baku.</p>
      <p>"We’ll be trying our best and working hard to keep them happy and to give them as much to cheer about as we can, but the most important thing is we focus on getting the result."</p>
      <p>Giggs has revealed every player in his Wales squad is available to start in the crunch Euro 2020 qualifier with Hungary.</p>
      <p>There were concerns over star duo Bale and Aaron Ramsey, with the former being withdrawn on the hour mark of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-beat-azerbaijan-what-now-17269235">the game in Baku</a> while Juventus star Ramsey did not start on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But Giggs has said the pair are available to start in the winner takes all clash with Hungary.</p>

      <p>"We've got a few players who played 90 minutes for the first time. It is important in these next few days to get the recovery in," said the manager.</p>
      <p>"The lads who got minutes that needed minutes too. As always it's a balancing act. The players you more or less know who won't be able to do 90 minutes and that will impact on the selection.</p>
      <p>"They're both ready to start. Players that needed minutes, Gareth and Aaron were in that scenario. Chris Mepham, Ethan Ampadu, players who haven't had a lot of football, they got the minutes they needed. We were able to get Gareth off and then Aaron as well, we were able to get him on the pitch which was important aswell. Everyone in the squad is available to start."</p>
      <p>Kick-off at Cardiff City Stadium is at 7:45pm on Tuesday.</p>
