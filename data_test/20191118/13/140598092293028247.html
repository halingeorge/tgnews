      <h1>Best charity Christmas gifts 2019 for presents that give back</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:26:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/precious-adesina/" target="_blank">Precious Adesina</a></address>
      <p>While Christmas is a time for giving and sharing with your family and friends, it can also be used as an opportunity to give to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/charities/">charity</a>.</p>
      <p>One way to make Christmas go further is by choosing unusual presents that have a charity attached to it in some way. This could be by gifting someone an item that, when bought, a donation is given to a specific UK or international charity. Another option is to donate to a cause in someone's name.</p>
      <p>We certainly love the idea of using <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/best-christmas-gift-ideas-2019-top-presents-put-ask-this-year/">Christmas gifts</a> to give back to the community. Here, you can find a list of our top charity Christmas gifts, including everything from jewellery to more specific forms of aid.  </p>
      <p>You can also get involved in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2019/11/02/telegraph-charity-appeal-2019-generous-readers-can-help-change/">The Daily Telegraph's Christmas Charity Appeal</a> for 2019.</p>
