      <p>Amazon decided that it couldn't wait for <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday</a> to take $100 off of the Pixel 3a. And decided to do it today. Right now, you can get the Pixel 3a for just $299. The Pixel 3a XL is $399 (that's only $80 off).</p>
      <p>So, why wait for Black Friday when you can get the Pixel 3a at its Black Friday price, today.</p>
      <p>At $299, the Pixel 3a is a really good phone to buy. It was really good at its regular price of $399, but now that it's even $100 cheaper, it's a steal.</p>

      <p>The Pixel 3a comes with the same camera as the Pixel 3, which is still one of the best – really only being one-upped by the Pixel 4. It also is getting a lot of the features that the Pixel 4 has, including Astrophotography.</p>
      <p>Inside, the Pixel 3a is running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 chipset, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There is also a 3000mAh capacity battery inside, which does support fast charge. Google says you can get seven hours of usage, out of a 15-minute fast charge.</p>
      <p>There is also a 5.6-inch full HD+ display on-board, and the best part is that there is no notch. And you still get those stereo front-facing speakers. Definitely a good feature to have on a smartphone in this price range.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Pixel 3a is unlocked and will work on all four US carriers. That includes AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. All you need to do is pop in your SIM card and you'll be good to go. That makes this a really great gift for anyone that is looking for a new smartphone. Seeing as it doesn't matter what carrier they are on right now.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the unlocked Google Pixel 3a from Amazon right now for just $299 <a href="https://geni.us/tIZMM">by clicking here</a>, this Black Friday price may not last long – as it could be a mistake. So you'd better hurry.</p>
