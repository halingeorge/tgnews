        <li>Mariah Carey shared an Instagram photo on Sunday that revealed a meeting she and her twins, Moroccan and Monroe Cannon, had with power couple <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29653321/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-no-chill-instagram/">Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mariahcarey/">In the photo</a>, Moroccan (who goes by Rocky) is wearing a Deadpool mask. Carey explained in the photo's caption that Rocky "snuck up" on the "unsuspecting couple" to get the picture.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29367251/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-dinner-date-selfie/">Reynolds</a> was just as starstruck as Rocky though and described the encounter as a "vision board" moment in a comment on the post.</li>

      <p>If hanging out with Mariah Carey is on your bucket list, then you and <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29637050/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-first-appearance-third-child/">Ryan Reynolds</a> have something in common. This weekend, Reynolds' "vision board" moment, as he described it, came true, thanks to Carey's son.</p>
      <p>Carey shared a photo of herself and her twins, Moroccan and Monroe Cannon, posing with <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29574153/blake-lively-trolls-ryan-reynolds-nose-picking-photo/">Reynolds and his wife, Blake Lively</a>, on Instagram on Sunday, and it's everything.</p>
      <p>In the photo, Moroccan (who goes by Rocky) is wearing a Deadpool mask and striking a tough pose in front of Reynolds, who, of course, stars as the wisecracking antihero in the <i>Deadpool </i>franchise.</p>
      <p>"Rocky snuck up on an unsuspecting couple wearing a Deadpool mask," Carey wrote in the photo's caption. "Will they ever recover? ðŸ˜‰ðŸ’–."</p>

      <p>The feeling of awe was totally mutual, Reynolds revealed in the photo's comments section.</p>
      <p>"Whoa," he wrote. "My vision board became a photo." The good humans at Comments by Celebs captured the note for posterity.</p>

      <p>Excuse me, I have to go make a vision board immediately.</p>
