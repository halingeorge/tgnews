        <b>MORONI, Comoros, Nov 18 – Seven-time champions Egypt were held to their second successive draw of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying as hosts Comoros battled to 0-0 stalemate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The result give advantage to Kenya’s Harambee Stars who can go top of Group G if they beat Togo tonight in Kasarani.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Ghana made it two wins out of two but were made to work hard to edge past Sao Tome e Principe 1-0.</p>
      <p>After their 1-1 draw with Kenya on Thursday in their opening Group G encounter Egypt held on for another point on Monday in Comoros.</p>
      <p>The Pharaohs began well with Mahmoud ‘Kahraba’ Abdel-Moneim firing a shot against the bar after nine minutes.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later they had another good chance after the Comoros keeper was ruled to have picked up a back pass only for the resulting indirect freekick to be blocked and cleared by the hosts’ defence.</p>
      <p>Both sides had their best opportunities to break the deadlock midway through the second haff.</p>
      <p>Firstly Aston Villa’s Trezeguet was put through for a one-on-one with the keeper only to stab his effort wide of the post.</p>
      <p>Minutes later Kassim M’Dahoma jinxed his way into the area and his shot was blocked a little fortuitously by keeper Mohamed El Shenawy’s shoulder as he dived to make the save.</p>
      <p>The game was played in intensely hot conditions with the referee allowing official water breaks in both halves of the match.</p>
      <p>The result means Comoros are now on four points from their two matches, after their win in Togo, while Egypt are on two.</p>
      <p>Ghana scored a second-half penalty to edge past Sao Tome 1-0 and take them top of Group C.</p>
      <p>The Black Stars struggled to break down a resolute Sao Tome defence until just after the break when Emmanuel Boateng was fouled in the area to allow Crystal Palace forward Jordan Ayew to score the winner.</p>
      <p>The result means Ghana have the maximum six points from two games, South Africa and Sudan are on three while Sao Tome are pointless.</p>
      <p>The top two sides in 11 of the 12 groups will all advance to the 2021 finals in Cameroon.</p>
      <p>Cameroon qualify for the finals as hosts but are taking part in the qualifying campaign to gain competitive match practice which means just one team from Group F will progress to the finals.</p>
