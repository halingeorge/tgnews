      <h1>Watch: Deepfake Hollywood Roundtable Gets Weird</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:29:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>The streaming wars are heating up. And who better to weigh in than five of Hollywood’s most notable white men?</p>
      <p>Film site Collider created a <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/virginia-outlaws-deepfake-revenge-porn-1794241/">deepfake</a> roundtable featuring Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Goldblum, George Lucas, and Ewan McGregor.</p>
      <p>And while the video is obviously <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/deepfake-tool-makes-it-easy-to-put-words-into-someones-mouth-1791338/">phony</a>, it’s also pretty entertaining.</p>

      <p>The 15-minute conversation darts from one topic to the next, covering everything from unreturned DVDs, body odor, diaphragms, <i>Friends</i>, and dandruff to the diuretic effect of <i>Star Wars</i>.</p>
      <p>Basically: anything but <a href="https://www.geek.com/geek-pick/cut-the-cord-and-subscribe-to-these-streaming-tv-services-1704574/">streaming</a>.</p>
      <p>Moderator Mark Ellis is the only kosher character in the whole creepy clip. Everyone else is the product of a machine learning technique called deepfake, which replaces an existing image or video with someone else’s likeness.</p>
      <p>The process has recently gained attention for its use in celebrity porn, fake news, and financial fraud.</p>

      <p>Collider Video, meanwhile, employed it for pure entertainment, creating a broadcast that no one asked for, but everyone should see.</p>
      <p>The results aren’t perfect. RDJ’s neck is not that thick, for example. But they are compelling.</p>
      <p>“The world of deepfakes is both new and frightening, as this video demonstrates,” Collider Video <a href="https://collider.com/deepfake-roundtable-george-lucas-tom-cruise-robert-downey-jr">said in a launch announcement</a>.</p>

      <p>The technology, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/18/20970280/deepfake-roundtable-impersonation-collider-tom-cruise-jeff-goldblum-robert-downey-jr">as The Verge pointed out</a>, can’t magic up a whole new character (yet). It can, however, confuse audiences into thinking fiction is fact.</p>
      <p>Check out Collider’s Twitter feed for <a href="https://twitter.com/ColliderVideo/status/1194753176785653761">behind-the-scenes GIFs</a> showcasing how it turned Josh Robert Thompson into Lucas, Evan Ferrante into Cruise, Jamie Costa into McGregor, and Jeff Richards into Downey Jr. (Thompson also expertly portrayed Jeff Goldblum in all his gesticulating glory.)</p>
