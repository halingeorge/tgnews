      <p>Cape Town – <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> midfielder <b>Khama Billiat</b> has taken time out from his busy playing schedule to donate <b>R100 000 </b>in sporting equipment to his former school.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, currently with the Zimbabwean national team, paid a visit to Gwinyiro along with members from his Khama Billiat Foundation, a collaborative effort that was launched last month.</p>
      <p>"I was giving back to the school that l went to. I brought some sanitary pads, soccer kits, netball kits," said Billiat as quoted by the <b>Herald </b><a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/billiat-donates-to-former-school/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>"It took long for me to do it, I don’t know why but I thought, maybe, I would do it with the Khama Billiat Foundation. It’s still new and we started it not so long ago.</p>
      <p>"I found it proper for my team to fly this side and do it here while I am in camp. It is not about soccer only; we just want to try and help as much as we can.</p>
      <p>"And, that includes the disadvantaged people and the disabled people.</p>
      <p>"Everyone needs help, but we should be honest with ourselves that there are some people who need help more than others."</p>
      <p>Billiat will be hoping Zimbabwe can get their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying campaign back on track following their goalless home draw against Botswana.</p>
      <p>The Warriors travel to Zambia to take on the Chipolopolo on Tuesday evening in a Group H clash.</p>
