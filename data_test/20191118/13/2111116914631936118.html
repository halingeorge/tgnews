      <p>If you've been holding off on Alexa-fying your home, this Fire Stick and Echo Dot bundle from Amazon is better than half price in the run-up to Black Friday. At just $41.99, you're saving an amazing 53% on the typical $89.98 price tag and getting both items cheaper than they've ever been on Amazon before. </p>
      <p>For reference, the Echo Dot usually retails for $49.99 by itself, with the Fire Stick coming in at $39.99 on a normal day. But this is no normal day, so grab this early <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> deal before it runs out. </p>
      <p>The Amazon Fire Stick turns any old television into a smart TV, opening your humble old set up to a world of apps and easy streaming for the Netflix generation. You can stream all your favorite entertainment from a range of apps including HBO, Prime Video, YouTube, Disney+, ESPN, Hulu, Apple TV, Showtime and many more. The stick itself simply plugs into a spare HDMI port on your TV, and the remote gives you access to Alexa voice control through a microphone. </p>
      <p>If you pick up this bundle, however, you can forget about using that microphone. The Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation can be used to control your Fire Stick with your voice without having to hold down a button on your remote. The smart speaker can also be paired with a massive range of smart home accessories and act as a main hub for your connected home. Plus, the third generation offers improved speaker quality to keep your tunes sounding fresh. </p>
      <p>This really is an excellent bundle - the cheapest we've seen either the Fire Stick or the Echo Dot go over the last year has been $24.99, so you're getting an amazing price at $41.99 for both. You can also grab each item individually if you've already got one, and while these prices aren't the cheapest we've seen this year - they're still cash saved in the run-up to the holidays. </p>
