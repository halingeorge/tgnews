        <b>The father of Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Haaland has reportedly been spotted at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Norway international has been in sensational form at the start of this season and <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/17/sancho-haaland-manchester-united-transfer-news/">attracted strong interest from the Red Devils</a> and other big clubs in recent times.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/18/lukaku-big-baby-warning-ignored-by-mourinho-for-man-utd-transfer/">Jose Mourinho ignored warning about signing ‘big baby’ for Manchester United</a></h3>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Man Utd can see off competition for Haaland’s signature, but it sounds like there may have been a hint that they’re in a strong position.</p>
      <p>According to David Ornstein on <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1387736/2019/11/18/live-qa-chat-football-with-david-ornstein-mon-18-nov-12pm-gmt-7am-et/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a>, he’s heard from a source inside the club that the 19-year-old’s father was spotted visiting Carrington recently.</p>
      <p>If true, this would be a hugely exciting development for United, who could do with strengthening up front in the upcoming January transfer window.</p>

      <p>Haaland could surely be an upgrade on the inconsistent Marcus Rashford, or at the very least provide Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with more depth in that area of the pitch.</p>
      <p>If his father’s been visiting the club, there really must be something to the recent <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/tags/transfer-rumours/">transfer rumours</a>.</p>
