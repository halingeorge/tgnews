        <b>It has been understood that Premier League giants Chelsea had an opportunity to sign Sergio Aguero in 2010, a year before he joined Manchester City – but Chelsea’s then-captain John Terry opposed the transfer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205858/Transfer-news-LIVE-Chelsea-Barcelona-Man-Utd-spree-Liverpool-exit-Arsenal-Tottenham-gossip"><i>Express</i></a>‘ report, <i>The Athletic </i>claims that the Argentina international could have ended up at Stamford Bridge, as the Blues made a £30million offer for him to Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>But John Terry vetoed the transfer as mentioned earlier, and the move was scuppered.</p>
      <p><i>The Athletic</i> say that Terry was not a fan of the Argentine striker, which is why he passed his opinion on to the Chelsea board to prevent the signing.</p>
      <p>In 2011, he joined Manchester City for €40million – and the rest is history.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has made 353 appearances for the Sky Blues so far, and has scored 244 goals and recorded 71 assists across various competitions.</p>
      <p>He has also won four Premier League titles, one FA Cup, four English League Cups and three English Super Cups, and was crowned the top-scorer of the Premier League during the 2014-15 season.</p>
      <p>During the summer, he was linked with a move away from Pep Guardiola’s side, who reportedly named an asking price of €100million for him amidst interest from Spain and France.</p>
      <p>But he chose to remain with City, and so far, has scored 13 goals and provided two assists in fifteen appearances in the ongoing 2019-20 season.</p>
