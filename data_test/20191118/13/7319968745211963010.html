        <b>A teenage aunt has been hailed as a hero after she came between a machete-welding intruder and her baby nephew during a home invasion. The 13-year-old hero is in critical condition. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, the baby's grandmother, Elizabeth Joyce, said the 11-month-old boy is unharmed "because his auntie is a hero". The children were in their <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/genealogy/county-fermanagh-87161392-237774021">Fermanagh</a> home with their grandmother when a number of men broke into the house. </p>
      <p>She said, "She’s 13 years old and she threw her whole self over that baby and she saved his life.”</p>
      <p>The proud and relieved grandmother told <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/utv/2019-11-17/girl-13-critically-injured-by-machete-wielding-gang-in-co-fermanagh/">ITV</a> news "They burst through the house - one attacker came to me, I was screaming and kicking and fighting back."</p>

      <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said men armed with machetes broke into the house, on Trasna Way, in Lisnaskea, in County Fermanagh, just after 9.15pm on Saturday. </p>
      <p>Joyce continued “The other attacker went for this wee fella, but his auntie - who is in hospital in a critical condition - she threw herself on top of the baby to save the baby’s life.”</p>
      <p>She added: “What kind of a man would go and do that to a 13-year-old girl? Leave her fighting for her life? She’s a hero.</p>
      <p>“The ones who did it should be brought to justice and they should be done for attempted murder because they came to my home to kill.”</p>

      <p>Joyce fought off the attackers and chased them out of the family home. The 13-year-old was left with a stab wound on her back. </p>
      <p>The grandmother said "I thought she was going to die on my chair. </p>
      <p>“They tried to kill us in our own home.”</p>
      <p>The hero teenager is now in a critical but stable condition in the hospital.  Joyce was also treated for a stab wound to her leg and has been discharged.</p>
      <p>Police investigating the attack are treating it as attempted murder. </p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan told the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/machete-victim-a-hero-for-saving-baby-grandmother-says-1.4086451">Irish Times</a> it “must have been a terrifying ordeal for those involved” and that the force was determined to find the men responsible.</p>
      <p>“We have several lines of enquiry which we are progressing at this time but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on."</p>
      <p>Local Social Democratic and Labour Party Councillor, Garbhan McPhillips, said the community is shocked by the brutality of the home invasion. </p>
      <p>He said, "I am angry that something like this could happen. For anybody to break into a house and stab anybody, never mind a 13-year-old girl, is horrific. I don’t what would be going through their heads that they would do something like that. It is unbelievable, to be honest.</p>
      <p>McPhillips added “My thoughts are with the family and please God the girl makes a full recovery. It was an awful ordeal they went through.”</p>
      <p>Alliance Fermanagh representative Matthew Beaumont said those responsible should be caught quickly and face justice.</p>
      <p>“This attack in Lisnaskea, carried out by men carrying machetes, is to be condemned in the strongest possible terms,” he said.</p>
      <p>“This must have been a terrifying experience for [the two victims].”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Anyone with information about what happened is asked to contact police on 101, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</i>
