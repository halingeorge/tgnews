      <h2>Two of Bayern Munich's hierarchy were seen in England as doubts over the futures of Pep Guardiola and Leroy Sane at Man City persist</h2>

      <p>Two of Bayern Munich's top dogs travelled to England last week as speculation over the futures of Pep Guardiola and Leroy Sane mounts.</p>
      <p>The German champions are without a manager and are in the process of reinvigorating their squad.</p>
      <p>Hasan Salihamidžić, their Head of Sports, and chief scout Marco Neppe both headed to England on Wednesday - three days after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> 's loss at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> - but Bayern refused to comment on the motive of their visit when questioned by German journalist Christian Falk.</p>
      <p>Reports linking Guardiola with a return to Bayern have gathered momentum in recent weeks despite the Catalan having another 18 months on his City contract.</p>

      <p>He has won successive Premier League titles but faces a tough task to make that a hat-trick with Liverpool having a commanding lead at the top.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has also cut a frustrated figure since the start of the season with gripes over constant VAR injustices getting the better of him.</p>
      <p>But he retains a property in Bavaria having led Bayern for three years and remains highly thought of by those at the Allianz Arena.</p>

      <p>Another reason for the Bundesliga champions to visit the British Isles is their very public pursuit of Leroy Sane.</p>
      <p>The winger, who is yet to play a game this year after getting injured in the Community Shield, has refused to be drawn on speculation linking him with a return to his homeland.</p>
      <p>Sane was not guaranteed regular football last season such is City's depth of talent and he has been backed to accept the mantle left by Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery.</p>
      <p>The English side though are hoping the 23-year-old, who joined from Schalke three years ago, will extend his stay at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>But were he to leave City they have been linked with Kingsley Coman who joined Bayern while Guardiola was in charge.</p>
      <p>Several variables exist in the deal were it to materialise, but Guardiola's presence at City may be one of them.</p>
      <p>Bayern and City return to action on Saturday with both sides looking to overhaul points deficits to their respective league leaders.</p>
