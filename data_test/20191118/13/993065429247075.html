      <p>Peter Gabriel has paid tribute to photographer Terry O’Neill as a “rebellious, independent and irreverent” man.</p>
      <p>O’Neill, who rose to fame with his work with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, died at home on Saturday at the age of 81 following a long illness.</p>
      <p>Gabriel, best known as lead singer in progressive rock band Genesis, recalled how O’Neill was “not in the least fazed” by his request to be shot smoking a cigarette underwater.</p>

      <p>He shared a long message on his website, writing: “Very sad to learn of the loss of a great photographer, Terry O’Neill, some of whose images helped define the Sixties and whom I was lucky enough to work with.</p>
      <p>“Music, film and fashion photography seems to attract rebellious, independent and irreverent personalities. Terry O’Neill was one of those.</p>
      <p>“When I told him I wanted to be shot smoking a cigarette underwater, he was not in the least phased (sic).</p>
      <p>“He found a place in London – an old Seventies disco with coloured lights and a mini pool in the centre of it, which I’m sure they would fill with scantily dressed young ladies in a very non-PC Hefner way.</p>
      <p>“I jumped into this pool to get filmed, only to discover that the lights had shorted and received quite a shock.</p>
      <p>“He knew how to get the best out of his subjects and his shots and leaves behind some extraordinary work.”</p>

      <p>Gabriel, who played alongside Phil Collins in Genesis’s heyday, was joined by former One Direction star Niall Horan in paying tribute to O’Neill on Monday.</p>
      <p>Horan said: “Terry O’Neill you’ve taken some of my favourite photographs of all time.</p>
      <p>“Because of you I’ve grown to have a massive passion for music photography and I will continue to love your work. May you rest well sir xx”</p>

      <p>Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul said O’Neill’s legacy would live on “forever”.</p>
      <p>He said: “We lost a legend today. Terry O’Neill you made this world more beautiful.</p>
      <p>“My heart hurts today but my god you will love (sic) on forever. Thank you for your genius. Rest In Peace my friend.”</p>
      <p>One Mr O’Neill’s last major public appearances was when he collected his CBE for services to photography from the Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace in October.</p>
      <p>After receiving his honour, O’Neill, who had been suffering from prostate cancer and was in a wheelchair, said the award “surpasses anything I’ve had happen to me in my life”.</p>
      <p>Stars including Sir Michael Caine, Sir Elton John, tennis great Billie Jean King and Barbra Streisand shared tributes following news of O’Neill’s death over the weekend.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Iconic Images, which represents O’Neill’s impressive archive of photographic work, said: “It is with a heavy heart that Iconic Images announces the passing of Terence “Terry” O’Neill, CBE.</p>
      <p>“Terry was a class act, quick witted and filled with charm.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who was lucky enough to know or work with him can attest to his generosity and modesty.</p>
      <p>“As one of the most iconic photographers of the last 60 years, his legendary pictures will forever remain imprinted in our memories as well as in our hearts and minds.”</p>
      <p>O’Neill was one of the world’s most collected photographers with work hanging in national art galleries and private collections worldwide.</p>
      <p>His images have graced album covers, movie posters and magazine covers and by 1965 he was being asked to work with the biggest magazines and newspapers in the world.</p>
