      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:52:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Camilla Tomine and Victoria Ward</a></address>
      <p>The Queen did not give her approval for the Duke of York’s Newsnight interview about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, The Daily Telegraph has learnt.</p>
      <p>Palace insiders last night (Sunday) accused the Duke’s private office of “operating in a silo” as it emerged Her Majesty was only made aware of the prime time interrogation by Emily Maitlis after it had been set up.</p>
      <p>Rather than ending speculation about the Duke’s behaviour, the hour-long programme revived the controversy and generated fresh questions about his movements and various “alibis” he gave.</p>
      <p>Serious questions were being asked at the Palace about why the Duke had been exposed to a no-holds-barred interview without any preconditions attached. It left him having to answer repeated questions about whether he had ever had sex with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an Epstein sex slave, when she was 17, or with other young girls.</p>
      <p>One former senior courtier described the interview as “excruciating” while others said it was a “car crash” but sources close to the Duke said he stood by his decision and claimed he had answered the questions with “honesty and humility”.</p>
      <p>It came as the Prince of Wales was urged to consider downgrading the Duke’s status as a working royal when he becomes king. The Duke also faced questions over a pounds 15,000 loan his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, accepted from Epstein, particularly regarding whether he had a hand in arranging the loan and whether it was made before or after the Duke claims to have cut off contact with the disgraced billionaire.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Evidence emerged yesterday that conflicted with his explanation for why Giuffre’s claims of sex with him were wrong. In particular, his suggestion that a photograph of him with his arm around her waist could have been faked because he never wore casual clothes in London was undermined by pictures of him wearing a near-identical outfit on a night out in the capital.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the NSPCC distanced itself from the Duke, former patron of its Full Stop campaign, after he said his role meant he “knew what to look for” if children were being abused. The charity told The Telegraph: “Prince Andrew was a patron of the NSPCC Full Stop Campaign, which ended in 2009.”</p>
      <p>Royal insiders left little doubt yesterday about the level of anger among Palace staff at the Duke’s decision to grant the BBC interview, and about the advice he was given.</p>
      <p>One royal source said: “The statement Buckingham Palace issued said the Queen was aware of the interview but not that she approved it. It’s extraordinary how this has unfolded, without any real consultation with the Palace press office or even the Queen’s private office. It does seem as if the Duke of York’s private office is operating in a silo, which is really quite dangerous because there is a lack of accountability there. Internally, this is being seen as a f– up.”</p>
      <p>A Palace spokesman would only refer to a previous statement that the Queen was “aware” of the interview.</p>
      <p>“We cannot comment further,” she added. One royal adviser said: “This interview was completely unprecedented in offering a royal up for one hour on one subject without any questions being off limits.</p>
      <p>“Ordinarily you would say to the BBC, ‘He’ll talk about X for 10 minutes but he won’t talk about Y or Z’.” Why didn’t they insist on the Duke being filmed carrying out royal duties and make the Epstein allegations a smaller part of a wider documentary?”</p>

        <figcaption>Virginia Roberts Giuffre speaks to reporters in New York on Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2019, when nearly two dozen women who have accused Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse appeared at a court hearing. Giufre has issued a startlingly clear appeal to Prince Andrew of Britain to “come clean” about his relationship with the disgraced financier. <br/><i>Jefferson Siegel/The New York Times</i></figcaption>

      <p>A source close to the Duke last night told The Telegraph they “deliberately didn’t want to do it like that because it would have looked like a set-up”, but conceded the programme “did not have enough focus on his work”.</p>
      <p>The Duke said in the interview that he had “let the side down” but failed to express any remorse for his friendship with Epstein, saying the “people I met and the opportunities I was given” through Epstein had been “useful”.</p>
      <p>Jason Stein, the Duke’s press secretary, left the Palace by mutual agreement last month after disagreements over the handling of the allegations. Stein made clear to friends the Newsnight interview “was not a good idea”.</p>
      <p>Attention has since turned to the role of the Duke’s private secretary Amanda Thirsk. The Duke is alleged to have told his staff he was “not doing Newsnight” before being persuaded by Thirsk to accept the BBC’s request. For the past six years, the Cambridge University law graduate has been a director of his Pitch@Palace project, which introduces entrepreneurs to potential investors.</p>
      <p>In 2016, she became embroiled in a row over the Duke’s dealing with Timur Kulibayev, the Kazakh oil and gas tycoon, who bought the Duke’s former marital home of Sunninghill Park for five million dollars over the asking price.</p>
      <p>On whether the Duke’s private office had been “operating in a silo”, a royal aide suggested that it was ultimately the Duke’s decision to proceed with the interview.</p>
      <p>The aide denied the Duke had done the interview for fear of further allegations being made against him. Although the Metropolitan Police has ruled out questioning him, a civil case against Epstein’s estate is ongoing in the US, alongside an FBI investigation.</p>
      <p>Asked whether the Duke would be willing to cooperate in any investigation in America, the aide said: “If the FBI reached out and asked him to talk, then he’ll take legal advice and do the right thing.”</p>
