      <p><b>TIRANA —</b> UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin on Sunday made light of his predecessor Michel Platini's return to football next week, saying the Frenchman could take any role except that of a player.<br/><br/>Four years after Platini's ban from all football-related activities for financial wrongdoing, the former UEFA boss is free to work in the sport again on Tuesday.<br/><br/>Ceferin was asked about Platini at Tirana Sunday where he was watching France play Albania in their Euro 2020 qualifier.<br/><br/>"Michel Platini's ban is over. So he can be part in any role in football except as a football player, I think he is a bit old," Ceferin said of the 64-year-old.<br/><br/>Platini is on record this week as tantalizingly saying there would be no rush as elections for top roles at FIFA and UEFA are "some years ahead".<br/><br/>Platini told Swiss television channel RTS in September that he "will be back".<br/><br/>The former France captain was banned in 2015 for receiving a two-million Swiss francs (1.8 million euros, $2 million) payment from ex-FIFA chief Sepp Blatter, who was himself suspended for six years.<br/><br/>"I will be back. I don't know where, I don't know how. I can't stay on the suspension, even if it's a suspension made by idiots," Platini said.<br/><br/>"I was a victim of a form of a plot, yes, totally, between those at FIFA and those at the Swiss public ministry. There was an agreement between FIFA and them to sack me. I'm not going to say it was a plot by the Swiss state," he said. — AFP</p>
