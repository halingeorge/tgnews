      <p>Despite blockchain’s enormous potential, it is far from clear who would “win,” or how they would win, thus making micro-cap blockchain investing quite risky.</p>
      <p>This podcast (<b>5:07</b>) argues against succumbing to “hot” new areas lacking a clear path to profitability, while noting that profitability and conservative investing, issuance and accounting practices have proven reliable signals of long-term outperformance.</p>
