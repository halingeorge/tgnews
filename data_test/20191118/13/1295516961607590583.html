      <p>Vaughn directed the original <i>Kingsmen </i>and its sequel, <i>Kingsmen: The Golden Circle</i>. It is unclear if any of the original cast members will appear in the prequel. However, given the time difference between the two, it is highly unlikely.</p>
      <p>Directed by Matthew Vaughn, <i>The King's Man</i> stars Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton, Rhys Ifans, Matthew Goode, Tom Hollander, Harris Dickinson, Daniel Br√ºhl, Djimon Hounsou and Charles Dance. The film is slated to release September 18, 2020.</p>
