      <p>Ireland’s favourite children’s writer is coming to Mayo.</p>
      <p>Judi Curtin is Ireland’s best-selling children’s author and her books have been sold around the world and translated into many languages.</p>
      <p>She has been called the Jacqueline Wilson of Ireland. Most of her books have modern settings, though she has written a couple of time-slip novels sending characters back into the past.</p>
      <p>Her ‘Alice and Megan’ series has sold over 100,000 copies here alone and are also published in Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Poland, Lithuania and Serbia.</p>
      <p>She is also the author of the smash-hit 'Eva' series: Eva's Journey, Eva's Holiday, Leave it to Eva, and Eva and the Hidden Diary, which have sold 36,000 copies to date.</p>
      <p>She has won numerous awards and has been nominated for the Irish Book Awards on numerous occasions including this year.</p>
      <p>Her latest book, Lily at Lissadell, is set in Lissadell House in 1913. She will speak about this and how she writes and where she gets her ideas at the Rolling Sun Festival in Westport on Saturday next November 23 .</p>
      <p>“Judi Curtin writes sensitive, hugely engaging novels about contemporary girls and the things that matter most to them: friends, family relationships, learning to be happy with who you are,” a review of her work stated.</p>
      <p>All children are welcome – young and old – to meet Judi in The Town Hall Theatre in Westport on Saturday at 2 p.m. The event is free.</p>
