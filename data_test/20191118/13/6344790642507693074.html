      <h1>Cool Video Analyzes The Real World Origins of The Blaster From THE MANDALORIAN</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jeremy Ryan Pierce</a></address>
      <p>A couple of years ago, we <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/guy-demonstartes-how-jet-li-disassembled-that-beretta-so-fast-in-lethal-weapon-4">posted</a> a video created by<b> Ian McCollum</b> on his Forgotten Weapons firearms historical YouTube channel in which he discussed the viability of Jet Li-ing a Beretta as in <i>Lethal Weapon 4</i>.</p>
      <p>One of the most recent videos he posted focuses on the production design of the sidearm/blaster carried by The Mandalorian in the hit Disney+ <i>Star Wars</i> series and the real world gun that it’s based on. It turns out that The Mandalorian’s sidearm is based on the Bergmann No1 / 1894 semiauto pistol, a German gun designed by Louis Schmeisser.</p>

      <p>The video came with the following note:</p>
      <blockquote>The new Star Wars TV series "The Mandalorian" does, in fact, feature a sidearm based on the Bergmann No1 / 1894 semiauto pistol. These are extremely rare today (probably only 5 or 6 still exist), and I am quite sure the prop was built from scratch and is not an actual original gun. However, the prop designers made a great choice, in my opinion. The very first Bergmann automatics were magnificent looking guns, and they fit right into the Star Wars film universe - where from the very beginning the weapons have been basically really military arms with sci-fi bits glued on. I plan to do a video later discussing the prop guns from the original three Star Wars films, but this appearance of something as cool as the Bergmann forced my hand... For the record, no - I had nothing to do with the design or choice of the gun.</blockquote>

      <p>He also posted an entire video outlining the history and mechanical workings of the Bergmann pistols.</p>
