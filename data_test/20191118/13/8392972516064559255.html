      <p>Although Beverley experienced "so many sleepless nights" over her decision to leave the show after three decades, she's sure she's making the right choice.</p>
      <p>With her departure lined up for 2020, the 62-year-old promised her final storyline will see her character go out with "a bang."</p>
      <p>She added: "I've been told Liz is going out with one hell of a bang. I can't wait!"</p>
      <p>This December, Bev will be celebrating 30 years on the ITV soap.</p>
      <p>She'll definitely be missed when she leaves!</p>
