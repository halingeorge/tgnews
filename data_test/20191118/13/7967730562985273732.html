      <h1>Shooters MP with $17m of water assets pushes for mandatory disclosures</h1>

      <p>A Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP who owns more than $17 million of water entitlements in the Murray-Darling basin wants to force politicians to disclose their water interests.</p>
      <p>Murray MP Helen Dalton, an irrigator who owns a farm 40 kilometres from Griffith, is preparing a bill that makes such disclosures mandatory, establishing an online water register that allows the public to look up the water entitlements of individuals, investors, foreign companies, and government departments.</p>
      <p>â€œState MPs are making key decisions that impact on the supply and price of water. If they own water themselves, the public have the right to know about it," she said.</p>

      <p>A critic of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and the Berejiklian government's water policies, Mrs Dalton campaigned heavily on water issues in the lead up to the March election, when she won the south-western NSW seat from the National Party.</p>
      <p>Her own water entitlements in the Murrumbidgee Valley are now worth more than $17.7 million as the price of water has skyrocketed during the worsening drought.</p>
      <p>She has voluntarily declared her water ownership on her pecuniary interest register.</p>
      <p>While all NSW MPs are required to annually update their register to disclose their real estate assets, their sources of income and any shareholdings, they are not required to disclose other assets, such as water licences.</p>
      <p>The bill won't be debated until next year, when it is likely to be scuppered by the government in the Legislative Assembly.</p>
      <p>Asked during question time last week why the government does not force MPs to declare their water ownership, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said if MPs were concerned "they should disclose [their water assets] proactively and put them on their registers."</p>
      <p>Deputy Premier John Barilaro wouldn't be drawn on Mrs Dalton's proposal on Monday, but said "of course, all members of Parliament should declare all interests and assets, including Helen Dalton."</p>
      <p>In her disclosures, Mrs Dalton revealed she owns 1383 megalitres of high security water and 3324 megalitres of general security water in the Murrumbidgee Valley, which is trading at $8000 and $2000 a megalitre respectively.</p>
      <p>She also owns smaller amounts of Murray Valley water.</p>
      <p>Mrs Dalton said the price of water had "gone berserk" but said she was not tempted to sell her entitlements on the water markets, saying "I actually want water prices to go down."</p>
      <p>"I've got no intention of cashing out on my water. The dollar worth on paper for me means nothing. Only that it's pricing people - particularly young people - out of farming," Mrs Dalton said.</p>
      <p>She said her water entitlements were presently being used to farm corn.</p>
      <p>"We're farmers, not speculators," Mrs Dalton said. "If we were, we'd sack all our men, put the equipment in the shed and go overseas and sit on a beach.</p>
      <p>"But I've got employees working on the farm. I don't want to have to tell them, 'sorry we're not going to do anything this year'."</p>
