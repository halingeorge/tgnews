      <h1>Pawnbroker warns probe could spark loan shark rush</h1>

        <b>The head of Britain's biggest pawnbroker has said regulation on cash loans risks pushing some people to loan sharks ahead of Christmas.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It comes after H&amp;T revealed that the City watchdog was reviewing the short term cash loans it offered and could ask it to pay compensation.</p>
      <p>Boss John Nichols said the firm would work with regulators but that its cash-strapped customers would be affected.</p>
      <p>It has stopped offering short term cash loans while the review is carried out.</p>
      <p>Mr Nichols said he hoped these cash loans, which are separate to pawnbroking and typically amounted to about £500, would be available again from January.</p>
      <p>He admitted that the timing was a concern for the business, with pre-Christmas a busy time for giving short-term loans, and had come "a bit out of the blue" from the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>
      <p>"The unintended consequence is that people could go to unregulated lenders," he said.</p>

      <p>Regulation of short-term, high-interest cash loans has had a significant impact on the credit industry in recent years - particularly among big payday lenders, some of which have collapsed. Regulators have introduced stricter rules on ensuring that loans should only be given to those who can afford to repay.</p>
      <p>The company is working with the FCA to review its affordability checks for loans over the last six years, which Mr Nichols suggested had previously been given a clean bill of health.</p>
      <p>They relate to cash loans, sold from H&amp;T stores, which typically required repayment within six to 12 months. Such loans would have relatively high interest, as they were available to people who might struggle to be accepted for a loan from the bank.</p>
      <p>Over the past six years the company said total customer interest payments were £24m. The review will consider whether any compensation should be paid.</p>

      <p>It said: "Should any redress be payable, H&amp;T anticipates being able to fund this from its existing financial resources."</p>
      <p>Although the company said this area of its business only accounted for 4% of revenues, its shares fell by 25% in early trading before recovering later in the morning.</p>
      <h3>Pawnbroking unaffected</h3>
      <p>The pawnbroking arm of the business, one of the biggest in the UK, is unaffected. This will be a relief to some customers who were shifted over from rival Albemarle &amp; Bond (A&amp;B) when the latter collapsed in early September.</p>
      <p>Many were taken by surprise when A&amp;B abruptly ceased trading, blaming "significant" financial losses. Some even feared goods such as jewellery and gold <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49720446">would never be returned</a>.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49886813">H&amp;T agreed to buy £8m worth of loans</a> linked to customers' belongings - known as "pledge books" - from Speedloan Finance, which had traded under the name Albemarle &amp; Bond.</p>
      <p>The deal meant customers of A&amp;B could redeem or extend their existing loans at H&amp;T's 248 UK pawn shops.</p>
