        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> were not planning to make any signings in the January transfer window ‘unless absolutely necessary’ and are unlikely to reinforce at centre-back this winter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gunners are struggling for form and have won just one of their last seven games in all competitions as manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> comes in for fierce criticism from fans and pundits.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard may well want to strengthen his squad in January, but the Athletic’s David Ornstein reports that this was certainly not on the agenda at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>There is some uncertainty over the future of Emery, given results and performances this season, and while plans can always change, a central defender appears not to be an option in January.</p>
      <p>‘It’s probably still a bit early to say and a lot can change before then. I know the plan was not to use January unless absolutely necessary,’ Ornstein wrote in a <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1387736/2019/11/18/live-qa-chat-football-with-david-ornstein-mon-18-nov-12pm-gmt-7am-et/">Q&amp;A for the Athletic.</a></p>

      <p>‘Despite Arsenal’s defensive troubles, I still don’t sense a centre-back will be recruited in January given the numbers they already have and the arrival of Saliba next summer.’</p>
      <p>Reports have suggested that Emery may not even be in charge by January as he has been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/arsenal-board-give-ultimatum-unai-emery-11084985/">given until the end of the year to save his job in north London.</a></p>
      <p>If results do not improve over the rest of November and through the busy month of December then the former Sevilla boss could be fired and a new boss put in charge for the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s next three Premier League fixtures are against Southampton, Norwich and Brighton, with poor results in those games potentially leaving Emery in a very difficult position long before the end of December.</p>
      <p>Emery, for what it is worth, has received the backing of his bosses at the Emirates, with head of football Raul Sanllehi saying: ‘We firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job,” they told Arsenal staff at a meeting.</p>
      <p>‘We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season.</p>
      <p>‘We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect. Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season.</p>

      <p>‘We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will.</p>
      <p>‘We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger.’</p>
