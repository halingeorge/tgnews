      <p>Modders have already started to insert missing pokémon into Sword and Shield, starting with Omastar, but can they reverse Dexit?</p>
      <p>There’s a lot of mixed messages going on with Pokémon Sword and Shield. On the one hand the Dexit controversy has led to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/pokemon-developers-receive-death-threats-fans-respond-thankyougamefreak-11080402/">death threats against developer Game Freak</a> and on the other it’s become the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/pokemon-sword-shield-best-selling-exclusive-year-uk-sales-charts-11174083/">second-fastest selling Pokémon game ever</a>.</p>
      <p>But whatever your views on the game and its reception there’s no getting away from the fact that it’s one of the least content rich entries so far, with more than half the total number of pokémon missing from the game.</p>
      <p>Fans have already started to address that problem though, one pokémon at a time, starting with… Omastar, for some reason.</p>

      <p>The footage you see above is of a modified version of the game created by fan SciresM, who has replaced the corgi-like Yamper with Omastar.</p>
      <p>It’s all very rough and ready, with Omastar just reusing Yamper’s moves and stats, but it is properly animated, since it just reuses the same model form Pokémon: Let’s Go.</p>
      <p>Pokémon: Let’s Go only included Gen I pokémon but the 3D models from Pokémon Sun and Moon are close enough (too close, many would say) that modders should be able to get everything working if they put in the hours.</p>
      <p>That sort of thing never usually happens though and they’ll likely lose interest or get shut down by Nintendo before the pokédex is complete.</p>
