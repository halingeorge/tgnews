      <p>Netflix is in talks to help pay for aspiring screenwriters from Europe to develop their skills on the Isle of Skye.</p>
      <p>The streaming giant is expected to give financial backing to a new talent school based at the idyllic island's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/money/amazon-slashes-price-apple-airpods-20904948">Gaelic</a> college after talks with a leading film and TV producer.</p>
      <p>Chris Young, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/money/amazon-slashes-price-apple-airpods-20904948">Young's Film Foundation</a> based on Skye, said he hoped the link with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/money/amazon-slashes-price-apple-airpods-20904948">Netflix</a> would ensure rising stars from across the continent would be able to travel to the island for mentoring.</p>
      <p>His new talent foundation, which is based at Sabhal M r Ostaig, in Sleat on the island, is looking for "Scottish screenwriters with big ideas" for feature films, TV dramas and comedy series.</p>
      <p>The first participants have already been mentored by actors, writers, directors and producers involved in Killing Eve, Trainspotting, Girl With a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/money/amazon-slashes-price-apple-airpods-20904948">Pearl Earring</a> , The Inbetweeners and Dracula.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Young has now set his sights on bringing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/netflix-crack-down-users-who-20668791">Netflix</a> and other leading film companies, like StudioCanal and Path , on board with the foundation.</p>
      <p>The talent boss has secured support from Film 4, the BBC, the BFI, MG Alba and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for his foundation over the last two years.</p>
      <p>The foundation costs around £100,000 a year to run, with almost a third coming from the new Screen Scotland agency.</p>
      <p>Young said: "I think we've got all the British partners that we can on board to support the foundation.</p>
      <p>"I'm now trying to find a European funding partner so that we have one if not two places for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/netflix-crack-down-users-who-20668791">European writers</a> coming here.</p>
      <p>"There is definitely a need for something like the foundation in Scotland.</p>
      <p>"But we also want to create something people will talk about outside Scotland if we can get sponsorship for places on the programme.</p>
      <p>"I was talking to Netflix about these ambitions last week.</p>
      <p>"They're very keen to get involved.</p>
      <p>"I'm very pro-Europe and the business is very pro-Europe.</p>
      <p>"It would be great to get a couple of writers sponsored to come to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/netflix-crack-down-users-who-20668791">Skye</a> .</p>
      <p>"These writers wouldn't have to have any kind of Scottish connection, but they've obviously have to take part in the residency.</p>
      <p>"Maintaining links with Europe are so important for our industry as we rely on European sales and investment possibilities.</p>
      <p>"With the support that is now in place from the various funders, I think we've arrived at a place with the foundation where it could have quite a long life.</p>
      <p>"It would be good if we could widen its horizons."</p>
      <p>Young has had his own film and TV production company since 1986.</p>
      <p>His previous credits include The Inbetweeners, Venus Peter, Prague, Festival, Gregory's 2 Girls and Seachd: The Inaccessible Pinnacle, the Gaelic feature film.</p>
      <p>He relocated the company from London to Skye, where he has had a home since the 1990s, in 2014, and started production on a new murder-mystery Gaelic drama series, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/netflix-crack-down-users-who-20668791">Bannan</a> .</p>
      <p>Young is aiming to create a Hebridean equivalent of "Nordic Noir" series like The Killing and The Bridge, with filming set to start next year on an eighth series.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>When the Young Films Foundation was launched it was billed as Skye's answer to the Sundance Institute, which Hollywood star Robert Redford set up in Utah in 1981.</p>
      <p>Mr Young said: "We're so lucky to be based at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/netflix-crack-down-users-who-20668791">Sabhal M r Ostaig</a> where, with our unique access to all the studio facilities on campus, we're able to build into the programme an extremely valuable practical aspect to the week's activities.</p>
      <p>"We find that screenwriters gain enormously from first-hand experience in directing, filming and editing scenes from their work."</p>
      <p>Sean Greenhorn, screen officer with Screen Scotland, said: "The Young Films Foundation residency is an incredibly exciting opportunity for Scottish screenwriters working in film and television.</p>
      <p>"Following on from successful editions in 2018 and 2019, it is extremely encouraging that the residency is responding to global trends and focusing on the importance of multi-platform content."</p>
