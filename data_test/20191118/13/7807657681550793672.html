      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Logitech just announced the Adaptive Gaming Kit for gamers with limited mobility.</li>
        <li>It costs $100 and comes with a number of buttons and triggers.</li>
        <li>The game board allows you to place the buttons wherever you want.</li>
        <li>The Adaptive Gaming Kit ships this month.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Today, Logitech announced the Adaptive Gaming Kit that includes a number of buttons and triggers for the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-adaptive-controller-changing-game-spot-wins-clio-award">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>. It's designed so that gamers with mobility issues don't have to spend hundreds of dollars getting buttons for Microsoft's controller.</p>
      <p>According to the press release Windows Central received, the Adaptive Gaming Kit lets "gamers play the way that's most suitable for them by providing a set of controls that are easily configured to a wide variety of use cases. It features a large assortment of buttons and triggers with gaming-grade components for performance and durability, manufactured to the highest standard, at a price point that is far more accessible than what is on the market today."</p>
      <p>Ujesh Desai, the Vice President and General Manager of Logitech Gaming, said the following about the product.</p>
      <blockquote>The Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit is designed to be the perfect companion to the Xbox Adaptive Controller, giving gamers the necessary tools they need at a more affordable price point. It also supports our commitment to inclusivity and diversity in gaming, because fundamentally we believe that life is more fun when you play, and everyone should be able to experience the joys of play.</blockquote>
      <p>You can read about the requirements and contents below. The package contains a lot for the price point. However, keep in mind that you need an Xbox Adaptive Controller for all of this to work.</p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Xbox Adaptive Controller</li>
        <li>Xbox One</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Contents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 small buttons</li>
        <li>3 large buttons</li>
        <li>2 variable triggers</li>
        <li>4 light touch buttons</li>
        <li>Rigid hook and loop game board</li>
        <li>Flexible hook and loop game board</li>
        <li>Button and cable marking labels</li>
        <li>Hook and loop attachment stickers</li>
        <li>Hook and loop ties</li>
        <li>Easy-open packaging</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's great to see that a major company like Logitech is making gaming more accessible. Beforehand, each one of these buttons would cost maybe $30 on its own, but now you can get everything you need — except for joysticks — for $100. It should ship in November 2019 and will be available online and at Microsoft Stores.</p>
