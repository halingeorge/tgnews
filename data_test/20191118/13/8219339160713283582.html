      <p>Nintendo seems to be increasingly seeking to make money from in-app subscriptions in its iOS and Android mobile games, with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/animal-crossing/"><i>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</i></a> the latest example.</p>
      <p>The company previously <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/02/mario-kart-tour-multiplayer/">offered a Gold Pass</a> for <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> …</p>
      <blockquote>Starting in December, Nintendo says it will launch a limited beta test of multiplayer support in the app.<br/><br/>The feature will be limited to Mario Kart Tour Gold Pass subscribers during the beta testing period. The Gold Pass in-app purchase is a $4.99 per month subscription. In addition to multi-player support, Gold Pass includes 200cc racing, Gold Challenges, and Gold Gifts.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>In one plan, you’ll be able to appoint one lucky animal as your camp caretaker and get some extra help around the campsite.<br/><br/>In the other plan, you’ll be able to receive fortune cookies and store your furniture and clothing items in warehouses.</blockquote>
      <p>The news didn’t go down well with other forum members.</p>
      <blockquote>More like empty your pocket camp.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me to delete this off of my phone.<br/><br/>Nintendo’s mobile practices are shameful. Feels uncharacteristically dirty for Nintendo. It’s like mobile Nintendo and Switch Nintendo are two completely separate companies.<br/><br/>Keep this trash millions of miles away from my mainline Animal Crossing. Nothing that even resembles it. Nothing that can be carried over or transferred.<br/><br/>Keep this trash millions of miles away from my mainline Animal Crossing. Nothing that even resembles it. Nothing that can be carried over or transferred.<br/><br/>As someone who’s played this game almost every single day since launch…… nah.<br/><br/>I feel like all these microtransactions and paid services are cheapening the brands of these games.<br/><br/>Pay for a helper so they can help you finish all that nothing you’ve been putting off doing in Pocket Camp.</blockquote>
