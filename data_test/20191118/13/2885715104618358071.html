      <p>Malayalam superstar Mohanlal on Sunday shared a rare photo of himself and director Priyadarshan. The picture seems to have been taken when Mohanlal and Priyadarshan were in their early 20s. The vintage photo captures the strong bond of the actor-director duo. And their friendship seems to have only grown stronger over the years.</p>
      <p>Sharing the photo on his Twitter account, Mohanlal wrote, “A friendship that made countless dreams come true.. then, later and even now. Together, hand-in-hand with @priyadarshandi.”</p>
      <p>The Lucifer star shares a long and successful partnership with Priyadarshan. Both of them have worked together in more than 44 films, which is a record in itself. The duo has given us memorable films, including many in the comedy genre.</p>
      <p>Mohanlal and Priyadarshan recently completed their ambitious project Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham. Boasting of an all-star cast, the film is made on a massive budget. It is said that the upcoming period drama has cost Rs 100 crore for its producers.</p>
