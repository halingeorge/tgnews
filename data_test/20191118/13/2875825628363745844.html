      <h1>Prince Andrew accused of using N-word in Buckingham Palace by ex-Downing Street aide</h1>
      <h2>The Duke of York, 59, is alleged to have made the racist remark in 2012</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:51:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew has been accused by a former aide of using the 'n-word' at a Buckingham Palace meeting.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York, 59, is alleged to have made the racist remark in 2012 to a Downing Street adviser of Sri Lankan descent - however, Palace sources have denied the claim.</p>
      <p>Ex-government aide Rohan Silva today made the allegation - days after Prince Andrew's 'car crash' BBC Newsnight interview.</p>
      <p>Mr Silva said he asked the duke whether the government department responsible for trade “could be doing a better job”.</p>
      <p>He alleged the Queen's second son responded: “Well, If you’ll pardon the expression, that really is the n***** in the woodpile.”</p>
      <p>Palace sources categorically deny Andrew ever used the phrase, insisting he would never use such language, reports the  <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/prince-andrew-caught-in-nword-row-former-downing-street-aide-rohan-silva-accuses-duke-of-york-of-a4289516.html">London Evening Standard.</a></p>

      <p>Mr Silva, 38, told the publication, where he is a columnist: "I walked blinking into the sunshine outside Buckingham Palace, reeling at the prince’s use of language”.</p>
      <p>He claims the meeting was attended only by himself, Andrew and a palace aide.</p>
      <p>He added: “For a long time afterwards I kicked myself for not confronting the prince on his choice of words — and it’s something I still regret today."</p>
      <p>Mr Silva, who was born up in Wakefield to Sri Lankan parents, alleged it was the second time that the prince had used 'unacceptable language' in his presence.</p>
      <p>He claims in 2011 Andrew said: "What you have got to remember is that you’ll never get anywhere by playing the white man."</p>
      <p>Mr Silva added: “I genuinely didn’t know what he meant, and the discussion moved on. But the phrase ‘playing the white man’ stuck in my head, as I’d never heard it before. So when I got back to my desk, I immediately googled it.</p>

      <p>“The definition flashed up on my screen: an old-fashioned saying, used during colonial times, meaning that only white people can be trusted to follow the rules, unlike dark-skinned natives.”</p>
      <p>The N-word is one of the most insulting of racist slurs. It is associated with slavery and oppression of black people in America.</p>
      <p>The “n***** in the woodpile” expression came from the United States and was commonly used in the late 19th and early 20th century.</p>
      <p>It is understood to have described fugitive slaves who hid in piles of logs as they fled north to Canada.</p>
      <p>Tory MP Anne Marie Morris was  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-mp-faces-calls-quit-10769671">suspended</a>  in 2017 for using the phrase during a meeting about Brexit.</p>
      <p>At the time, then-Prime Minister Theresa May said the remark was "completely unacceptable."</p>
