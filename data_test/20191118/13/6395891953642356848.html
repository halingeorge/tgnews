      <p><b>MADRID (AP)</b> - A van carrying 52 migrants and going at high speed smashed through a border barrier between Morocco and Spain to enter the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, officials said Monday.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Interior Ministry´s office in Ceuta said the vehicle broke through a metal gate on the Spanish side of the border around 3 a.m. (0300GMT). It was not clear whether it had broken through other fences on the Moroccan side.</p>
      <p>The official said the 52 migrants were all from sub-Saharan countries. They were only identified as 34 men, 16 women and two minors. Four were treated in a Ceuta hospital for minor injuries suffered in the crossing.</p>
      <p>The driver was a Moroccan citizen and has been detained, said the official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government rules.</p>
      <p>It was not first time that vehicles carrying migrants have crashed through the border but the spokesman said Monday's incident involved the biggest number so far.</p>
      <p>Migrants gathered in Morocco normally try to scale the 6-meter (19.5 foot) wire fences that separate Ceuta from Morocco. Ceuta is one of two Spanish enclaves on the Moroccan coast.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said the migrants would be accommodated in a temporary holding center while their expected asylum petitions are studied.</p>
      <p>Once in Ceuta, the migrants normally apply for asylum or wait for an opportunity to travel to mainland Spain.</p>
