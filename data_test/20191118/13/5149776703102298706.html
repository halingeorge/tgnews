      <h1>Forest old boy reveals his devastation at penalty miss before putting record straight for League One strugglers</h1>
      <h2>Former Forest and Republic of Ireland international Daryl Murphy endured a dramatic final few moments at the University of Bolton Stadium on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:23:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Daryl Murphy admitted missing a last minute penalty in Bolton’s 1-0 win over MK Dons on Saturday left him feeling devastated.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-part-ways-daryl-3277766">Murphy</a>, who left <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> earlier this season, missed the spot-kick with the score at 0-0, though he made amends three minutes later by finishing off Luke Murphy’s cross.</p>
      <p>Now 36, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/former-nottingham-forest-striker-daryl-3330206">Murphy</a> settled the win over their fellow strugglers with a well-taken strike, a goal which saw the Trotters cancel out their 15 point deduction and seal a third straight win.</p>
      <p>“I was devastated to miss it,” Murphy said.</p>

      <p>“It wasn’t the way I wanted it to go. I wanted it low and hard and I have just given enough height for the keeper to make a comfortable save.</p>
      <p>“But you are always thinking ‘three minutes, just give me one more chance’ and I got it.</p>
      <p>“That’s all you want, that’s all it takes. I think I’m experienced enough now to not think that’s the end of the game.</p>
      <p>You miss a penalty in the 90th minute but when there’s three minutes to play anything can happen.</p>
      <p>“Don’t get your head down, keep positive, and then hopefully you get that chance.</p>
      <p>“Luke Murphy did unbelievably and luckily I get across my marker to score.</p>
      <p>“The main feeling was relief… I would have been devastated because of the effort the lads put in.</p>
      <p>“It was up to me to step up and score and I’d back myself all the time for that. It just didn’t happen on that occasion.”</p>
