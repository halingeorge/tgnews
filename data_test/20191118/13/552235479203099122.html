      <p>The 19-year-old took to Facebook in a bid to track his attackers down.</p>
      <p>Cody, from Kirkcaldy, posted a gruesome photo of his ear, covered in blood and stitched back together.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "So I was just jumped in my own car and had the top part of my ear ripped off.</p>
      <p>"Police will be contacted about this."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Cody, who also claims he was punched around 30 times in the head, drove to Victoria Hospital before calling the police.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/teenager-has-ear-sewn-back-together-after-being-attacked-in-fife-town/">Evening Telegraph</a> : "This lad grabbed hold of it and just pulled. He ripped the top of my ear right off.”</p>
      <p>“There was blood pouring everywhere.</p>
      <p>"Doctors gave me 11 stitches to put my ear back together.”</p>
