      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> have reportedly set their sights on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> playmaker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/willian/"><b>Willian</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/napoli/"><b>Napoli</b></a> midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fabian-ruiz/"><b>Fabian Ruiz</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>While the Catalan giants require funds to secure a reunion with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neymar/"><b>Neymar</b></a>, that has not stopped speculation regarding other potential arrivals next summer.</p>
      <p>According to reports in Spain, Willian remains a priority target with the Brazil international's contract expiring at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>However, it is also claimed that the La Liga leaders are keen to sign Ruiz, despite the Spaniard only being in the second of a five-year deal in Naples.</p>
      <p>The Serie A club are allegedly attempting to extend the 23-year-old's contract with the addition of a big release clause, although there are no signs that Ruiz is prepared to accept those terms.</p>
      <p>Whether Napoli retain the services of Ruiz could depend on whether they qualify for next season's Champions League.</p>
