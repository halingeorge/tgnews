      <h1>Snooze cruise: Study sees future for hibernating astronauts</h1>

      <p>BERLIN -- The European Space Agency says putting astronauts into a state of suspended animation could make it easier to reach other planets.</p>
      <p>The agency said Monday that its researchers examined how hibernation would affect the design of a crewed mission to Mars and concluded that it could help to significantly shrink the size of spacecraft.</p>
      <p>While slowing down humans' metabolic rate similarly to the way animals hibernate isn't possible yet, research team head Jennifer Ngo-Anh says the idea "is actually not so crazy." She noted that similar methods are already used to save trauma victims.</p>
      <p>Challenges include designing the spacecraft to operate largely autonomously while the crew -- padded with extra body fat in advance of their trip -- sleep through much of the 180-day cruise to Mars.</p>
