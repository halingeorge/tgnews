      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) on Monday said that it will “suitably increase the prices of its tariffs” from December 1.</p>
      <p>“The acute financial stress in the telecom sector has been acknowledged by all stakeholders and a high-level Committee of Secretaries (CoS) headed by the Cabinet Secretary is looking into providing appropriate relief,” the company said.</p>
      <p>Mobile data charges in India are by far the cheapest in the world even as the demand for mobile data services continue to grow rapidly, the company said.</p>
      <p>Airtel and Vodafone Idea have posted a combined loss of Rs 74,000 crore in Q2 by provisioning for the AGR pending dues. Vodafone has hinted at not being able to remain as a going concern if relief does not come for the sector.</p>
      <p>VIL said it is speedily expanding both its coverage and capacity and is well on track to offer 4G services to 1 billion Indian citizens by March 2020.</p>
