      <h1>Huawei sells out foldable Mate X in China</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:45:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#yanitsaboyadzhieva" target="_blank">Yanitsa Boyadzhieva</a></address>
      <p>Huawei’s Mate X foldable smartphone reportedly sold out minutes after its launch on the Chinese market on 15 November, with the company now planning to release a second batch on 22 November.</p>
      <p>The device, priced at 16,999 yuan (£1,900), was on sale for a short time on Huawei’s online store and buyers were given a 50 per cent discount for screen repairing or replacing, according to a <i>BBC</i> report.</p>
      <p>The Chinese smartphone maker started taking domestic orders for its foldable phone on 23 October, despite initially targeting a mid-year launch. The phone release was delayed due to works aiming to improve the flexible display.</p>
      <p>With the Mate X release, Huawei follows in the steps of rival companies which have already marketed foldable mobile devices.</p>
      <p>Samsung won the race to be the first vendor to launch a foldable smartphone, with its <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/galaxy-fold-finally-hits-shops/">Galaxy Fold hitting stores on 6 September</a>. Earlier this month, Motorola announced adding <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/moto-goes-back-to-the-future-with-razr-reboot/">foldable display technology to its Razr flip phone</a>, which is set to go on sale in the US in December priced $1,500.</p>
