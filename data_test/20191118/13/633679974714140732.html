      <p>The State Security Agency had flagged 300 employees at the South African Post Office, 174 of whom had criminal records.</p>
      <p>That's according to the Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, who was welcoming the three life sentences imposed on former Post Office employee, Luyanda Botha.</p>
      <p>He was jailed last week by the Western Cape High Court for the rape and murder of UCT student, Uyinene Mrwetyana, who hailed from the Eastern Cape.</p>
      <p>Minister Ndabeni Abrahams, says Botha was among those flagged by the security services for having a previous criminal record.</p>
      <p>She says the Post Office will brief her before the end of the month on the outcome of an investigation that she ordered into how Botha remained in its employ in spite of his criminal record.</p>
