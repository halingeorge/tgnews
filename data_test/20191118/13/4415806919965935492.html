      <h1>Alby Mathewson's 15-month Munster stay to end next week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:07:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/steve-neville/" target="_blank">By Steve Neville</a></address>
      <p>Munster have confirmed Alby Mathewson will depart the province next week.</p>
      <p>Following next weekend's Champions Cup clash with Racing 92, the New Zealander's time at Munster will come to an end.</p>
      <p>The scrum-half arrived in Munster in August 2018 to provide injury cover when Conor Murray was sidelined.</p>
      <p>Since, Mathewson has had two extensions to that contract as he enjoyed a productive stint with the province.</p>
      <p>He made 21 appearances last season scoring three tries and has the same number of tries in six appearances this year.</p>
      <p>The province announced the 33-year-old's departure today, saying: "A short-term signing, that turned into a 15-month stay.</p>
      <p>"Getting stuck in from the get-go, and giving everything to the red jersey, we'll be saying farewell to Alby [at Thomond Park] this weekend."</p>
      <p>Commenting on his time at the province, Mathewson said: "Just want to say thank you to the whole Munster Rugby organization for having me.</p>

      <p>"Iâ€™m lucky to have played for such a world-class and historical club.</p>
      <p>"Love my teammates and will miss them a lot. Thanks Limerick for having me.</p>
      <p>"To all the supporters you guys are unreal."</p>
      <p>Munster are well-stocked at scrum-half to cope with Mathewson's departure.</p>
      <p>Conor Murray has returned from the World Cup and he will be backed up by Nick McCarthy, Neil Cronin and Craig Casey.</p>
      <p>Munster will take on Racing next weekend after securing a <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/rugby/munster-do-enough-to-secure-bonus-point-win-at-ospreys-964721.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">bonus-point win over Ospreys</a> last Saturday.</p>
