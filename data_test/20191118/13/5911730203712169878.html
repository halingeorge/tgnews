      <p>PALM COAST, Fla. (AP) — Sheriff’s deputies seized a duffel bag filled with cocaine that washed up on a northeast Florida beach.</p>
      <p>The Florida Times-Union reports an anonymous caller tipped investigators off to the barnacle-covered bag on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Flagler County Sheriff’s officials said in a news release on Sunday that the bag contained 15 kilos of water-logged cocaine bundles. One of the brick-like packages was ripped open exposing a block of cocaine. Thirteen packages were similar in size, while two were slightly smaller.</p>

      <p>Sheriff Rick Staly said it’s likely the bag had been in the Atlantic Ocean for some time and washed up because of rough surf.</p>
      <p>Deputies didn’t find any other bags nearby, but officials notified nearby law enforcement agencies so they could check their beaches for similar bags.</p>
