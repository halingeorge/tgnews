        <b>Buzz is, Pavitra Punia is seething with anger over her ex-boyfriend Paras Chhabra for blatantly lying about her in Bigg Boss 13, claiming that her ex-fiancé Sumit Maheshwari's tattoo on her was his!</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a story that's coming to you EXCLUSIVE on SpotboyE.com and it's a BIGGIE. There have been instances in the past when contestants on Bigg Boss have said things without taking names of the people they're talking about- in episodes and even in the unedited parts put up on Voot. </p>
      <p>Recently, Paras Chhabra ne ek mehfil jamayi and started bragging about one of his ex-girlfriends- Mahira Sharma, Devoleena Bhattacharjee and Rashami Desai were in attendance.  </p>

      <p>Chhabra said that the girl in question had met his parents very coyly in a very traditional style and had even got his tattoo done, adding, 'that she went on to cover that tattoo later with a rose tattoo when they broke up'.</p>

      <p>Now, let us tell you he was talking about his ex, Pavitra Punia. The Yeh Hai Mohabbatein star, Pavitra had covered a tattoo engraved on her with a rose tattoo. But the bizarre thing here is that the tattoo was not of Paras, but her ex-fiancé Sumit Maheshwari's.</p>

      <p>Pavitra was previously engaged to Sumit in October 2015 and the duo was all set to get married. But they parted ways for mysterious reasons. In an interview, Pavitra had confirmed on her relationship with Sumit saying,"Yes, I am engaged to Sumit."</p>

      <p>Paras was dating Pavitra Punia after he broke-up with Akanksha Puri (who made her Bollywood debut with Madhur Bhandarkar's Calendar Girls). However, he later went back to Akanksha. </p>

      <p>We hear, Pavitra is very upset about Paras talking so randomly about her and moreover, saying a blatant lie that she'd covered HIS tattoo.</p>
      <p>We called and texted Pavitra but she remained unavailable for comment.  </p>
