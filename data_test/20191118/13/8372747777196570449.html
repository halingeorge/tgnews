      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- Monday marks five years since the murder of a Southwest Florida man, and still no arrests have been made.</p>
      <p>Al Griffith managed Cape Coral's TJ Maxx store on Del Prado Boulevard for more than a decade before being shot and killed while on break in 2014, just before closing time.</p>
      <p>Police did release a sketch of the suspect, but the man was never identified.</p>
      <p>An anonymous donor raised the reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction to $25,000. That's on top of Crime Stoppers' $3,000 reward.</p>
      <p>If you know anything, call Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS.</p>
