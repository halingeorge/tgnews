      <h1>PS5 Controller Looks a Lot Like DualShock 4 in New Patent</h1>
      <h2>Bigger triggers, smaller thumbsticks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/LiamCroft" target="_blank">Liam Croft</a></address>
      <p>In <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/10/ps5_controller_detailed_looks_a_lot_like_the_ps4s_dualshock_4_with_some_exciting_new_additions">recent Wired articles</a> discussing next year's PlayStation 5, the all-new controller that will ship with the console has been described as looking a lot like the current Dualshock 4 pad. Now, a newly uncovered design on the <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/?uri=/c1800/DE/JP-2019-005960/0A493D7BB9C01BA4712B57A8318A7208A68420EF54F725A2D4AC928C7B752081/30/ja">official Japanese patent website</a> has given us our first look at what the next-generation controller could look like.</p>
      <p>As you can see in the image below, which has been kindly reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-controller-shown-in-patent-images/">Video Games Chronicle</a>, the patent shows a new controller which gets rid of the PlayStation 4's light bar while increasing the size of the triggers, decreases the size of its thumbsticks slightly and features a USB port. As already detailed, the PS5 controller already sounds like a huge improvement on the current-gen pad thanks to haptic feedback for rumble, adaptive triggers, and USB C charging.</p>

      <p>As you can tell, it's a design that looks very similar to what we already have, but then as the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? If the light bar really is gone, however, then we wonder how <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/playstation-vr">PlayStation VR</a> titles will track the perceived DualShock 5 when it comes to playing games via backwards compatibility.

      <p>What do you think of this design? Do you hope the PS5 controller looks like this? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
