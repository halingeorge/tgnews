      <p>THE HAGUE, Nov 18 — Dutch prosecutors said Monday they were investigating racist chants that caused a second division match to be halted.</p>
      <p>The referee briefly suspended Sunday’s game between Excelsior Rotterdam and Den Bosch and Excelsior winger Ahmad Mendes Moreira walked off the pitch.</p>
      <p>Moreira said he heard monkey noises and songs about “Black Pete”, a traditional Dutch Christmas-time character that appears in blackface and attracts accusations of racist stereotyping, Dutch media reported.</p>
      <p>“We are working with police to see what exactly happened... and examine whether it can be established who were involved,” the Dutch federal prosecution service for the Oost-Brabant region said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>It was looking at “visual material” to find the culprits, it added.</p>
      <p>Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the incident was “really terrible”.</p>
      <p>“There is no place for racism in this country. Well done to the referee,” Rutte said.</p>
      <p>The Dutch football association said the incident would be investigated.</p>
      <p>The chants were “downright disgusting,” Jan Bluyssen, competition affairs manager of the association, told NOS Radio.</p>
      <p>“I am just angry and disappointed that this is still happening in 2019,” he added.</p>
      <p>The association said in a statement that “together with the club, we are now looking at how the perpetrators can be traced and dealt with.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘When is it going to stop!!?’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another match involving Den Bosch was suspended in 2013 after repeated racist chants targeted AZ Alkmaar forward Jozy Altidore in a cup match.</p>
      <p>Den Bosch had also faced previous sanctions for racist behaviour by their fans, with 50 of them banned from the stadium for the 2012-13 season.</p>
      <p>Netherlands international Memphis Depay — who was not involved in Sunday’s game — called on Uefa to act after the incident.</p>
      <p>“I’m sick and tired to see these images over and over! When is it going to stop!!?,” Depay wrote on Twitter. “@Uefa what we going to do? Specially with the upcoming @EURO2020.”</p>
      <p>European footballing authorities have been trying to crack down on racist chanting after a series of incidents, including at a Euro 2020 qualifier between England and Bulgaria in October.</p>
      <p>The Dutch incident heightens the annual controversy over “Black Pete”, the country’s traditional Saint Nicholas sidekick. He is portrayed in winter parades and by many Dutch children with a black face, thick red lips, woolly hair and a gold earring.</p>
      <p>Hollywood celebrity Kim Kardashian weighed in on the issue at the weekend. “This Dutch ‘tradition’ called: ‘black pete’ is disturbing!” she tweeted, linking to an article on the subject. — AFP</p>
