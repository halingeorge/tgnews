      <h1>Report: Injured Del Mar runner Princess Dorian euthanized</h1>

      <p>Princess Dorian, the mare co-owned and trained by Andrew Lerner who suffered a fracture to her front left leg in a Nov. 10 race at Del Mar, developed laminitis after undergoing surgery and was euthanized, <b><a href="https://www.drf.com/news/injured-filly-princess-dorian-euthanized-after-developing-laminitis?type=news/all-news">the Daily Racing Form's Jay Privman reported Monday</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The 5-year old mare by Proof was given every chance to survive by Lerner and co-owner Erik Johnson, a defenseman in the NHL for the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
      <p>“The vets said it came out of left field,” Lerner told Privman. “She became very uncomfortable behind. It happened so quickly. It took everyone by surprise, owing to the way she had been doing. We had said all along that we wouldn’t let her suffer.”</p>
      <p>Princess Dorian was competing in an $8,000 claiming race on an afternoon that saw two other horses suffer catastrophic injures. Ghost Street, a 3-year old gelding and Prayer Warrior, a 3-year old colt were both euthanized at the track, while Princess Dorian was taken to the San Luis Rey Equine Hospital to have her leg foreleg surgically stabilized with a rod and screws.</p>
      <p>She was later be able to successfully stand on the limb, but laminitis occurs when the load increases on other legs.</p>
