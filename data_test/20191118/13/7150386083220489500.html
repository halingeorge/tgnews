      <p>India coach <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Ravi-Shastri">Ravi Shastri</a> is surely a troll favourite. Ahead of the historic pink-ball Test at Eden Gardens against <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, seeking blessings, Shastri was spotted at the iconic Mahakaleshwar Temple in Ujjain. He was in the company of bowling coach Bharat Arun. Shastri was dressed in a priests attire while offering prayers. Once the India coach posted the picture on his social media accounts, fans were quick to come up with hilarious responses. Some fans felt that he was there because Sourav Ganguly had become the BCCI president and there were other funny responses as well</p>
      <p>Here is the post from Shastri:</p>
