      <p>A 45-year-old man from Accrington was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine, but has since been released without charge.</p>
      <p>DS Martin Kennedy of East CID, said: "Organised crime, including the supply of drugs, blights our communities and puts ordinary law-abiding people at risk.</p>
      <p>"We remain committed to taking drugs off our streets and pursing those suspected to be involved in illegal activity.</p>
      <p>"I would urge our communities to work with us on identifying those responsible for this type of activity so that we can continue to keep our communities safe.</p>
      <p>"Intelligence from members of the public is key in operations like this and I would appeal to anyone who has information that could assist, to get in touch."</p>
      <p>Anyone who suspects drugs being dealt in their area can contact police on 101.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555111 or online at crimestoppers-uk.org.</p>
