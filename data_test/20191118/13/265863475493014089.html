      <p>Erica Mena has been telling her fans that she is using only natural products since she got pregnant.</p>
      <p>She has been advertising these on her social media account, and while some fans appreciate the fact that she shared these with them, a lot of people told her that she’s only doing this to secure the bag, and she doesn’t even use them herself.</p>
      <p>Anyway, here’s the latest post that triggered a debate in the comments.</p>
      <p>‘Only natural products from @ancientcosmetics for this family Follow @ancientcosmetics,’ Erica captioned her post.</p>

      <p>Another follower praised her and said: ‘You’re so beautiful without makeup and that Glow looks amazing on you. Congratulations on the new addition and your marriage to Safaree ❤️❤️❤️’</p>
      <p>A fan gushed over Erica and said: ‘Beautiful with or without makeup. It’s going to be a beautiful Jamaican princess love by all spoiled by many.’</p>
      <p>Someone else told the mom to be: ‘Erica are these products for all skin types and body types and complexions.’</p>
      <p>One follower said: ‘You look so happy and beautiful! Sooo proud of you and wish you continued blessings!’</p>
      <p>A fan gushed over her and told Erica: ‘How are you this beautiful while pregnant 😘😘😘cause girl I was a 🐽 when I was pregnant with my daughter nose spread and everything I was not this cute lol.’</p>
