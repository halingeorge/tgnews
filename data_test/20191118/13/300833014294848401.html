      <p>When you buy a laptop or PC, the internal storage provided in the system is critical. Most popular brands have gradually increased their storage and finding 1TB storage is quite common. If you have an earlier generation system and you find the storage the only issue, you can invest in a solid-state drive (SSD) of 500GB or 1TB and add to the onboard storage. The part has to be soldered on to the motherboard. An expert will be able to do it for you.</p>
