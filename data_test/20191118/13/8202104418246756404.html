      <h3>Saskatoon city council invested a lot of time and thought into the speed limits for the road connecting to the Chief Mistawasis Bridge, a wildlife rescuer says.</h3>
      <p>Jan Shadick, executive director of Living Sky Wildlife Rehabilitation, said in an interview on Friday that reconsidering the speed limits along McOrmond Drive would undermine the wisdom of council’s original decision.</p>
      <p>Council decided to leave the speed limit on McOrmond at the default speed within Saskatoon city limits of 50 kilometres per hour to try to limit collisions with wildlife that lives in the Northeast Swale.</p>
      <p>That decision appears to have worked; no wildlife collisions have been recorded in the stretch through the swale since the road opened in October 2018, according to Jay Magus, the City of Saskatoon’s director of transportation.</p>
      <p>“The city councillors spent a huge amount of time deliberating on those speed limits,” Shadick said. “The fact that people are not happy about it does not mean it wasn’t the right decision.</p>
      <p>“People piss and moan about 90 (km/h) on Circle Drive. They didn’t change it.”</p>
      <p>City council’s transportation committee voted this month to study speeds along the roadway after hearing from residents who say the speeds deter people from using the bridge. The speed limit on McOrmond goes from 60 km/h down to 50 km/h through the swale, then up to 70 km/h over the bridge.</p>
      <p>A city hall study shows daily bridge usage earlier this year totalled about 9,900 vehicles, far less than the 14,600 to 21,700 that was projected.</p>
      <p>Magus said along the rest of the extension of McOrmond, the most recent data shows there have been 17 vehicle collisions with wildlife recorded, 11 of which involved deer.</p>
      <p>Shadick warned that statistics about collisions may not show the entire picture, since they may not reflect how many animals may have been injured in collisions with vehicles. Some of the injured animals may have died later at another location, she said.</p>
      <p>She also noted that statistics only reflect collisions with larger animals and do not track how many smaller animals such as birds, salamanders and ground squirrels may have been killed. Those carcasses may have been removed by larger predators.</p>
      <p>“I think we need to be careful looking at the data because it is not the full story,” Shadick said.</p>
      <p>Her agency took in 1,160 injured or orphaned animals last year. Shadick said she has witnessed vehicles speeding above the set limits on McOrmond and the bridge. Her experience has convinced her to stop releasing animals in the swale, she added.</p>
      <p>The swale is considered an increasingly rare example of native prairie that is significant because of the diversity of the wildlife living there.</p>
