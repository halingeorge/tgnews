      <p>SEATTLE - Rent prices are shooting up all over the Seattle area, but a new survey has found that the increases are steeper in some neighborhoods - reaching 25 percent or more over the same time last year.</p>
      <p>"With industry giants like Amazon and Microsoft headquartered in this city, it’s no stretch to understand why Seattle is a trendy place to live — and why there’s been an uptick in rent prices," says the <a href="https://www.rent.com/blog/seattle-neighborhoods-rent-prices-increasing/">new survey by Rent.com</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the study's authors, five neighborhoods stood out for their dizzyingly high rent increases:</p>
      <p>1. Greenwood, with a year-over-year rent price increase of 25.57 percent, had the steepest rise in rent costs. The average rent for a one-bedroom in Greenwood is now $2,021.60. The growing neighborhood has a little bit of everything, including the annual historic Greenwood Seafair Parade, making it a growing region of Seattle.</p>
      <p>2. Northgate experienced the second-steepest increase of 24.66 percent, with an average price of $1,818.65 fot a one-bedroom. This district is named after the famous Northgate Mall, which was built in 1950 as one of the nation’s first post-World War II retail complexes, and is now undergoing a complete transformation.</p>
      <p>3. The Central District, with a year-over-year increase of 19.19 percent, had the third-steepest increase. The average rent for a one-bedroom there is now $2,401.09. The Central District is said to be overflowing with culture and history, and a number of iconic musicians and actors who revolutionized pop culture were originally from the Central District, including Quincy Jones, Sir Mix-a-Lot, Bruce Lee and Jimi Hendrix.</p>
      <p>4. Delridge posted a year-over-year average rent increase of 17.95 percent, for a ranking of fourth-highest. Average rent for a one-bedroom here is $1,916.77. The Delridge area is mostly residential with loosely defined zones and a large open space greenbelt. But it used to be known as “Little Pittsburgh” because of its industrial origins.</p>
      <p>5. South Lake Union, which some have dubbed "Amazonia" because of Amazon's headquarters here, posted an average rent increase of 17.15 percent, with the average rent for one-bedroom pf $2,547.47. The district is a hub for active young professionals and bustles with hipster coffee shops, busy bars and delicious food trucks.</p>
