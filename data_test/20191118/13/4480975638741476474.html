      <h1>Stock Market Today: Trump's news on trade, uptrend resistance, eyed for next record</h1>

      <p>US stock markets are set for new records according to futures. The <b>Standard and Poors 500</b> (S&amp;P) may exceed 3,125 points as optimism about trade talks keeps shares bid. </p>
      <p>US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have held a video teleconference with Liu He, China's Vice Premier. Officials from both Washington and Beijing have labeled these talks as "<b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/china-and-us-had-constructive-discussions-about-phase-one-deal-xinhua-201911172141">constructive</a></b>." <b>Optimism</b> also stems from previous comments from Wilbur Ross, America's Commerce Secretary, and Larry Kudlow, a senior adviser.</p>
      <h3>President Trump holds the key</h3>
      <p>Equity investors are awaiting <b>commentary from President Donald Trump</b> on the state of negotiations. Stocks have been hitting new highs amid the president's optimism, who stated that "<b>talks are going along very well</b>" last week. Stock markets may hit new records and surge today if the US and China announce the signing of Phase One of the trade deal.</p>
      <p>Such news is needed for another rally in financial markets, which have already been trending higher as the December 15 deadline approaches. The US is set to <b>slap new tariffs on China</b> on that day, but officials in the world's second-largest economy have requested removal of duties, not new ones. </p>
      <p>Trump has yet to make a decision, but he <b>may reveal his position today</b>, after the high-level talks mentioned earlier. If negotiations break down, shares of all companies may struggle. <b>Presently, optimism prevails</b>. </p>
