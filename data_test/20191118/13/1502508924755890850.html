      <p>Saudi Arabia's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/crude-oil">crude oil </a>exports in September fell by 3% to 6.67 million barrels per day (bpd) from 6.88 million bpd in August, official data showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>Drone and missile attacks on Sept. 14 on two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry - Abqaiq and Khurais - temporarily knocked out more than half the Kingdom's output.</p>
      <p>The United States said Iran sponsored the attacks, a claim which Tehran denied.</p>
      <p>September crude output fell by 660,000 bpd to 9.129 million bpd, figures from the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI) showed.</p>
      <p>Crude stocks fell by 20.27 million bpd to 152.48 million bpd while domestic refinery crude throughput rose by 10,000 bpd to 2.584 million bpd, the data showed.</p>
      <p>Following the attacks the kingdom managed to maintain supplies to customers partly by drawing from its huge oil inventories.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/saudi-arabia">Saudi Arabia </a>and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries provide monthly export figures to the JODI which publishes them on its website.</p>
