      <h3>Phil Spencer Wants More RPGs from Xbox Game Studios in the Future</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 18 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>In an interview with Xbox On, Phil Spencer revealed more about what genre he believes Xbox Game Studios should be focusing on in the future. According to Spencer, the RPG genre is something that has worked well in the past for Xbox, and role-playing games should be an area that its studios should target looking forward.</p>

      <p>Spencer said, "RPGs are stepping up for us" and recalls when Xbox had a number of exclusives in the genre. "When I think Mass Effect 1, which I worked on, Jade Empire, Fable — I remember we had really staked out RPGs as something that was important."</p>
      <p>With the acquisitions of Obsidian and inXile into Xbox Game Studios, it seems that RPGs are still important to Xbox and that a focus on the genre is still there, "it's nice with <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Outer-Worlds/achievements">The Outer Worlds</a> coming out, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Wasteland-3">Wasteland</a> — I think RPG is an area we purposely focused on and wanted to do more."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Outer-Worlds/achievements">The Outer Worlds</a> has been well received by critics and fans alike and has probably proved to Xbox that there is still an audience for the single-player RPG, especially when it comes to <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a>. "As we’re watching Xbox Game Pass grow and grow, we’re seeing more genres enter, and whether it’s genres that used to be popular and coming back or creators trying new things because they have an audience that’s always there and they can think how to deliver stories to those people." Looking forward, Spencer added, "I do think RPG is an area we should focus."</p>
      <p>It's nice to hear this kind of talk from Spencer, though for some it will bring back unfortunate memories from not so long ago, when two major Xbox RPG projects – Fable Legends and Scalebound – were cancelled in quick succession, and Lionhead Studios was shuttered entirely.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Outer-Worlds/achievements">The Outer Worlds</a> launched straight into <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a> and has garnered positive reviews with a current Metascore of 85. Xbox Game Studios' next big RPG release is <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39722/wasteland-3-release-date">next year with Wasteland 3</a> from inXile Entertainment. Wasteland 3 will have players journeying to the frozen wastes of Colorado to rescue the Patriarch of Colorado's lands from his three bloodthirsty children.<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Industry-News">Industry News<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39739/xbox-one-rpg-games#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003474100/3474165.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey<br/></a>Hey everyone! I'm Sean. I have been writing gaming content for various outlets over the past few years while studying a degree in Journalism. I grew up on everything PlayStation — mainly Metal Gear Solid, with a brief foray into the world of Xbox. Nowadays, you'll find me mainly playing multiplayer PC games, but with the recent addition of the Xbox Game Pass for PC, I'm looking forward to improving my TA Score.</p>
