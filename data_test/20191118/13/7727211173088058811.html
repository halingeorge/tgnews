      <p>A man who led police on a 15-minute chase through the streets of Liverpool is suspected of drug driving.</p>
      <p>The motorist failed to stop for patrols <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/west-derby">near to Lower House Lane in West Derby,</a> and continued into Tuebrook and Allerton, at around 11.35pm on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The Ford S-Max then ventured onto the M62 before it was brought to a stop on the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/m62">slipway of Junction 7 of the M62,</a> just over the border into Cheshire.</p>
      <p>The driver was <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/allerton">travelling over the speed limit</a> in residential areas and also on the motorway, police said.</p>
      <p>It is understood <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tuebrook">a stinger was deployed</a> to bring the driver to a halt.</p>
      <p>Officers from Merseyside's Road Policing Unit, the North West Motorway Police Group and Cheshire Police, were involved in the pursuit.</p>
