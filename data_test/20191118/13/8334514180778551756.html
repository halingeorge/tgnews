      <p>BEIRUT (Reuters) - Banks in Lebanon will reopen on Tuesday after a week-long closure, local broadcaster LBCI reported on Monday, following a bank employee union’s revision of new security measures.</p>
      <p>Lebanese banks have been closed since Nov. 12 because of a strike that the bank employees’ federation said was over security concerns by staff facing intimidation from clients demanding their money.</p>
