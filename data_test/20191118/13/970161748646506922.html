      <p>US filmmaker James Gunn has shut down rumours that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/30/mark-hamill-harrison-ford-seen-first-screen-test-original-star-wars-movie-real-trip-10485241/"> legend Mark Hamill</a> will appear in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3.</p>
      <p>After a snap appeared of Gunn and Hamill on social media last May, fans started going wild for the possibility that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/23/mark-hamill-shares-insight-star-wars-ix-rise-skywalker-role-10033089/">Luke Skywalker actor</a> could join the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).</p>
      <p>Alongside the original photo on Instagram, Gunn wrote: ‘Finally stopped by my neighbor @hamillhimself‘s for that cup of coffee we talked about on twitter months ago. And some bbq. And cornbread. And cobbler.</p>
      <p>‘And OKAY IT’S TRUE I ATE THE HAMILL’S OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME BACK OFF. Honestly, though he’s an amazing guy and I am really grateful to him and the whole Hamill clan for a great Sunday.’</p>
      <p>Hamill also posted the picture, gushing that he spoke about EVERYTHING with Gunn.</p>

      <p>And everyone assumed that meant Marvel must have come up in conversation.</p>
      <p>‘Such a great day meeting my neighbor @JamesGunn!’ he wrote.</p>

        <figcaption>Mark got fans excited as he said he spoke about ‘everything’ with James Gunn (Picture: Getty Images <br/>)</figcaption>

      <p>‘We have so much in common &amp; talked about EVERYTHING: the weather, gardening tips, favorite recipes, growing up Catholic, our mutual love of dogs, bleu cheese, risqué limericks &amp; the weather again. #FunWithGunn.’</p>
      <p>But Gunn finally poured cold water over these rumours at the weekend.</p>
      <p>He held an Instagram Stories Q&amp;A with fans on Sunday 17 November, and admitted he and Hamill never discussed him joining the blockbuster comic book franchise.</p>
      <p>‘Mark is my friend,’ he explained. ‘We never had these talks you speak of.’</p>
      <p>It all kicked off basically because of one Twitter conversation.</p>

      <p>Back in February 2018, a Twitter user wrote: ‘@JamesGunn, could you do me a huge favour and find a role for @HamillHimself in Guardians 3? The awesomeness of it might end me, but I’m willing to risk it. Thanks.’</p>
      <p>Then Gunn replied saying the star can ‘come over’ to his house in Malibu to talk about a role.</p>
      <p>He replied: ‘I think @HamillHimself lives around the corner from me in Malibu so he can just come over and we can talk about it over a cup of coffee.’</p>
      <p>And Hamill, whose character died in the eighth instalment of the franchise, joked he was happy to meet with the filmmaker as he is now an ‘unemployed actor’.</p>

      <p>‘I would be happy to do so, both as a good neighbor &amp; an unemployed actor,’ he wrote. ‘All the best, mh … DM me for my contact info if you’re serious. (&amp; a good neighbor) xoxo, mh.’</p>
      <p>So they did kind of get everyone’s hopes up.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gunn has also claimed that the MCU character Adam Warlock is unlikely to feature in the movie, despite Ayesha, played by Elizabeth Debicki, name-dropping him in the post-credits of 2017’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2.</p>
      <p>He confirmed: ‘I never said Adam Warlock was in the movie.’</p>
      <p>Now we just want to hurry up and find out who is going to be in the new GOTG film.</p>
