        <li>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=0c19554d-9dd5-4e31-aabc-f668e6b35090&amp;amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwildalaskancompany.com%2Fstart">Wild Alaskan Company</a> is a wild-caught, sustainable seafood delivery service founded by a member of a third-generation Alaskan fishing family.</li>
        <li>Its mission is to make trustworthy, sustainable fish (salmon, halibut, cod, and more) convenient to access.</li>
        <li>It operates on a monthly membership model, in which you can get 12 pieces of fish for $132/month or 24 pieces of fish for $240/month.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While other kids grew up playing soccer or riding bikes in their backyard, Arron Kallenberg was raised on his family’s commercial fishing boat in Bristol Bay, Alaska, home to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/bristolbay/about-bristol-bay">largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world</a>.</p>
      <p>After spending 15 years working at internet startups, Kallenberg returned to these fishing roots, incorporating his knowledge of technology to create subscription service <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=0c19554d-9dd5-4e31-aabc-f668e6b35090&amp;amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwildalaskancompany.com%2Fstart">Wild Alaskan Company</a>.</p>
      <p>Wild Alaskan Company delivers wild-caught, sustainable seafood from Alaska and the Pacific Northwest to everywhere in the US except Hawaii.</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever visited Alaska or Washington, you probably didn’t leave without trying the state’s abundance of delicious seafood options. And not only is it tasty, but it’s also better for the environment. Alaska even mandates <a href="https://ltgov.alaska.gov/information/alaskas-constitution/">directly in its constitution</a> that fish must be maintained on the sustained yield principle, which prevents the long-term depletion of a natural resource.</p>
      <h3>By signing up for Wild Alaskan Company, you’ll receive sustainable seafood that you can trust. Here’s how it works and what to expect.</h3>
      <p>All year long, the company offers sockeye salmon, coho salmon, Alaskan halibut, and Pacific cod. Depending on availability, it also offers rockfish, wild Alaska pollock, sablefish, and weathervane scallops.</p>
      <p>You can’t get these types a la carte (at least not yet). Instead, they’re bundled together into <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=0c19554d-9dd5-4e31-aabc-f668e6b35090&amp;amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwildalaskancompany.com%2Fpricing">various plans</a>: the Wild Salmon Box (6-ounce portions of salmon), Wild White Fish Box (6-ounce portions of white fish), and Wild Combo Box (6-ounce portions of both types).</p>
      <p>You have the choice between 12 single portions ($10.99 each) or 24 single portions ($9.99 each), to be delivered every month or every two months. These per-portion prices include shipping.</p>

      <p>The fish arrives frozen in a dry ice-packed, insulated cooler, ready to be stashed in your freezer or cooked immediately.</p>
      <p>Wild Alaskan Company sent me its Wild Combo Box to check out. I love eating fish but don’t buy it often when I go grocery shopping because of either lack of availability at my local market, or confusion about the fish’s background and sourcing. Knowing that the service sources from sustainably managed fisheries and was created by people who care about the wellbeing of natural food systems, I could spend more time and energy simply enjoying the fish.</p>

      <p>The fish isn’t “fresh” in the traditional sense that it’s sent to you shortly after being caught. Rather, it’s “fresh-frozen,” which means it’s frozen shortly after it’s caught and handled. Despite the distinction, your fish should still taste great. In my experience, there weren’t any drawbacks in the cooking process or taste.</p>
      <p>The monthly membership design is meant to ensure you’ll always have a flaky piece of salmon or halibut ready to cook for dinner. However, if at any point you want to pause or cancel your membership, you can email the company.</p>
      <h3>The bottom line</h3>
      <p>As we’ve already seen with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vegan-meat-vs-real-meat-companies-future-of-food">online meat boom</a>, there’s a greater urgency to think more consciously and carefully about where your food comes from and its effects on the planet. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=0c19554d-9dd5-4e31-aabc-f668e6b35090&amp;amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwildalaskancompany.com%2Fstart">Wild Alaskan Company</a> is the direct-to-consumer equivalent in the fish and seafood industry, so whether you already love eating seafood or wish you had more guidance picking out the right types, it’s a service you should try.</p>
