      <h1>Queen Elizabeth approved Prince Andrew’s TV interview about Jeffrey Epstein</h1>

      <p>Prince Andrew got Queen Elizabeth’s approval for his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/">TV interview about Jeffrey Epstein</a> — later telling her that it had been a “great success” despite a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/devine-no-honor-in-prince-andrews-self-pity-over-epstein-friendship/">torrent of criticism</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Andrew faced an almost instant backlash for the BBC special, which the Times of London called a “car crash” on its front page Monday. TV morning show host <a href="https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1195818714517704710">Piers Morgan also called it “insane,”</a> writing on Twitter that it was “desperate, toe-curling bullsh*t from Prince Andrew.”</p>
      <p>But the Duke of York was “buoyant” Sunday as he attended church with the Queen, his mother, at the Chapel of All Saints, Windsor Great Park, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10365159/prince-andrew-interview-bbc-epstein-news/#">according to The Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>Once there, mother and son prayed together — and Andrew assured the Queen that his interview had been “a great success,” sources told the paper.</p>
      <p>“He thinks he’s done the right thing and has put the criticism to rest. He was all smiles and was looking very buoyant and happy,” the source said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Emily Maitlis, the BBC journalist who interviewed him, revealed Monday that it had taken a full year to get the prince to agree to the sit-down — and it only happened after the Queen gave the final nod.</p>
      <p>The Duke told her team that “he must ‘seek approval from higher up,'” she <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/emily-maitlis-my-interview-with-prince-andrew-8hhclpwcf">wrote in a piece for the Times of London</a>. “It dawns on us then that he means the Queen herself. At 8 a.m. the next day we have a message telling us to call his office. The Queen, it seems, is on board.”</p>
      <p>She said she was brought into Buckingham Palace for the interview via “the Queen’s own entrance.”</p>
      <p>“I am trying to understand the significance of the Queen giving us her own formal quarters in which to film, but it feels like a code I do not properly understand,” she wrote. “Is she endorsing her son? The need for this interview? Or am I reading way too much into every step, merely because there are so many of them?”</p>

      <p>She called the interview with Andrew “the most extraordinary encounter of my professional life.”</p>
      <p>“A man who has not talked publicly on this subject for a decade has now been permitted to do so and won’t stop,” she recalled.</p>
