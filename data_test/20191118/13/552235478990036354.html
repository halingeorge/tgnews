      <h1>The 5 things on Jack Ross' to do list as new Hibs manager</h1>
      <h2>The new man starts work in the capital on Monday and there's plenty for him to get his teeth in to immediately.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:23:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> era at Hibs begins in earnest on Monday as the new boss gets down to work at their East Mains training centre for the first time.</p>
      <p>The former St Mirren and Sunderland boss was appointed as Paul Heckingbottom’s successor last week, penning a three-and-a-half year deal to take over at Easter Road.</p>
      <p>His predecessor’s short and not so sweet tenure has left the Hibees sitting eighth in the Ladbrokes Premiership table with just two league wins all season.</p>
      <p>There’s still plenty of time left in the campaign for Ross to put his own stamp on Heckingbottom’s squad and get them climbing the table.</p>
      <p>However, there are a few issues he’ll have to address if he’s to get Hibs going in the right direction.</p>
      <p>Making best use of the players he’s inherited will be the immediate priority. Heckingbottom’s summer recruitment has been heavily criticised and chief executive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Leeann Dempster</a> has confirmed that Ross will be able to strengthen in January.</p>
      <p>Until then though, what can he do to ensure his start to life at Hibs is a positive one?</p>
      <h3>Get the fans back onside</h3>

      <p>By virtue of not being Paul Heckingbottom, Ross will have done this in the eyes of some already. Results are usually reason enough for supporters to turn on the boss, but there were other ways in which Heckingbottom failed to endear himself to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> support.</p>
      <p>The 2-2 draw at home to St Johnstone back in August was, in hindsight, almost a point of no return. Removing playmaker Scott Allan (having started him out of position in the first place) with Hibs winning 2-1 prompted a chorus of boos from the home fans.</p>
      <p>Jason Kerr’s equaliser deep in to stoppage time didn’t exactly improve the mood within the stadium, but Heckingbottom’s post-match comments certainly made things worse.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>When asked about the fans’ reaction to the substitution, he replied: “I didn’t know there was a rule against taking him off.”</p>
      <p>He then explained the nervousness that was palpable from the stands contributed to his players dropping deeper and deeper before ultimately surrendering their lead.</p>
      <p>Heckingbottom made a point of praising the backing of the supporters the following week at Motherwell, despite them audibly calling for a change of manager during a 3-0 defeat. The damage had been done the week before, however.</p>
      <p>Ross, with the exception of maybe Sunderland, remains popular with the fans of his previous clubs. He’s intelligent and astute enough to judge the mood and will know what to say, and more importantly, what not to say publicly. Combine that with progress on the pitch, and the Hibs faithful will be fully behind him.</p>
      <h3>Play two up front</h3>

      <p>After three months of one or the other, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/florian-kamberi">Florian Kamberi</a> and Chris Doidge were paired together in attack for Hibs away to St Johnstone last weekend and the result couldn’t have been better.</p>
      <p>The often criticised Doidge scored his first league goal in green and white thanks to the set up work done by Kamberi. He went on to net a hat-trick in a 4-1 win after his strike partner assisted his second as well.</p>
      <p>Kamberi has a tendency to blow hot and cold, but clearly isn’t suited to the lone striker role. Doidge hadn’t exactly set the heather on fire in his stead, but a combination of the two allows the burden of work to be shared, and their contrasting styles appear to compliment each other quite well.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if the display in Perth was simply a one-off, but it’s certainly a partnership that Jack Ross is worth persevering with until January at least.</p>
      <h3>Sort out central midfield</h3>

      <p>The middle of the park has been a major issue for Hibs this season. Too often they’ve looked lightweight, have been overrun and far too easy to play through.</p>
      <p>That stems decision to release both Marvin Bartley and Mark Milligan and not replacing either with a similar type of player.</p>
      <p>Josh Vela was described as a “good all-rounder” by Heckingbottom when he arrived from Bolton, but there’s been little evidence of that in his performances. He didn’t even make the squad for Eddie May’s only game in temporary charge.</p>
      <p>Stevie Mallan has been deployed in a deeper role that doesn’t really suit his game. He now finds himself linking up with yet another former boss, although given he actually played regularly for this one at St Mirren, Ross should be well placed to get more out of the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>However, a more defensive minded and physically robust midfielder is likely to be high on the January shopping list.</p>
      <h3>Pick a first choice goalkeeper</h3>

        <figcaption>Maciej Dabrowski, Chris Maxwell and Ofir Marciano</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Despite starting the season as number one, Ofir Marciano was dropped in favour of Chris Maxwell in September and has been unable to force his way back in since.</p>
      <p>Heckingbottom’s decision to make a change between the sticks wasn’t unjustified, with more mistakes than usual having crept in to Marciano’s game.</p>
      <p>Until a clanger in the Betfred Cup semi-final against Celtic when he dropped the ball on to Scott Brown’s foot, Maxwell hasn’t done all that much wrong.</p>
      <p>The issue appears to be that he doesn’t make the same saves that Marciano has proven he’s capable of.</p>
      <p>The reported imminent return of Adam Bogdan gives Ross an extra option, even if only until January, but being decisive on who his number one choice is will make things easier for everyone.</p>
      <h3>Tighten up</h3>

        <figcaption>Hibs have leaked goals this season</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In fairness to Heckingbottom, Hibs had improved defensively before his departure, but the bar was low in that regard.</p>
      <p>They’ve conceded 23 goals in their 12 league games to date, with only St Johnstone and Ross County worse off on 28.</p>
      <p>The return to fitness of Darren McGregor and David Gray will be a welcome boost to Ross even with Hibs being well covered for numbers at the back. Their experience and know-how could prove vital it not only keeping the back door shut, but seeing out games from a winning position – a particular weakness so far this season.</p>
