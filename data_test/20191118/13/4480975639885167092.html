      <h4>What needs Gold for more upside? </h4>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/what-gold-needs-for-more-upside-latest-uk-election-polls-boost-the-gbp-and-risk-sentiment-to-set-the-tone-this-am-201911180759">low interest rate</a> accommodative central bank policy has been supporting gold as investors seeking alpha have bought into the commodity. Furthermore, on top of this, the safe-haven demand for Gold has driven prices higher as ETF's gold holdings reached record levels and central banks bought record levels of gold this year. Gold is shining. What will keep that shine going? The same thing that has started it.</p>
