      <p>Cape Town - Sorry guys – it seems Miss SA 2018 Tamaryn Green is spoken for.</p>
      <p>In October Tamaryn, from Paarl in the Western Cape, shared an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3kJ4-hnu4x/"><b>Instagram pic</b></a> with her 330 000 followers of herself and a partner attending a wedding. She captioned it: "My person."</p>
      <p>Her followers couldn’t get enough. "What a beautiful couple," one wrote. Another piped up with, "Finally! She shared a pic of her boyfriend."</p>

      <p>The former Miss SA recently spoke to <b>YOU</b> about the man who stole her heart, 26-year-old businessman Zesimdumise Ndwandwe Nxumalo, better known as Ze.</p>
      <p>Ze lives in Gauteng and Tamaryn in Cape Town, where she’s in her final year of medical studies at the University of Cape Town. "We make a lot of time for FaceTime sessions," Tamaryn tells YOU of their long-distance relationship. "We’re blessed because many of the Miss SA-related events took me to Joburg at the beginning of our relationship. And he often travels to Cape Town for work."</p>

      <p>Ze was born in northern Johannesburg and spent most of his life in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, <a href="https://www.fin24.com/Entrepreneurs/Profiles/swimming-through-20180504"><b>City Press newspaper reports</b></a>. After graduating in 2010 from Kearsney College in Botha’s Hill, Durban, he enrolled for a law degree at Wits but later quit his studies to pursue a career in business.</p>
      <p>Ze met Tamaryn in September 2018 at a store opening in Joburg. "We’d both been invited as guests to the event," Tamaryn says.</p>
      <p>Officially, they’ve have been together for nine months, Tamaryn says about her relationship with the successful young businessman. Why does it work? "It’s simple: we’re each other’s best friends," she explained.</p>

      <p>It also helps that Ze is a romantic soul. "He’s very romantic," Tamaryn reveals. "He knows gifts with sentimental value mean more to me than materialistic things."</p>
      <p>In August she shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1trCY3HXbH/?utm_source=ig_embed"><b>pic on Instagram</b></a> of Ze celebrating her 25<sup>th</sup> birthday with her friends and family.</p>
      <p>Tamaryn graduates next month, after which the rookie doctor will be doing her residency and community service.</p>
      <p>And what’s life like now that her whirlwind year as Miss SA is over? "My life looks a lot different," says Tamaryn, who also was first princess in the Miss Universe competition in Thailand last year.</p>
      <p>"I’m spending most of my time working on my degree, whether working at the hospital or studying at home. I’m still very busy but it’s a different kind of busy that doesn’t require me to wear high heels," she laughs.</p>
