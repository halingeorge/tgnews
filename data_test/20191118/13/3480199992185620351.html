      <p>As the stand-off between anti-government protesters and police continues, the Chinese ambassador to the UK has warned the Government against interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.</p>
      <p>Liu Xiaoming has accused the Government and the Foreign Affairs Committee of publishing reports “making irresponsible remarks” on Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Mr Xiaoming added that some UK politicians had planned to present an award to a “chief propagandist of Hong Kong independence” who has “instigated extreme violence”.</p>
      <p>Mr Xiaoming’s comments come as violence escalated overnight in Hong Kong when police ordered protesters to vacate a university they had occupied.</p>
      <p>District elections are due to be held in Hong Kong on Sunday, but there are fears that the violent scenes could disrupt these plans.</p>
      <p>Speaking in London, Mr Xiaoming said: “The British Government and the Foreign Office committee of the House of Commons published China-related reports making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“What is worse, certain British politicians even planned to present (an) award to a chief propagandist of Hong Kong independence and who has instigated extreme violence.”</p>
      <p>A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: “The UK is seriously concerned by the escalation in violence from both the protesters and the authorities around Hong Kong university campuses.</p>

      <p>“It is vital that those who are injured are able to receive appropriate medical treatment, and that safe passage is made available for all those who wish to leave the area.</p>
      <p>“We need to see an end to the violence, and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue ahead of the District Council elections on Sunday.”</p>
      <p>An alleged attack on a Hong Kong government official in London on Friday was condemned as “barbaric” by the country’s leader Carrie Lam, but demonstrators said the incident had been overplayed.</p>
      <p>Footage posted on social media on Thursday night showed Hong Kong justice secretary Teresa Cheng fall to the ground while being pursued by a large group of anti-government protesters in the British capital.</p>

      <p>The Hong Kong government claimed the incident caused Ms Cheng “serious bodily harm” while China said she injured her hand.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong, which was a British colony until 1997, is part of China under the one country, two systems model.</p>
      <p>In practice, this means that Hong Kong citizens have freedoms that people in mainland China do not.</p>
      <p>The protests are partially about a fear that these freedoms are being eroded.</p>
      <p>The protests in Hong Kong started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.</p>
      <p>People feared this would undermine the city’s freedoms, and although the bill was withdrawn, the demonstrations continued and grew into broader anti-government protests.</p>
