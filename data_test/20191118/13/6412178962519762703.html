        <b>Former Manchester City star Yaya Toure has picked out a Manchester United midfielder as the toughest opponent he faced during his long and distinguished career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Toure, who now plays in the Chinese Super League for Qingdao Huanghai, made 316 appearances, scoring 79 goals during his eight-year spell with the Blues, before leaving at the end of his contract in 2018.</p>
      <p>Toure, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/yaya-toure-lets-slip-guardiola-anger-at-england-handling-of-sterling-fracas"><b>who just last week revealed Pep Guardiola’s anger at England’s treatment of the Raheem Sterling saga</b></a>, has now spoken about who he rated as his toughest opponent during his time in the Premier League and, speaking to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yaya-toure-i-went-to-manchester-city-to-make-them-great-people-were-laughing-at-the-start-pq9kggpqn"><i>The Times</i></a>, he answered: “Nemanja Matic was complicated. He’s not quick but he’s so strong, clever. All the rest of the opponents, because I always looked at them carefully before games, I get their weakness.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/nemanja-matic"><b>Matic</b> </a>left Chelsea in 2017 to join Man Utd but <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/solskjaer-clears-experienced-man-utd-star-for-january-exit-as-replacement-is-identified"><b>could be on the move again in January after reportedly being cleared to leave on one condition by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</b></a></p>
      <p>On having regrets at City, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/yaya-toure"><b>Toure</b> </a>added: “I didn’t do enough. I missed winning the Champions League with City. There’s a lot of pressure. The Champions League is all the great teams, they are clever, they have this sharpness.</p>
      <p>“I saw the game against Atalanta, when City drew, and Kyle Walker was keeper. Unbelievable. He made a save. I don’t want to go in goal. Too difficult.</p>
      <p>“I just want people to give me a chance, and they’ll not be disappointed. I will carry on playing, maybe a few years. Premier League, Championship, depends, but being a manager is something I’m looking forward to a lot. I will start my badges.</p>
      <p>“My big brother Leon is going to help me with that. I want to be close to my family.”</p>
