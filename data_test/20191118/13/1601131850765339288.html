      <h1>Check out the white Galaxy Fold you can only buy in China</h1>

      <p>The monthslong delay the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-fold/">Galaxy Fold</a> went through was a beneficial one, as Samsung was <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/10/02/taking-the-galaxy-fold-on-holiday-it-survived-egypt/">able to fix some durability concerns</a> it had overlooked. But Samsung also decided not to launch the Fold in all the color options it had originally revealed. The device <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/02/20/samsung-galaxy-fold-infinity-flex-display-5g/">was announced in Space Silver, Cosmos Black, Martian Green and Astro Blue</a>, but it is only available in the first two of those colors.</p>
      <p>Well, unless you live in China, where there’s also a white version of the Galaxy Fold, which can be seen in a short video that has surfaced online. To be specific, the white version of the Galaxy Fold is exclusive to China Telecom, one of the three state-owned carriers in the country. China Telecom will be the exclusive seller of the 5G variant of the Galaxy Fold and <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-samsung-flip-phone-for-china-may-just-be-a-galaxy-fold/">will be rebranding it as the W20 5G</a>; the LTE version will be sold unlocked in Space Silver and Cosmos Black like the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>Will Samsung bring a white Galaxy Fold to other markets? Probably not, but we’ll keep our fingers crossed that it does and let you know if we hear anything about that happening. For now, you’ll have to make do with seeing the white Fold — er, W20 5G — in the video below.</p>
