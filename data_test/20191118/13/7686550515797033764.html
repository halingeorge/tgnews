      <h1>Young Wolves star switches allegiance to Wales as he joins Man Utd and Liverpool teenagers</h1>
      <h2>Wales have a raft of youngsters who could make the grade at senior level in the near future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:43:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>Paul Bodin has confirmed Wolves youngster Terry Taylor has switched his allegiance from Scotland to Wales.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old played for Wales Under-15s but went on to represent the Scots' Under-17 side on nine occasions before turning out for their Under-18s.</p>
      <p>But Aberdeen-born Taylor - whose mother Morag is from Cardiff - was included in the senior Wales set-up for a training camp prior to their Euro 2020 qualifiers with Croatia and Hungary in June.</p>
      <p>He has since been included in the squad for Wales' UEFA U21 Championship qualifier with Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>And Bodin admits he's delighted that Taylor - who made his first team debut for Wolves against Aston Villa earlier this season - has joined a long list of players who have opted to represent the Red Dragons over a different nation.</p>

      <p>"Terry came into a training camp in May with Ryan Giggs," said Bodin.</p>
      <p>"He did really well and he's progressing well at Wolves. He used to play for Scotland, he's decided to change his allegiance to Wales, which is great for us.</p>
      <p>"We're really pleased with him but the trouble has been is that he's had a lot of injuries from pre-season.</p>
      <p>"He went away to China on their first-team tour, picked up an ankle injury and unfortunately that continued into the season.</p>
      <p>"But in the last couple of weeks he's picked up form, he's played regularly and came on for the first-team in the Carabao Cup at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>"I've not actually worked with him yet but I've seen him train with the first-team squad.</p>
      <p>"I remember him playing against us in the Under-17s at Llanelli a few years ago - he's a big strong powerful player.</p>
      <p>"But he looks a lot more mobile now in his play. He'll be a big asset for us and we're delighted he's changed allegiance."</p>

      <p>Neco Williams has remained with the Under-19s, despite a clamour for him to move up to Bodin's Under-21s squad following <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-wales-euro-2020-17243269">his impressive debut for Liverpool against Arsenal.</a></p>
      <p>The right-back made his first team bow for Jurgen Klopp's side in the Carabao Cup clash with the Gunners last month, with Bodin admitting his efforts may well have surprised many people behind the scenes at Anfield.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-wales-euro-2020-17242642">Dylan Levitt</a> was once again included in the senior set-up for the crunch double header with Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>
      <p>However, Bodin has said the attacker - who recently signed a new long-term contract with Manchester United - could drop down to the Under-21s again in the near future.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, goalkeeper <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/george-ratcliffe-officially-best-young-16387203">George Ratcliffe</a> has impressed since joining Cymru Premier outfit Barry Town United on loan from Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>And he has remained an integral figure in the age grade sides with Wales.</p>
      <p>However, the Under-21s will be without Liverpool ace Ben Woodburn who suffered a foot injury during his loan stint with Oxford United.</p>

      <p>"He was going to drop down into the 21s and get some good games for us," said Bodin.</p>
      <p>"On the eve of that he broke his metatarsal against Accrington Stanley.</p>
      <p>"It's a huge blow for us and a huge blow for him. We wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p>"He's been big part of Oxford's success this season, playing lots of games which is important for his development."</p>
      <p>Kick-off for the Under-21s fixture in Wrexham is at 4pm on Tuesday.</p>
