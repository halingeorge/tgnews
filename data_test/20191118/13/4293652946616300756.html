      <h1>Browns’ Myles Garrett to appeal helmet-swinging suspension Wednesday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>BEREA, Ohio — Browns star defensive end Myles Garrett on Wednesday will have his appeal for his indefinite NFL suspension for striking Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph with a helmet.</p>
      <p>Former NFL player James Thrash will hear the appeal. Thrash and Pro Football Hall of Famer Derrick Brooks are jointly appointed by the league and the Players Association to hear such appeals.</p>
      <p>Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi is having his one-game ban heard Monday.</p>
      <p>Ogunjobi was suspended for shoving Rudolph to the ground, escalating a wild brawl between the AFC North rivals that began with Garrett ripping off the QB’s helmet, wildly swinging it and connecting with the top of his head. Rudolph was not seriously injured.</p>
      <p>Steelers centre Maurkice Pouncey will have his appeal hearing Tuesday. He was suspended three games after he came to Rudolph’s defence and punched and kicked Garrett while the defensive end lay under a pile of players in the end zone.</p>
      <p>Garrett was suspended Friday — less than 12 hours after his violent actions — for at least the last six regular-season games and the playoffs should Cleveland (4-6) get there. It’s longest suspension in league history for a single on-field infraction.</p>
      <p>The 2017 No. 1 overall draft pick and Pro Bowler is not permitted to be with the Browns while serving his suspension. As part of his punishment, he’s also required to meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell’s office before he can be reinstated.</p>
      <p>Garrett doesn’t seem to have a strong case for getting his suspension reduced. The league ruled he used Rudolph’s helmet "as a weapon" and his alarming conduct in a nationally televised game was universally condemned by fans and former players.</p>
      <p>The league is also expected this week to announce fines for players who left the Cleveland and Pittsburgh sidelines during the melee.</p>
      <p>The Browns and Steelers play again in Pittsburgh on Dec. 1.</p>
