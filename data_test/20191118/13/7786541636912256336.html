      <p><b>MADRIDÂ (AP)</b> - Four Spanish men convicted earlier this year of raping a woman in a notorious case are standing trial on charges of sexual abuse in a separate incident.</p>
      <p>The men had a WhatsApp group named "La Manada," or "The Animal Pack," and are currently serving 15-year sentences handed down by the Supreme Court for raping an 18-year-old woman during Pamplona's San Fermin festival in 2016.</p>
      <p>The case earned renown because lower courts convicted them of lesser crimes.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors allege the men sexually abused a 21-year-old woman in Cordoba the same year as the Pamplona case, after driving her home from a night club and when she was unconscious. Prosecutors say the men made a video of the assault.</p>
      <p>The men pleaded not guilty Monday and exercised their right not to testify.</p>
