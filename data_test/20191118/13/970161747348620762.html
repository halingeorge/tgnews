      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! 2019 finally launched last night and unsurprisingly we’re all already talking about one woman: <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>.</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is ITV’s biggest signing by a mile, taking home <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-ant-dec-make-digs-caitlyn-jenners-rumoured-500k-fee-11172629/">a reported £500,000 for her jungle stint</a> – at least according to Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>So, naturally, the 2019 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-2019-start-date-time-line-hosts-11167643/">I’m A Celebrity line-up</a> were just a tad star struck when one of the most talked about women in the world – at one point THE most talked about woman in the world – rode up to the Australian shore with her A-list lifestyle firmly behind her.</p>

      <p>However, Caitlyn is faced with a much greater challenge than any Bushtucker trial: to become an equal camp mate.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In the opening moments of last night’s meet and greet, the I’m A Celebrity cast were divided into two groups with Caitlyn introducing herself to Roman Kemp, Jacqueline Jossa, Adele Roberts and Andrew Maxwell, admitting she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-awkwardness-caitlyn-jenner-admits-doesnt-know-uk-celebs-11172779/">had no idea who any of the celebs standing before her were</a>. During what is an integral moment when forming relationships in camp, Caitlyn may have accidentally put her foot in it already.</p>
      <p>‘Caitlyn’s arrival might have intimidated the rest of the celeb group waiting onshore,’ body language expert Judi James explained to Metro.co.uk. ‘Roman waved both hands in a ritual of greeting and friendship but unfortunately Caitlin maybe didn’t see him and appeared to ignore him and he joked that he’d “been blanked.”’</p>

      <p>Judi went on: ‘Because Caitlyn is the biggest name on the show and part of the Kardashian “royalty” set, the group would easily have wondered if she was going to be a bit of a diva. At that point Caitlyn threw her arms out in an empty embrace gesture that should have been reassuring as she walked towards them, but established group dynamics can be tricky. Even with a very short-term group, and their weak style of clapping and the way they held back suggested they were still in awe of the US star.’</p>
      <p>‘We tend to judge via the Attribution Effect, ie speedy first impressions,’ Judi elaborated. ‘And that can cause the Attribution Bias, meaning we retain that impression despite evidence to the contrary, so Caitlyn’s failure to spot Roman waving could have cost her dear in terms of group acceptance.’</p>

      <p>However, as the camp mates’ first day continued, the stars were thrown right into the deep and end forced get stuck into their first challenge where, actually, Caitlyn more than proved herself as a team player.</p>
      <p>‘We began to see what Caitlyn is really like and already her often self-effacing humour; her un-diva-like keenness to muck in; her sporting strength and her ability to take a supportive, parental role when the others are frightened is getting her picked out as a potential winner of the show,’ Judi added.</p>
      <p>Tonight Caitlyn faces <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-2019-kate-garraway-another-nightmare-bushtucker-trial-caitlyn-jenner-11174977/">the first real Bushtucker trial of the series where she’ll be up against Kate Garraway</a> in Bugged Out. And after almost being blown off a sky scarper last night, the Good Morning Britain presenter suffers another total nightmare.</p>
