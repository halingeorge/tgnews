      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - China’s ambassador to the United Kingdom on Monday dismissed reporting by Western media on the Chinese government’s policies in Xinjiang as “pure fabrication” and “fake news”.</p>
      <p>United Nations experts and activists say at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in the western Xinjiang region in a crackdown that has drawn condemnation from the United States and other countries.</p>
      <p>Beijing denies any mistreatment of the Uighurs or others in Xinjiang and says it is providing vocational training to help stamp out Islamic extremism and separatism and teach new skills.</p>
      <p>Asked in London about a New York Times article based on leaked Chinese government documents the newspaper said revealed details of the clampdown in Xinjiang, the diplomat said: “I can categorically deny there is such a document. It is sheer, pure fabrication.”</p>
