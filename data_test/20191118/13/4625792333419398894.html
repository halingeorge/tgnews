      <p>An overwhelming majority of Americans think President Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival was wrong, according to a new poll.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/70-americans-trumps-actions-tied-ukraine-wrong-poll/story?id=67088534&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a> released Monday found 70% of Americans view Trumpâ€™s conduct regarding Ukraine as wrong.</p>
      <p>Fewer Americans think his actions should warrant removal from office, however. Fifty-one percent of respondents indicated that they believe Trump should be impeached and removed, while another 19% think Trump should not be removed from office.</p>
      <p>The survey also found 25% of Americans think Trump did nothing wrong by asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the former vice president who is running for the White House in 2020.</p>
      <p>The poll comes as public impeachment hearings focused on whether the Trump administration conditioned military aid to Ukraine or state meetings on a Biden investigation enter their second week.</p>
      <p>Only 21% of Americans said they were following the hearings closely. Regardless, 32% said they had already made up their minds about whether Trump should be impeached before a whistleblower report on his conduct became public.</p>
      <p>The poll, conducted Nov. 16-17, surveyed a random national sample of 506 adults. It has a margin of error of 4.8 points.</p>
