      <h1>Unimpressed cat from popular meme lives in Ottawa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:02:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/jonathan-lamont" target="_blank">Jonathan Lamont</a></address>
      <p>This Ottawa cat is now internet-famous after giving a plate of salad an unimpressed look.</p>
      <p>It all started with a picture captured of the cat — named Smudge — at an Ottawa home in June 2018. According to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/smudge-cat-instagram-ottawa-1.5359199"><i>CBC News</i></a>, which tracked down the cat’s owner Miranda Stillabower, Smudge hopped up on a chair at the dinner table one day.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why he was making that face, but it’s the best thing he’s ever done,” Stillabower told <i>CBC News</i>. She explained that Smudge typically eats dinner at her table and he gets upset if he doesn’t have a chair. That night, someone got up from dinner and Smudge took the seat.</p>

      <p>Stillabower thought the picture of Smudge was funny, so she posted it on her Tumblr blog. It sat there for a few months until it eventually caught on. Over time, it gained new life when someone paired it with a screengrab of an angry woman from the <i>Real Housewives </i>reality TV series.</p>
      <p>Stillabower suggests the original photo became popular because Smudge looks so dissatisfied with the salad, while the pairing forms a sort of argumentative setup.</p>

      <p>Since then, Smudge has gained over 1 million followers on Instagram (you can find him at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smudge_lord/?utm_source=ig_embed">smudge_lord</a>).</p>
      <p>As for how Smudge feels about the newfound fame, Stillabower says he’s “just a cat.”</p>
      <p>“He has no idea he’s famous. He goes about his daily life and it’s normal, then you go online and he’s everywhere. That’s when it starts to be crazy.”</p>
      <p>Next time you see Smudge in a meme on social media, just remember that he’s closer to home than you think.</p>
