      <h1>CFTC Positioning Report: USD net longs in multi-month lows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:35:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/pablo-piovano" target="_blank">Pablo Piovano</a></address>
      <p>These are the main highlights of the <b>CFTC Positioning Report</b> for the week ended on November 12<sup>th</sup>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speculators kept scaling back their gross longs in <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/us-dollar-index">USD</a></b>, taking the net longs to the lowest level since mid-July. Rising hopes on the US-China trade deal lifted US yields and collaborated with the increasing selling pressure in the safe havens, in turn morphing into extra upside in the buck.</li>
        <li>By the same tocken, <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdjpy">JPY</a></b> net shorts increased to the highest level since early June, as market participants kept dumping their positions in the safe haven universe.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd"><b>GBP</b></a> net shorts retreated to the lowest level since May 21. Indeed, the sterling extended its up move in tandem with riding speculations that Tories could win the December elections with majority.</li>
        <li>Net shorts in VIX (aka ‘the panic index’) increased to multi-year highs. The index has been losing ground for the last seven straight weeks.</li>
      </ul>
