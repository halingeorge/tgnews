      <h1>'Savage!' - Arsenal fans loved how adidas trolled Tottenham with an eight word tweet</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal Women side beat Spurs in the north London derby</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:50:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal Women beat Tottenham 2-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to win the first ever north London derby at Spurs' new ground.</p>
      <p>Second half goals from Kim Little and Vivianne Miedema were enough for the three points in front of a Women's Super League record crowd of 38,262.</p>
      <p>The Gunners came into the game favourites having been crowned champions last season and previously beating their fierce rivals 10-0 to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals in 2017.</p>
      <p>But the clash on Sunday was a tighter affair with a superb strike from Little and a defensive error from Tottenham the difference between the sides.</p>
      <p>Arsenal head coach Joe Montemurro said he was delighted with the result despite the under par performance for periods of the game.</p>
      <p>Being a fan, being a Gooner, I’m pleased,” said Montemurro. “We had to do it a little bit differently. We were our own worst enemy, turning the ball over a bit in the first half.</p>
      <p>“It was a little bit interesting because we just didn’t get the distances right when we were building up, which was strange.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal supporters had further reason to smile after the win, after noticing a social media post by adidas.</p>
      <p>The German company, who took over as Arsenal's kit manufacturer at the beginning of the season, tweeted a picture of the Gunners' players celebrating during the game.</p>
      <p>The post was captioned: 'New home. Same old. North London is Red.'</p>
