      <h1>WeWork set to axe 4,000 jobs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:07:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/hasan-chowdhury/" target="_blank">Hasan Chowdhury</a></address>
      <p>WeWork is preparing to axe at least 4,000 jobs <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/10/wework-has-circus-still-has-chance-great-business/">as the office-space provider seeks to stem losses</a> after a botched bid to float - with the first redundancies expected later this week.</p>
      <p>The cuts are expected to hit WeWork’s business in 123 cities, and come as the company faces the consequences of a breakneck-growth strategy that has sent it spiralling into the red.</p>
      <p>Up to 2,500 jobs could go at its <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/15/47bn-wework-office-future-overvalued-confidence-trick/">core office rental arm</a>, while a further 1,000 employees may be sacked across other ventures such as a private school the firm owns in Manhattan, <i>The New York Times</i> reported. </p>
      <p>About 1,000 building maintenance workers may also lose their jobs as the company outsources their roles. </p>
      <p>The sweeping cuts would amount to a third of WeWork’s workforce, and will form part of a wider five-year plan to pare-back the firm’s spending. </p>
      <p>The move comes as WeWork faces an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission following the unravelling of its planned listing in September. </p>
      <p>The US regulator is probing the firm to see if it broke the law by attempting to push ahead with a float that was widely criticised by investors.</p>
      <p>It was initially hoped WeWork would be valued at $47bn (£36bn), but this was quickly slashed to less than $10bn amid fears over surging losses. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/04/uk-companies-could-yet-rescue-softbank-empire/">SoftBank, the office space start-up’s biggest backer</a>, piled pressure on the company to shelve its listing amid concerns about the company’s labyrinthine corporate structure and the control exercised by Adam Neumann, WeWork’s chairman and chief executive, who has since been ousted.</p>
      <p>The Japanese technology investor has since offered WeWork a $9bn lifeline to stop it running out of cash. The company was due to receive a $6bn overdraft from a string of banks upon the completion of an initial public offering, but this was abandoned after the float was pulled.</p>
      <p>Last week WeWork told investors that it has lost $1.3bn in the last three months. Earlier in November, the company <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/06/wework-begin-uk-cull-informing-staff-job-cuts/">issued a formal warning over redundancies to staff in the UK</a>, where it employs more than 1,000 people. </p>
      <p>The notice is part of a wider move affecting WeWork’s Europe, Middle East and Africa business, which is headquartered in London. </p>
      <p>According to account filings, WeWork International, the company’s UK subsidiary, saw losses balloon to £75.9m in 2018, up from £7.6m the previous year.</p>
