      <p>Adukrom, Nov. 18, GNA - The Okere District Assembly has performed separate ground breaking ceremonies for work to commence on two significant projects in the area for development.</p>
      <p>The projects are the construction of an ultra-modern Assembly office complex to house the newly created district at Adukrom and an Okere multi-purpose stadium to be located at Abiriw to improve development of sports in the area.</p>
      <p>Mr Dan Kwaku Botwe, Member of Parliament (MP) for Okere and Minister for Regional Re-organization and Development said the construction of the office complex was to enable the assembly to function well in its mandate as well as enhance development of the area.</p>
      <p>He urged the contractor to be diligent in executing the projects to specifications, adding that any variations that may be needed to ensure a value for money would be welcomed “but we will not hesitate to award the contract to a more competent contractor in the event of breaches”</p>
      <p>Mr Botwe announced that the famous Dawu sports stadium would be developed into a FIFA standard pitch to serve as an additional international sports stadium for training for the Black Stars and other international matches.</p>
      <p>He said considering the cool weather pattern in the Akuapem area, sporting activities would be very convenient hence the ambition of government to develop the Dawu stadium and the construction of a multi-purpose one at Abiriw.</p>
      <p>Professor Peter Twumasi, Director-General of National Sports Authority (NSA), said the construction of the stadium at Abiriw was one of 10 additional stadiums that government plans to add to the existing five to improve sports in the country.</p>
      <p>He said the Abiriw stadium would be a FIFA standard pitch that would have facilities for all the sporting disciplines including a boxing arena for holistic development of sports in the area which would enhance economic development for the people.</p>
      <p>Professor Twumasi disclosed that Ghana had been selected to host the 2023 All Africa games and was hopeful that the Okere Stadium would feature as one of the venues for hosting such international games.</p>
      <p>Mr Daniel Kenneth, Okere District Chief Executive (DCE) said all the contracts had been duly awarded and that works would start immediately was scheduled to be completed in six and seven months for the Assembly office complex and the Stadium respectively.</p>
      <p>Nana Kwame Henaku, chief of Akuapem-Abiriw recalled that few years ago, he was hinted of a sports stadium at Okere and was happy that it had come to fruition and thanked the MP for his hard work and contribution towards the development of Okere.’</p>
      <p>He pledged full support of the chiefs and people of Okere to ensure that both projects were completed on scheduled time.</p>
