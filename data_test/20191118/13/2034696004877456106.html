      <p>Joe Rogan has said that he wants to buy the long-lost Wu-Tang Clan album that was reportedly purchased by Martin Shkreli.</p>

      <p>Speaking on the <i>Joe Rogan Experience</i> alongside Donnell Rawlings and RZA, Rogan said he wanted to buy the album from Shkreli who is currently in prison for <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/martin-shkreli-found-guilty-fraud-2121196">defrauding investors in former hedge funds.</a> He also became infamous after hiking the price of lifesaving HIV/AIDS drug Daraprim by more than 5,000 per cent in 2015.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Shkreli and the lost album, Rogan said: “That guy’s gotta be broke…is there a way I can buy that off him?” He went on to say that he would release the album to fans.</p>
      <p>“I would release that online…Or release it with you [RZA]. But that, sitting there, makes no sense to me. That box looks dope. When you get out Martin, holla at your boy.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, it was alleged that Shkreli was back running his old pharmaceutical company from prison with a contraband phone, according to a report.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/martin-shkreli-steers-his-company-from-prisonwith-contraband-cellphone-11551973574"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a> claimed that Shkreli’s new business behind bars was called Phoenixus, which he hopes will make him “richer” upon leaving prison in 2023 than when he entered.</p>
      <p>Shkreli, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/martin-shkreli-cries-sentenced-7-years-prison-2259022">who is serving a seven-year sentence,</a> reportedly used the phone to read about developments in pharmaceutical research. He apparently also uses it to communicate with company employees including, as per the <i>WSJ</i> report, firing an executive while in jail.</p>
      <p>Despite his conviction, for which he was sentenced in March 2018, Shkreli remains a company shareholder at Phoenixus. He is also reportedly under investigation with the FBI for continuing to be involved with the company.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Wu-Tang Clan teamed up with Public Enemy and De La Soul on a joint tour. <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/gods-of-rap-uk-tour-london-wembley-arena-review-wu-tang-clan-public-enemy-de-la-soul-dj-premier">Reviewing the gig, NME said</a>: “Continuing to celebrate the recent 25th anniversary of their seminal ‘Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)’ album, most of the collective – including Young Dirty Bastard, the son of the late Ol’ Dirty Bastard – are present and correct tonight.</p>
      <p>“…The chance to see the likes of RZA, GZA and Ghostface Killah on stage is always a privilege, and bearing witness to the Wu rattling through the essential likes of ‘Bring da Ruckus’, ‘Clan in da Front’ and ‘Da Mystery of Chessboxin’ never fails to disappoint. Along with a healthy supply of ’36 Chambers’ material, their 30-song setlist is strewn with Wu-related classics…a frenetic late burst of energy from Young Dirty Bastard as he dives into the crowd during a frantic rendition of his father’s ‘Shimmy Shimmy Ya’ and ‘Got Your Money’.</p>
      <p>“The others look on, all grinning – maybe a full Sons of Wu-Tang band might be a good idea in the future after all?”</p>
