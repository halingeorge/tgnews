      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S9 and Note 9 will get Android 10 beta update ‘soon’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:08:12+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/damien9to5/" target="_blank">Damien Wilde</a></address>
      <p>The Android 10 beta is in full swing for the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 but is set to be extended to the Galaxy S9 and Note 9 at some point in the not-too-distant future.</p>
      <p>For those that have either of the 2018 flagships, this is exceptional news and really cements Samsung’s progress with support for older devices rather than simply pushing them aside without a second thought.</p>
      <p>It was confirmed that we’re likely to see the updates over the coming weeks after a Samsung Beta Operations Manager responded to a <a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8-9-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80-%EC%9D%B4%EB%B2%88%EC%A3%BC-%EC%A4%91-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91-%EB%90%A0-%EC%98%88%EC%A0%95/td-p/2750398">post over on the South Korean Samsung Community pages</a> (via <i><a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-note-9-galaxy-s9-android-10-beta-coming-soon">SamMobile</a></i>) stating that the Android 10 update is likely to come to the Galaxy S9 and Note 9 within the next week.</p>
      <p>This really is fantastic news for those hoping to get Android 10 in the coming months, as getting test builds out is a sign that we’ll see stable builds potentially before the year is out. That said, as this is only confirmation of a Korean Android 10 beta, it may take a little longer for localizations and carrier builds to be offered globally.</p>
      <p>All of the brand new controls and features as part of Android 10 should really help freshen up the Galaxy S9 and Note 9 — which despite being over 12 months old at this point really are fantastic smartphones. One UI 2.0 takes many of the base Android 10 features and adds a touch of Samsung ‘sheen’ to give you the trademark experience we’ve come to expect from the South Korean tech giant.</p>
      <p>Of course, should we know any further details on the rollout, we’ll be the first to let you know when you can register to be part of the beta.</p>
