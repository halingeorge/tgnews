          <b>A WOMAN has revealed how she flew 500 miles to lose her virginity on her first date with her Sugar Daddy.</b>

      </p>
      <p>Gabrielle Reese was just 18 when she travelled for her first ever sexual experience in January 2017, with Jacob Boswell, who's 24 years her senior, <i>and</i> his girlfriend.</p>

      <p>Now 21, Gabrielle, who's originally from Idaho, is in a happy throuple with both Jacob, 45, and Megan Muirhead, 29, in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
      <p>Graphic designer Gabrielle, who's bisexual and likes older men, spoke to the couple online for three months before flying to meet them in person.</p>
      <p>She said: “I did lose my virginity that first weekend. The whole thing was exciting and new.</p>
      <p>“We all clicked very fast and there was a lot of chemistry – we were all involved that first night.</p>

      <p>“There were definitely positives. Jacob and Megan are both older, while I had no experience.</p>
      <p>“Losing my virginity to a guy and a girl, being bisexual, I got to experience all aspects of my sexuality, too. Girls are soft, delicate and nurturing, while men are more dominant.</p>
      <p>“I’d never thought that much about how I would lose my virginity, but I guess it wasn’t what I predicted. I don’t have any regrets though – we’re still here three years later.”</p>

      <p>Gabrielle had no prior sexual experience as she always liked older guys, which stopped her getting into a romantic relationship with someone her own age.</p>
      <p>When she turned 18, Gabrielle joined a sugar dating website and matched with software developer Jacob in October 2016.</p>
      <p>She flew out to meet him and Megan, who's been with Jacob for 11 years, a few days before her 19th birthday.</p>
      <p>But Gabrielle faced reluctance from her mum Kathea, 44, who's younger than Jacob, and dad Don, 46.</p>

      <p>“My family knew but they weren’t too happy,” she said. “But I was very, very honest.</p>
      <p>“Growing up, I’d warned my parents I wanted to marry someone their age, but I think they thought I was joking.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always known I liked older guys – and girls too – so when I saw on Jacob’s website profile that he had a girlfriend, too, he checked all the boxes.</p>
      <p>“But I told my parents I was flying from Idaho to Utah for a first date with a couple I’d only Facetimed once before, so I do understand why they were concerned.”</p>

      <p>When she arrived in Utah after her hour-long flight, Gabrielle spent the first day with Jacob, moving on to become a “throuple” that night and the following day.</p>
      <p>“Megan had work, so Jacob and I went to their house and hung out, watching TV and got dinner,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It was all very normal and that’s what we did when Megan finished work too.</p>
      <p>“After spending our first night together Megan told me she loved me and she wanted me to move in – I was like, ‘Who knows?’</p>
      <p>“That first night I lost my virginity and yeah.. I was nervous about the whole experience – but in a good way. The nerves were definitely worth it.</p>
      <p>“I knew that I wanted to do it. I don’t think I could have had a better experience for my first time – it was so intimate and perfect.”</p>

      <p>After her two-night trip, Gabrielle returned home but was texting the couple constantly and became increasingly keen to move in with them.</p>
      <p>“I asked if they had been serious and they said they were 100 per cent up for me moving in,” she continued. “A month later that’s just what I did.</p>
      <p>“I’d never been in a relationship before, let alone moved states for two people – one of whom was in his 40s and the other a girl!</p>
      <p>“This was my first ever relationship, I was moving in after meeting them once, and being invited straight into a shared bedroom – it was a huge adjustment.</p>
      <p>“It did feel weird at times, but I think anyone’s first relationship does, and at the same time, somehow it just worked.”</p>
      <blockquote>This was my first ever relationship, I was moving in after meeting them once, and being invited straight into a shared bedroom was a huge adjustment<cite>Gabrielle Reese21</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Although the throuple are open about their relationship, which is monogamous to each other, they can feel judged by outsiders.</p>
      <p>Gabrielle said: “I’ve never had anyone say anything negative to my face, but you can see it in their faces as soon as they find out.</p>
      <p>“People tend to sexualise it and ask a lot of invasive questions that they would not ask anyone else.</p>
      <p>“With any relationship there’s problems and the only difference is we have one extra person.</p>
      <p>“An extra person requires extra passion, extra patience and extra compassion – of course we have ups and downs.</p>

      <p>“There’s definitely been jealously throughout the relationship – it ebbs and flows. It’s not a feeling I want to have, so it’s something we work on as a triad.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard not to get those feelings when the other two are going on a date and you’re not invited, but you learn to accept it and let it flow.</p>
      <p>“But we have a healthy sex life together. One month we have sex five times a week, another month it will be once a week.</p>
      <p>“I’m totally happy being with Jacob and Megan sexually for the rest of my life – I don’t care about anyone else.”</p>
      <p>Gabrielle is now looking to the future, including her plans to raise kids as a throuple.</p>
      <p>She said: “I know for sure I want to have children down the line. I don’t know where that is in our future but I think we would all love that.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, there’s no legal way for us to all marry but a ceremony would be nice at some point.”</p>
      <blockquote>There’s definitely been jealously throughout the relationship<cite>Gabrielle Reese21</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Despite loving their unconventional relationship, Gabrielle moved out of Jacob and Megan's home and into her own flat nearby a few months ago.</p>
      <p>“I needed a bit of independence,” she said. “I was so young when I moved out here that I hadn’t really seen very much of life.</p>
      <p>“But we’re coming up for three years as a triad now and we’re completely solid.</p>
      <p>“My family know how happy I am now and they’ve come to accept our relationship.</p>
      <p>“I think they’re just happy I didn’t get kidnapped or locked in a basement after that first weekend.”</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Jacob says he gets more critics about the age gap than having two girlfriends.</p>
      <p>He said: “I definitely get more of a reaction from people about the age gap than being poly.</p>
      <p>“When people hear I have two girlfriends they always go, ‘Well done,’ but when they hear about the age gap they imply it’s not OK, as if I am cradle snatching.</p>
      <p>“It’s not been as direct as saying ‘you’re a monster.’</p>
      <p>“It’s more subtle, like, why would someone my age want to date someone Gabrielle’s age. It’s simple – she’s hot!”</p>
