      <p>Prince Andrew has been accused of using the N-word in a conversation with a senior political aide, adding to the royal’s woes after his BBC Newsnight interview regarding his friendship with the sex offender <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jeffrey+Epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>The claim was made <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Rohan+Silva">Rohan Silva</a>, a former aide to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=David+Cameron">David Cameron</a>, who met the prince at Buckingham Palace in 2012.</p>
      <p>Mr Silva asked Queen Elizabeth’s son whether the government department responsible for trade “could be doing a better job”, according to the Evening Standard.</p>
      <p>He claims the prince responded: “Well, if you’ll pardon the expression, that really is the n***** in the woodpile.”</p>
      <p>The same phrase was used by Conservative MP <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Anne+Marie+Morris">Anne Marie Morris</a> in 2017, prompting the party to suspend for her for several months.</p>
      <p>The Evening Standard quoted unnamed palace sources insisting Andrew never made the comment and would never use such language.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Silva, who is from a Sri Lankan background, says he “walked blinking into the sunshine outside Buckingham Palace, reeling at the prince’s use of language” following the meeting.</p>
      <p>“For a long time afterwards I kicked myself for not confronting the prince on his choice of words – and it’s something I still regret today. He clearly wasn’t taken to task very often by the people around him, which meant offensive language could go unchallenged.”</p>
      <p>Mr Silva said the private meeting was attended by him, the prince, and a royal aide, making it harder to independently verify the claim.</p>
      <p>The phrase originated in early 19th century US, relating to slaves attempting to hide in piles of wood while fleeing, later becoming a phrase used to mean an “unknown factor affecting a situation in an adverse way”.</p>
      <p>The Atlantic has previously quoted a linguistics professor saying the “the phrase was used by middle-class speakers in conversation in the UK the 1950s and ’60s”, aided by its usage in works by Agatha Christie and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Dr+Seuss">Dr Seuss</a>.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew previously worked as a trade envoy for the UK, earning the nickname “Airmiles Andy” as he travelled the world, often at taxpayers’ expense, to hold events in the name of British business.</p>
      <p>The former Cameron aide, who championed tech policy while in Downing Street, left government in 2013 and now runs the co-working space Second Home. He recounted the meeting in his column for Evening Standard, which is edited by his former boss <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=George+Osborne">George Osborne</a>.</p>
      <p>He said this was the second Buckingham Palace meeting with Prince Andrew where he had felt uncomfortable with the language used.</p>
      <p>Mr Silva claimed the previous year Prince Andrew told him in another discussion on trade policy: “What you have got to remember is that you’ll never get anywhere by playing the white man.”</p>
      <p>Mr Silva added: “I genuinely didn’t know what he meant, and the discussion moved on. But the phrase ‘playing the white man’ stuck in my head, as I’d never heard it before. So when I got back to my desk, I immediately googled it. The definition flashed up on my screen: an old-fashioned saying, used during colonial times, meaning that only white people can be trusted to follow the rules, unlike dark-skinned natives.” – Guardian</p>
