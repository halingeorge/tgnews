      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 18 — German auto giant Volkswagen today predicted its sales revenues and pre-tax profit would be lower than expected in 2020 due to trade tensions and slowing global growth.</p>
      <p>The company said it was expecting an increase of 20 per cent in sales revenue and 30 per cent in pre-tax profit next year compared to 2016 levels.</p>
      <p>In the last update to its multi-year forecast, the company had predicted an increase of 25 per cent and 40 per cent for sales and profit respectively by 2020.</p>
      <p>The targets are not considered official annual forecasts, which VW has not yet released for next year.</p>
      <p>Investors were unimpressed with VW’s figures, with the company’s shares shedding 3.2 per cent to trade at €177.68 (RM816) around 1.30pm in Frankfurt (1230 GMT/8.30pm Malaysian time).</p>
      <p>“It’s fair to say that the very best of the party is over,” chief financial officer Frank Witter said in a conference call.</p>
      <p>“On the sales revenue, we have to acknowledge the changed economic framework conditions in the automotive markets,” Witter said, admitting there would have to be a “necessary adjustment” for VW.</p>
      <p>“Trade conflicts like Brexit and the tariff uncertainties, combined with the rising concern of a cooling of the global economy, have led us to take out five percentage points” from the revenue forecast.</p>
      <p>Witter said this would have “a knock-on effect” on profits.</p>
      <p>But he added: “We are still on track for a substantially better calendar year for 2020 compared to 2016.”</p>
      <p>Volkswagen last month said it expected deliveries this year to match the 2018 level rather than the slight growth forecast until now.</p>
      <p>Unit sales fell 1.5 per cent in the year to September, to around eight million.</p>
      <p>The group is attempting to turn the page on its “dieselgate” scandal, which cost it dear in both cash and reputational harm.</p>
      <p>Legal cases grind on over VW’s admission four years ago that it illegally fitted 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide with software to make them appear less polluting. — AFP</p>
