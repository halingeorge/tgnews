      <h1>PHOTOS: Deadly shooting at California football party</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:09:09+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.yahoo.com/author/yahoo-news-photo-staff" target="_blank">Yahoo News Photo Staff</a></address>
      <p>Four people were killed and six more wounded when “unknown suspects” sneaked into a backyard filled with people at a party in central California and fired into the crowd, police said.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place about 6 p.m. on the Fresno’s southeast side, where people were gathered to watch a football game, Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley said.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Michael Reid told the Fresno Bee and the KSEE/KGPE TV stations that a total of 10 people were shot, with three found dead in the backyard. A fourth person died at the hospital. Six others are expected to survive and are recovering at the hospital.</p>
      <p>All the victims were Asian men ranging from ages 25 to 35, Reid said.</p>
      <p>“What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard,” Dooley said. “Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.”</p>
      <p>The victims were taken to Community Regional Medical Center in critical condition, and some are now stable, the TV stations reported.</p>
      <p>About 35 people were at the party when the shooting began, Reid said.</p>
      <p>“Thank God that no kids were hurt,” he said.</p>
      <p>No one is in custody in connection with the shooting. Police said there was no immediate indication that the victims knew the shooter or shooters.</p>
      <p>Police were going door-to-door in search of surveillance video that might help them track down the suspects. The shooting took place about a half-mile from the city’s airport. (AP)</p>
