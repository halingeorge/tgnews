      <p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s Space Communications said on Monday its Amos-17 communication satellite, which was launched into space in August, has completed its in-orbit testing and reached its final position.</p>
      <p>Spacecom has suffered some major setbacks in recent years, including the loss of a satellite in 2016 when a SpaceX rocket exploded, and its shares were trading up 9% in Tel Aviv on Monday’s news.</p>
      <p>Amos-17 will provide communication services to Africa and should begin commercial operations in a matter of days, the company said.</p>
