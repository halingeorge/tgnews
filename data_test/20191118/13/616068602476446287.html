      <p>Cyclists and pedestrians will have a new way to travel starting next year. A multi-use pathway is now under construction along 15th Street and Middleton Way.</p>
      <p>The path is being made to increase safety for those travelling by pedal or on foot, and they will be physically separated from vehicle traffic with concrete barriers and posts. The barriers will be in place to ensure the safety of elementary and high school students who commute to school, along with everyone else who use alternatives to vehicles.</p>
      <p>"The construction of a protected pathway was identified as a top safety priority by residents during public engagement sessions on the City’s capital projects,” says Dwight Wright, the transportation technician and project manager. “The City is committed to expanding active transportation modes and we are pleased to get this project underway this year."</p>
      <p>The pathway that is currently under construction will be located between Kosmina Road and 21st Avenue. Before construction began, cyclists used bike lanes on both sides of the road, but there wasn't a place for pedestrians to walk. Pedestrians were then forced to walk along the shoulder.</p>
      <p>The project will be done in two phases, and is expected to be finished in the spring.</p>
