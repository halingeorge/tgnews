      <p>Liam Gallagher stood still in the centre of the stage with the hood of his parka over his head, surveying his adoring crowd.</p>
      <p>Chants of 'Liam! Liam! Liam!' rained down on the Oasis frontman after he brought a blockbuster set to a close at the Utilita Arena in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>While Noel Gallagher may always have been the songwriting genius behind Oasis, it was Liam's voice, attitude and charisma that made the Manchester group into one of the most important British bands of the nineties.</p>
      <p>It has been over 10 years since Oasis split up on that fateful night in Paris but Liam has certainly not lost any of his showmanship.</p>
      <p>He returned to Newcastle two years after his last sold-out tour, armed with a second successive number one album and a 20-song setlist that contained 11 Oasis classics.</p>
      <p>Chants of 'championies' from his beloved Manchester City players filled the arena before Gallagher and his band - including ex-Oasis guitarist Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs emerged. Oasis classic Rock n Roll Star got the ball rolling and set the tone for what was an incredible crowd atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Gallagher then ran through four solo songs and before he played Paper Crown from his first album As You Were, he paid tribute to Newcastle United's Longstaff brothers, drawing huge cheers from the Magpies fans in the room.</p>
      <p>The rip-roaring guitar riffs of Morning Glory were electrifying and he followed that up by playing two more Oasis classics in Columbia and Stand By Me.</p>
      <p>After a bit of a ropey start, Gallagher's vocal chords were suitably warmed up by this point and he delivered a beautiful rendition of Once, one of the lead singles from his new album Why Me? Why Not.</p>
      <p>Microphone issues forced two false starts on Be Still but Gallagher was quickly back on form with a stripped back acoustic version of first album track Greedy Soul.</p>

      <p>Oasis track Gas Panic! followed before Gallagher brought his main set to a close with 1995 classic Wonderwall.</p>
      <p>Gallagher returned for the encore and asked the crowd to help him out with Acquiesce given the lack of his older brother to sing the chorus. It was the first time he had played the track since 2006.</p>
      <p>He then introduced Roll With It with a tongue in cheek nod to Newcastle United and England legend Paul Gascoigne and the feud the song ignited between the pair involving a bowl of soup and a fire extinguisher.</p>
      <p>Supersonic followed before Gallagher told the crowd not to be 'silly billies' when informing them that his powerful version of Champagne Supernova would 'defo be the last song'.</p>
      <p>The crowd stayed and chanted for one more tune. Gallagher obliged, as he re-emerged for a second encore. The 47-year-old called the crowd 'biblical', thanked them for not being silly billies and apologised for 'not being 100 per cent'.</p>
      <p>He then tore into a rousing rendition of Cigarettes and Alcohol to finish an electrifying set. While his band closed out the show, he stood in the centre of the stage, taking in the moment, soaking up the adulation.</p>
      <p>His voice may not be as strong as it once was but he remains every bit the performer that saw Oasis shoot to global stardom in the nineties. While an Oasis reunion seems as far away as ever, Gallagher's solo shows remain the next best thing. And the appetite for more Liam Gallagher only continues to grow.</p>
