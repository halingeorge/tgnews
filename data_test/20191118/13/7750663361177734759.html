      <p>While the Catalan giants sit at the top of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/la-liga/table.html">La Liga standings</a>, Ernesto Valverde's side have come in for frequent criticism after a number of poor results.</p>
      <p>Barcelona will allegedly have to make sales before there can be any high-profile arrivals at Camp Nou, although it appears that the Spanish side are ready to conduct business at the midway point of the campaign.</p>
      <p>According to <i>La Nazione</i>, an offer could be made for Milenkovic, with Fiorentina said to be open to parting ways with one of their most prized assets.</p>
      <p>Despite the 22-year-old being a key man at Viola, the report claims that the Serie A outfit want to cash in on the Serbia international.</p>
      <p>Milenkovic still has over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract.</p>
