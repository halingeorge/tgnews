      <p>Having defended 38.2% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the 70.53-72.37 on the daily closing basis, the USD/INR pair managed to regain some positive traction on the first day of a new trading week.<br/> <br/>Currently hovering around the 71.60 region, the pair snapped two consecutive days of losing streak and recovered a part of the Friday's follow-through pullback from two-month tops.<br/> <br/>Bulls, however, struggled to build on the move beyond 100-day SMA, which is followed by 23.6% Fibo. level around the 71.95-72.00 region and should now act as a key pivotal point.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> maintained their bullish bias and have again started gaining positive momentum on hourly charts, support prospects for further gains.<br/> <br/>Hence, some follow-through strength, back towards monthly tops around the 72.35-40 region en-route September monthly peak near the 72.65 region, now looks a distinct possibility.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, the 71.65-60 region (38.2% Fibo. and also nearing 200-hour SMA) might continue to act as immediate support, which if broken might negate the near-term constructive outlook.<br/> <br/>Below the mentioned support, the pair is likely to slide further below 50% Fibo. towards testing the 71.20 confluence support, comprising of 61.8% Fibo. and two-week-old ascending trend-line.</p>
