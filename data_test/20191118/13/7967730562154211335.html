      <h1>Please feel free to withhold your smug attitudes to online dating</h1>

      <p>RECENTLY, during a catch up with a long-married former colleague, my dining companion leaned in whispered something in a conspiratorial tone I thought was pretty damn mean.</p>
      <p>“Remember (name deleted for privacy)? Well, I heard she’s on Tinder…”</p>
      <p>“And?” I replied, incredulous.</p>
      <p>“She goes on dates with strange men she meets online. It’s all a bit sad and desperate?”</p>

      <p>“Really?” I responded tersely. “I say good on her. She’s a great girl and deserves to find love or, at least have some fun along the way.”</p>
      <p>This condescending view of online dating from those who have no idea what it’s like being single in these times is one I loathe, a smug, superior attitude that I don’t wish to hear or acknowledge – and thankfully, normally don’t. This is because it’s so outdated it should come with a Blockbuster membership and some scented hair gel; a nasty anachronism of an ignorant earlier era.</p>
      <blockquote>More than four and a half million Australians have already tried online dating which is a hell of a lot of so-called 'desperate'.</blockquote>
      <p>Today, anyone who isn’t on a dating app when they are single (although a lot in relationships are on line too) is missing out in my mind. And, with some of the most famous actors, singers and business leaders the world over also online dating, often with great success, more fool anyone who looks down on this form of introduction.</p>
      <p>Anastasia Panayiotidis, a psychologist and relationship expert of some 30 years and General Manager of Clinical Services for Relationships Australia’s Victorian operations, agrees that the days of dating sites being viewed as domains of the desperate and demented are well and truly over and today, with meeting someone on an app the “new norm”.</p>

      <p>“It’s the disco, pub or club of the old days and, just like with going out and meeting someone on the bar, there will be people you are attracted to and people you’re not,” she says. “But in some ways it's better as you know something about the person before you meet them and, you get to meet people you otherwise wouldn’t, meaning horizons get expanded and new paths open.</p>
      <p>“Not that you can’t have an amazing and fulfilling life being single – you most definitely can! But another great aspect of online dating is you can choose the type of relationship you want, be it committed or casual, with someone with similar desires and goals.</p>
      <p>"And, let’s face it, getting out and mingling with others and meeting new people is much better than staying at home feeling lonely and depressed.”</p>
      <p>Hear hear!</p>
      <p>A 2017 study from Relationships Australia found online dating is the second most preferred way to meet a new partner behind introductions through family and friends. Those who used the sites commented that the advantages of internet dating include: convenience and ease of access to a large number of potential partners – particularly for individuals interested in partners of a specific orientation, lifestyle, or those in isolated areas; the opportunity for determining common interests and chatting before actually meeting face-to-face; the chance to control the seriousness and speed of relationships being sought; and access to the compatibility "matching" profiles of many sites.</p>
      <blockquote>I have attended two weddings of couples of who have met on line and I know several others de facto or otherwise committed relationships.</blockquote>
      <p>More than four and a half million Australians have already tried online dating – in the US that number is 49 million or one in five of the population – which is a hell of a lot of so-called “desperate” as my dining partner might view them.</p>
      <p>I have attended two weddings of couples of who have met online and I know several others in de facto or otherwise committed relationships. One is now happily married to a surgeon, another to a great bloke who has become one of my best mates. Another is looking to move overseas after meeting her fella online simply to have some dinner company while travelling for work.</p>
      <p>None of these people were "left on the shelf” types (what a vile term that is!) or otherwise crying themselves to sleep at night after eating gallons of ice cream. They are discerning types who haven’t wanted to settle until it was right, or simply wanted to enjoy single life to the fullest. A drop dead gorgeous actress/model I had interviewed years ago and recently ran into is another case in point.</p>
      <p>Over wine, she told me how she has found love online using the dating app <a href="https://nylon.com/articles/celebrities-on-raya-app">Raya</a>. Explaining she found it hard to find a partner in her circle, or guys only wanted to date her because of the way she looks, she had no issue with applying to the site that is known as celebrity Tinder for its famous members, allegedly including "losers" such as Elijah Woods, Ruby Rose, Matthew Perry, Alexander Wang, Sharon Stone, Zach Braff, Moby, Ben Affleck, Cara Delevingne and Patrick Schwarzenegger. It is said - be-still-my-thumping-heart - even actor John Cusack uses Raya!</p>
      <blockquote>None of these were 'left on the shelf' types ... They are discerning types who haven’t wanted to settle until it was right.</blockquote>
      <p>Homegrown beauty, actress Olympia Valance, certainly does, openly admitting to meeting her now de facto, Essendon player Thomas Bellchambers, on Raya. When asked how many other famous types she spotted on there, she answered: “Oh my God, so many people … There were some really big stars,” adding the hint of a very famous “race car driver”.</p>
      <p>While Raya might be where you find yourself a famous person, there are apps now that can hook you up with similar types be it by: religion, age, height, hobby, sexuality, profession, music taste, location, ethnicity, disability, body type ...</p>
      <p>However, as with traditional mating and relating, online dating does have its downsides. “I like to say that there are plenty of fish out there but there are sharks, too,” Panayiotidis warns. “There are several things you must do to keep safe and that is beware of scammers who may post fake identities.</p>

      <p>"These types never want to meet up or can’t, or ask you for money. So, never take someone’s online profile as gospel – and that goes for everyone out there until you have built up trust. Some people say they are not married when they are as well so be honest about what you want and don’t and make sure that is clear from the start.</p>
      <p>"But the best advice of all is to always meet up for the first time in a public place. Remember, you actually don’t know the person you have been contacting and they could be anyone. Always play it safe until trust and respect is built up.”</p>
      <p>In terms of looking after your mental health, Panayiotidis says rejection is common and shouldn’t be taken too much to heart. “Remember that these people haven’t actually met you so if you get rejected, you can’t take it personally as it could be for so many reasons. Online dating is a lolly shop with so much choice and so, people do move on. It also takes a lot of work, staying in touch, texting, scheduling meetings … it can get frustrating when people just disappear or change their minds but it’s also very common. My advice is move on if that happens, as that person obviously wasn’t right for you, and there will be someone more suitable out there”.</p>
      <p>So to my snobby colleague I say this: I shall now get my profile up online and get out to mingle more too (it’s only been ambivalence and lack of time that has stopped me thus far) and join the ranks you look down upon. And when I turn up with John Cusack at your next dinner party, I wonder just how desperate I will appear then?</p>
