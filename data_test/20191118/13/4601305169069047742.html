      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:00:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/boingboingstore" target="_blank">Boing Boing's Shop</a></address>
      <p>Seems like no matter what kind of wireless earbud you buy, you're sacrificing something: Sound for longevity, battery life for durability, the list goes on.</p>
      <p>Finally, it seems like the tech is starting to come together for the full package in a few newer models. Case in point: These <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/pamu-slide-bluetooth-5-in-ear-headphones-with-wireless-charger-black?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=pamu-slide-bluetooth-5-in-ear-headphones-with-wireless-charger-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-346673&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004Mrke&amp;scsonar=1">PaMu Slide Bluetooth 5 In-Ear Headphones</a>.</p>
      <p>If you couldn't tell from the looks, these are definite ear-huggers, with a design that ensures they won't fall out no matter how intense the workout gets. And they're rated IPX6 for water-resistance, which means the sweat won't slow them down.</p>

      <p>As for the sound, the highs and lows are well-balanced, bolstered by the solid 5.0 Bluetooth connectivity. Best of all, the battery life is long enough to outlast any workout and a marathon to boot: You've got 10 hours just on the earbuds alone, and that goes up to 60 hours if you use the accompanying wireless charger.</p>
      <p>They're already on sale for almost <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/pamu-slide-bluetooth-5-in-ear-headphones-with-wireless-charger-black?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=pamu-slide-bluetooth-5-in-ear-headphones-with-wireless-charger-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-346673&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004Mrke&amp;scsonar=1">half off the original list price</a> of $199.00, and you can take an extra 15% off by using the <b>online code BFSAVE15</b>, bringing the final price down to $84.99.</p>
