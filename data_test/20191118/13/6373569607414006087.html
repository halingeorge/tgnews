      <h1>MoD responds as UK Armed Forces face international war crimes probe</h1>
      <h2>MoD says claims killings of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq have been covered up are untrue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:04:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">PA, Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has said it may investigate the British military for the first time after allegations that war crimes had been committed, it has been reported.</p>
      <p>A BBC Panorama programme claims that killings of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq have been covered up by the state. In response, The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said the claims are untrue.</p>
      <p>Plymouth parliamentary candidate and Defence minister Johnny Mercer, who says PM Boris Johnson has tasked him with ending the legal pursuit of former service personnel, retweeted the MoD's response. </p>
      <p>In July, Mr Mercer told The Sun: "I’m delighted with the role. The PM has tasked me to end the repeated and vexatious pursuit of veterans by so-called Lawfare and to put together legislation to place the Forces covenant into law, in line with a pledge first made by the Conservative Party in 2009."</p>
      <p>However, BBC Panorama says leaked documents allegedly contain evidence implicating British troops in killing children and the torture of civilians.</p>
      <p>The recent BBC/Sunday Times investigation said it had obtained new evidence from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British soldiers in Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Mr Mercer has been a vocal critic of the Historical Investigations Unit, which has looked into allegations of misconduct by service personnel as well as unsolved criminal cases stemming from The Troubles.</p>
      <p>The Government closed IHAT and Operation Northmoor in 2017, after Phil Shiner, a solicitor who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off from practising law amid allegations that he had paid people in Iraq to find clients.</p>
      <p>But some former IHAT and Operation Northmoor investigators said Mr Shiner's actions were used as an excuse to close down the inquiries.</p>
      <p>No case investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor has led to a prosecution.</p>
      <p>The ICC said it has taken the accusations "very seriously", according to the BBC.</p>
      <p>"The ICC said it would independently assess the BBC's findings and would begin a landmark case if it believed the Government was shielding soldiers from prosecution," the corporation reported on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The ICC has previously concluded it was credible that British troops committed war crimes in Iraq related to the mistreatment of detainees.</p>
      <p>The year-long investigation claims to have found evidence of murders by an SAS soldier, as well as deaths in custody, beatings, torture and sexual abuse of detainees by members of the Black Watch.</p>
      <p>A senior SAS commander was referred to prosecutors for attempting to pervert the course of justice, the investigation claims.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "Allegations that have been made that the MoD interfered in investigations of the prosecutions are untrue.</p>
      <p>"The service police carried out an extensive investigation into allegations about the conduct of forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>"The independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute any of the cases referred to it."</p>
      <p>A Ministry of Defence Spokesperson said:</p>
      <p>“Allegations that the MOD interfered with investigations or prosecution decisions relating to the conduct of UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are untrue. Throughout the process the decisions of prosecutors and the investigators have been independent of the MOD and involved external oversight and legal advice.</p>
      <p>“Cases were referred to the Service Prosecuting Authority as a result of investigations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Cases from Iraq were referred as a result of historic investigations. It is untrue to claim cases investigated under Operation Northmoor in Afghanistan were not acted upon. After careful investigation, overseen by a former Chief Constable, no Northmoor cases were referred to prosecutors.</p>
      <p>“The Service Police have carried out extensive investigations into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute any of the cases referred to it.</p>
      <p>“Our military served with great courage and professionalism in Iraq and Afghanistan and we hold them to the highest standards. It is Government policy that military operations are conducted in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict and where allegations are raised, they are investigated.</p>
      <p>“The Sunday Times’ claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations.”</p>
      <p>Panorama: War Crimes Scandal Exposed will be screened on BBC One on Monday at 9pm.</p>
