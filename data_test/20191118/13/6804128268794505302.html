      <h1>Declan Rice insists he can play alongside Spurs midfielder after more England criticism</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers midfielder was blasted by Roy Keane prior to England's win over Kosovo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Declan Rice has insisted that he and Spurs midfielder Harry Winks are more than capable of playing in the same England team as the West Ham star has come in for some harsh stick yet again.</p>
      <p>Rice had been dropped to the bench for England's previous two internationals against Bulgaria and Montenegro before being reinstated back to the starting lineup for the 4-0 victory over Kosovo on Sunday night where he started alongside Winks in the England midfield.</p>
      <p>Prior to the game, Irishman Roy Keane had laid into Rice for a second time in recent weeks as he said in his role as a pundit on ITV: "Where he needs to improve, there are plenty of aspects if you think about it.</p>
      <p>"Over the last few months he has had a lot of praise, I worked with him while he was with the Ireland squad.</p>
      <p>"Where does he need to improve, where do you want me to start? His positional play I don’t think is consistent enough, he doesn't stay with runners, he'S sloppy in possession.</p>
      <p>“I can go on."</p>
      <p>It's not the first time Keane has singled out Rice for criticism as the 20-year-old has suffered a dip in form for his club who have gone six games without a win in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Rice switched his allegiance from Ireland to England in Febraury and has been a part of every squad picked by Gareth Southgate since the Hammers midfielder made his decision.</p>

      <p>Winks got off the mark for his country by scoring the first goal in the comfortable win which put the gloss on a successful Euro 2020 qualifying campaign for the Three Lions.</p>
      <p>Rice, speaking to the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/declan-rice-hits-back-at-england-defence-critics-we-know-how-good-we-are-a4289716.html">Evening Standard</a> after the win in Kosovo, said that he and Winks have a good connection on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people of the outside see it as competition but I'm really good friends with Harry Winks and when he plays I'm happy for him," the Hammers midfielder said.</p>
      <p>"I played with him for the first time last night and we were speaking afterwards saying how much we enjoyed it. We were both want to keep the ball, keep it simple. To play with him last night and form that connection was good. It's healthy."</p>
