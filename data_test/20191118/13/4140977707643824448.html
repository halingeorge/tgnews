          <p>India will play Oman in the upcoming world cup qualifier match. India is in desperate need to fetch their first victory in the qualifiers as they have failed to bag three points even once.</p>
          <p>On paper, India should have won against Afghanistan and Bangladesh, considering the FIFA rankings and their previous performances against these sides.</p>

                <p>Especially against Bangladesh, as India played the game at home but were about to lose the match, but a late header by Adil Khan prevented India dealing with a catastrophe.</p>
                <p>Further, the same fate was against Afghanistan as India secured a draw in a late dramatic fashion after a headed strike by Seminlen Doungel, although, tough away condition can be understood as the reason behind the final score.</p>

                      <p>Nevertheless, India is at a delicate position ahead of the 4th round of the qualifiers. Moreover, Oman has always been a tough opposition for India, and since it will be an away match, things are even worse for the Blue Tigers.</p>
                      <p>Last time, Oman faced India, the South Asian champions faced a major heartbreak after conceding two late goals which eventually led to their defeat even though India was leading for the most part of the game.</p>

                          <p>Thus, a very crucial game for India if they want to qualify in the next round of the qualifiers, but the chances are slim for Igor Stimac’s side to defeat Oman at their own den.</p>
