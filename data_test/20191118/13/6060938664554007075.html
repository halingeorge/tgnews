      <p>NEW DELHI: Heavy industries and public enterprises minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday said a total of 11.7 million vehicles of all categories were sold this year as against 14.1 million units in the April-September 2018 period, but <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/festive-demand">festive demand</a> this year led to a 0.3 per cent growth in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/passenger-vehicles">passenger vehicles</a> segment.</p>
      <p>"There are cyclical slowdowns in many economies. 11.7 million vehicles (all categories) were sold in this year as against 14.1 million vehicles during April-September of 2018. But the festival demand has shown year-on-year growth at 0.3 per cent in the passenger vehicle segment," Javadekar said in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>The government, as a policymaker, always attempts to keep and improve the momentum of the economy through a package of measures for comprehensive and continued development of the industry as and when required, Javadekar added.</p>
