      <p>Having been kept at Stamford Bridge by recently-appointed boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a>, Batshuayi has contributed five goals from two starts and nine substitute outings in all competitions.</p>
      <p>However, despite needing to maintain his sharpness ahead of Euro 2020, the Belgium international has indicated that he is settled at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old is quoted by <i>The Metro</i> as saying: "I have never been a full-fledged starter, but Chelsea is my club, that's where I feel at home. It's a club I love deeply."</p>
      <p>Batshuayi will hope to feature when Chelsea take on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening.</p>
