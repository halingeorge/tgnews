      <h1>Everton planning move for Sheffield United defender John Egan?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/sheffield-united/"><b>Sheffield United</b></a> defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-egan/"><b>John Egan</b></a> has reportedly emerged as a transfer target for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/everton/"><b>Everton</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Egan has made a strong start to life in the Premier League, helping the newly-promoted Blades into fifth position in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">top-flight standings</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the form of the Republic of Ireland international has inevitably led to interest in his signature ahead of 2020.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Sun</i>, Everton plan to monitor the progress of the 27-year-old over the coming months as they contemplate a potential approach in January.</p>
      <p>Despite United now being able to attract a significant offer for Egan's services, the former Brentford man is unlikely to leave Bramall Lane at the midway point of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Egan still has over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract.</p>
