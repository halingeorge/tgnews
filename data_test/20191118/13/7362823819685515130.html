      <p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado">Colorado</a> investigating a possible <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">killing</a> at an apartment in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">Denver</a> neighborhood made a grisly discovery on Friday when they located the body of an adult male <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news">encased in concrete</a> in the basement, according to officials.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Adams County Sheriff's Office</a> said in a news release that detectives had obtained a search warrant for an apartment on York Street in unincorporated Adams County after receiving information from the Arvada Police Department regarding a possible <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">shooting</a> that took place at the location on Nov. 8.</p>
      <p>A SWAT team served the search warrant at the apartment on Thursday afternoon and arrested 38-year-old Russell Montoya Jr. inside.</p>
      <p>"A search of the residence and multiple interviews have confirmed that a shooting and homicide occurred inside the apartment," the <a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sr2j26">sheriff's office said</a>.</p>

      <p>As members of the Adams County Sheriff’s Office Crime Scene and Laboratory Team were processing the crime scene inside the apartment, investigators located the body of an adult male victim “encased” in concrete in the basement of the apartment, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AdamsSheriffCO/posts/2767545043279089">officials said on Friday</a>.</p>

      <p>"ACSO personnel will work in conjunction with members of the Coroner’s Office to remove the decedent from residence," the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AdamsSheriffCO/posts/2767545043279089">sheriff's office said</a>. People in Hazmat suits could be seen removing a "very large" body bag from the apartment on Friday, according to KDVR.</p>
      <p>Neighbors said there was a lot of activity at the apartment, but they never suspected anything as grisly as what authorities described.</p>
