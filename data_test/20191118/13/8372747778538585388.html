      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. -- City leaders will talk about giving money to several non-profits in the city.</p>
      <p>As we reported months ago, the city cut funding for the Quality Life Center and more than 30 other community organizations.</p>
      <p>Instead, the city diverted those funds to the Stars Complex, which the city runs.</p>
      <p>Now, the city council agenda says they will talk about how money from Ward 2's discretionary fund may go towards five organizations.</p>
      <p>If approved, each would get $1,000.</p>
      <p>That council meeting is Monday night.</p>
