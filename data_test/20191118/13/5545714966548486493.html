      <p>Arc System Works has released the opening movie for its upcoming fighting game revision <i>Under Night In-Birth: Exe:Late [cl-r]</i> which is headed to PS4 and Nintendo Switch in 2020.<br/><br/>Going from 0-100 in the first millisecond (in true anime fashion) the dramatic opening re-introduces us to every member of the<i> Under Night In-Birth: Exe:Late [cl-r]</i> roster, from the hammer-fisted Mika and the fiery Carmine, to schoolboy samurai Hyde and the beautiful but highly-dangerous Hilde. We also get to see <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../under-night-in-birth-exe-late-cl-r-confirmed-for-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-566043.phtml">new kid Londrekia</a>, who is the only roster addition this time around.<br/><br/>These are more characters are showcased for our viewing pleasure, backed by a loud, excitable opening theme "Itsuwari no Mugen Heiretsu (Parareal)." Sung by Sakura Ishadou, the fast-paced track captures the frenetic energy and melodrama of the anime fighting series.<i> <br/><br/>Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[cl-r] </i>launches in Japan for PS4 and Nintendo Switch on February 20, before heading west later in 2020. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../under-night-in-birth-exe-late-cl-r-collector-s-edition-available-to-pre-order-568296.phtml">A special collector's edition</a> is also available for pre-order.</p>
