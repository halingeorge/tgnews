      <h1>Vodafone Idea to raise mobile services rates from December 1</h1>
      <h2>The company, however, did not disclose the range or details of the proposed tariff hike.</h2>

      <p>Debt-ridden telecom operator Vodafone Idea on Monday said it will raise mobile services rates from December 1 in the wake of ongoing financial stress.</p>
      <p>“To ensure that its customers continue to enjoy world class digital experiences, Vodafone Idea will suitably increase the prices of its tariffs effective from December 1, 2019,” Vodafone Idea said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The company, however, did not disclose the range or details of the proposed tariff hike. Vodafone Idea last week reported consolidated loss of Rs.50,921 crore – highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate – for the second quarter ended September 30, on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court order in the adjusted gross revenue case.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court last month ruled in favour of the government and directed telecom companies, including Vodafone Idea, to pay dues as demanded by the Department of Telecom.</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea said that now its ability to continue business will depend on relief sought from the government and positive outcome of the legal option it has.</p>
      <p>“The acute financial stress in the telecom sector has been acknowledged by all stakeholders and a high level Committee of Secretaries (CoS) headed by the Cabinet Secretary is looking into providing appropriate relief,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea has around 300 million mobile subscribers.</p>
