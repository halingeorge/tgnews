      <h1>Prince Andrew faces new criticism over friendship with Jeffery Epstein</h1>

      <p><b>(CBS) - </b>Britain's Prince Andrew is facing backlash after a widely criticized tv interview about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who committed suicide earlier this year. The royal is facing calls to apologize for comments he made.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew may have intended to close the book on his relationship with Jeffery Epstein with a sitdown interview, but instead, he's opened himself up to new criticism.</p>
      <p>"I suppose his behavior was unbecoming," Prince Andrew said.</p>
      <p>"Unbecoming?" the interviewer responded. "He's a convicted sex offender."</p>
      <p>A photo from 2001 appears to show the prince with then underage Virginia Giuffre. She claims she was trafficked to the Duke of York for sex.</p>
      <p>"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever," Prince Andrew said.</p>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth's son also says he never noticed anything suspicious on Epstein's private island, his private plane, or at either of his homes, including a New York mansion he stayed at for days after Epstein was released from prison.</p>
      <p>"It was a convenient place to stay," he explained.</p>
      <p>It's rare for any member of the royal family to sit down for this kind of interview. But it seems to have backfired, with British media commentators and P.R. experts calling it a disaster</p>
      <p>"My guess is that he bulldozed his way in and decided he was going to do it himself without any advice," said Dickie Aribiter, former Buckingham Palace press officer</p>
      <p>Asked if he regrets his friendship with the convicted pedophile, Prince Andrew said no.</p>
      <p>"Now, still not and the reason being is that the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful," he said.</p>
      <p>There are also calls for Prince Andrew to talk to U.S. investigators about his relationship with Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, the woman some of the victims accuse of trafficking them.</p>
