      <p>On Friday, many fans were left disappointed after the Zimbabwe Warriors drew their home match against Botswana in an AFCON qualifier. Given that Botswana is regarded as the weakest team in the group, fans felt justified to feel hard done by the Warriors failure to win following a tepid performance.</p>
      <p>Ironically, however, it has been revealed that a member of the Warriors technical bench had a bottle of juju which he used to open when Zimbabwe was attacking. When the visitors were attacking, the official would quickly close the bottle in the belief that this would magically seal Zimbabwe’s defence and stop Botswana from scoring.</p>
      <p>These sordid details were revealed in an expose by the state-owned<a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/warriors-bizarre-rituals-on-a-night-of-shame/"> Herald</a>. According to the publication, a source from the team said,</p>
      <aside>It was like we were watching a Nigerian movie. I don’t think anyone on that bench, and there were many professionals, has ever seen anything like that.<br/>It might sound like fiction but that’s exactly what was happening all the time and watching it, again and again, gave this impression that we have really sunk low as a team.<br/>If we have now believed that such Stone Age antics are what can make the difference between winning and losing then surely we have lost the plot.<br/>Of course, every African team has its rituals but this was the first time where I saw it being practised on the bench in full view of all the players and the other technical staff members.<br/>I kept thinking, just as well the bulk of what you guys call the British Brigade didn’t come for this match because I kept wondering what impression they would have taken back about our team if they had watched all that.<br/>People have argued over this for years now — if all this belief in magic works, why is it an African team has never come even close to winning the World Cup?</aside>
