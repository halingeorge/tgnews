      <h1>Report: Arsenal leading Manchester United in race to sign £34m-rated Merih Demiral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:51:21+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/milli-yildizlara-hucum-2102656">Turkish newspaper Fanatik have claimed</a> that Arsenal have ‘already shaken hands’ on a deal to sign Turkish defender Merih Demiral from Juventus for a fee of £34million – despite interest from Manchester United and AC Milan.</p>
      <p>Demiral, 21, has endured a difficult start to life at Juventus after joining the Italian champions from Sassuolo in the summer. New signing Matthijs de Ligt has pushed Demiral down the rankings, as the Dutchman impresses in the starting XI.</p>
      <p>Juve also boast Daniele Rugani, Leonardo Bonucci and veteran Giorgio Chiellini. It has left Demiral with little chance of breaking into Maurizio Sarri’s side – Demiral has managed just one appearance so far, a Serie A win over Verona.</p>
      <p>With the defender also causing a slight bit of controversy after sporting director Pavel Nedved had to defend the centre-back’s decision to do a military salute during a match for Turkey – alongside a number of his teammates.</p>
      <p>Despite having a contract at Juve until the summer of 2024, Arsenal, Man United and Milan are keen to end his Juventus spell early. It is believed that Arsenal have moved quickest, already agreeing a deal to sign the player.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Demiral has the potential to solve Arsenal crisis</h3>
      <p>Unai Emery is a clever tactician and surely he would have noticed that Arsenal needed fixing in defence in the summer. However, he chose to buy one of the most error-strewn Premier League defenders in David Luiz.</p>
      <p>Obviously, the defensive problems still arise. But the commanding, powerful Demiral has both the quality and the potential to fix those issues and change Arsenal’s defence for the first time in years. At £34million, he is a bargain.</p>
