      <h1>Claro will let you pay for Galaxy Store goods using your carrier account</h1>

      <p>Samsung fans in Colombia will have the option to pay for <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-store/">Galaxy Store</a> goods using their prepaid and postpaid data plans. Colombia’s largest mobile carrier, Claro, is now collaborating with DOCOMO Digital – NTT DOCOMO’s holding company – to put this new payment method in the customer’s hands.</p>
      <h3>No credit card will be required for Galaxy Store purchases</h3>
      <p>One of the advantages offered by this new payment method is that Claro customers and Samsung Galaxy fans will not be required to use a credit card for Galaxy Store purchases. They can simply use their Claro balance, and therefore, the service promises a more straightforward experience to both prepaid and postpaid users.</p>
      <p>This latest bit of news comes via tech blog <a href="https://www.thefastmode.com/technology-solutions/15899-claro-colombia-partners-with-docomo-digital-to-facilitate-carrier-billing-for-samsung-galaxy-store"><i>The Fast Mode</i></a> but, as yet, there’s no official word on when Claro and Samsung customers will be able to use this alternative payment method for Galaxy Store purchases. Whatever the case may be, it does sound like a good idea particularly for emerging markets, so it is possible, at least in theory, that Claro won’t be the last carrier to offer this type of service.</p>
      <p>Would you like to be able and pay for Galaxy Store goods with using your carrier account and prepaid/postpaid balance in your country? Would you prefer this payment method over the existing ones? Let us know in the comment section below.</p>
