        <b>On Tuesday, the latest version of Football Manager was released – and as with every football-related game out there, we are keen to find out how they have answered the eternal Lionel Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo debate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And thanks to <a href="https://www.givemesport.com/1522468-comparing-cristiano-ronaldo-and-lionel-messis-stats-on-football-manager-2020"><i>GiveMeSport</i></a>, it looks like we now have an answer to the above question – as they performed a detailed breakdown of all the 36 individual stats in the game to see who has been rated the better of the two, and in which departments.</p>
      <p>Each attribute is rated out of 20, with 1 being the worst possible score and 20 being the best.</p>
      <p>Check out the detailed breakdown right below:</p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL STATS</b><br/><b>Corners: </b>Messi 15-13 Ronaldo<br/><b>Crossing:</b> Messi 15-15 Ronaldo<br/><b>Dribbling: </b>Messi 20-15 Ronaldo<br/><b>Finishing: </b>Messi 20-19 Ronaldo<br/><b>First Touch: </b>Messi 19-17 Ronaldo<br/><b>Free-kicks: </b>Messi 19-15 Ronaldo<br/><b>Heading: </b>Ronaldo 19-10 Messi<br/><b>Long shots: </b>Ronaldo 19-17 Messi<br/><b>Long throws: </b>Messi 4-2 Ronaldo<br/><b>Marking: </b>Messi 4-3 Ronaldo<br/><b>Passing: </b>Messi 20-15 Ronaldo<br/><b>Penalty taking: </b>Ronaldo 20-17 Messi<br/><b>Tackling: </b>Ronaldo 8-7 Messi<br/><b>Technique: </b>Messi 20-17 Ronaldo</p>
      <p><b>MENTAL STATS</b><br/><b>Aggression:</b> Messi 7-6 Ronaldo<br/><b>Anticipation:</b> Messi 19-18 Ronaldo<br/><b>Bravery:</b> Ronaldo 16-10 Messi<br/><b>Composure:</b> Messi 18-14 Ronaldo<br/><b>Concentration:</b> Ronaldo 16-13 Messi<br/><b>Decisions:</b> Messi 20-18 Ronaldo<br/><b>Determination:</b> Messi 20-20 Ronaldo<br/><b>Flair:</b> Messi 20-18 Ronaldo<br/><b>Leadership</b>: Ronaldo 17-14 Messi<br/><b>Off the ball:</b> Ronaldo 18-16 Messi<br/><b>Positioning:</b> Ronaldo 6-5 Messi<br/><b>Teamwork:</b> Messi 14-10 Ronaldo<br/><b>Vision:</b> Messi 20-14 Ronaldo<br/><b>Work rate</b>: Ronaldo 10-7 Messi</p>
      <p><b>PHYSICAL STATS</b><br/><b>Acceleration:</b> Messi 18-15 Ronaldo<br/><b>Agility:</b> Messi 20-13 Ronaldo<br/><b>Balance:</b> Messi 20-14 Ronaldo<br/><b>Jumping Reach:</b> Ronaldo 18-6 Messi<br/><b>Natural fitness:</b> Ronaldo 20-14 Messi<br/><b>Pace:</b> Ronaldo 16-15 Messi<br/><b>Stamina:</b> Ronaldo 15-13 Messi<br/><b>Strength:</b> Ronaldo 16-9 Messi</p>
      <p>Out of the 36 attributes discussed above, Messi has a better rating in nineteen attributes and Ronaldo has a better rating in fifteen. Both players are tied with each other in two attributes.</p>
      <p>That being said, it looks like Lionel Messi is the better player on Football Manager 2020 – but let’s hold that thought.</p>
      <p><i>GiveMeSport</i> has also hinted that, interestingly, when one adds up all the stats together for both players separately, both of them have a total of 525 points each.</p>
      <p>It looks like even Football Manager could not find a solution to the eternal Messi-Ronaldo debate, after all.</p>
