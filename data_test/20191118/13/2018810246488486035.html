      <p>Perhaps spooked by the fact the only people who seem to care about the impending launch of their Stadia home streaming platform <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/google-confirms-all-the-stuff-stadia-wont-have-at-launch">are those noting everything wrong with it</a>, Google has at the 11th hour — this thing is released in two days, on November 19! — almost doubled the number of games that’ll be available when it goes live.</p>
      <p>Originally intending to launch with 12 games, Google will now be releasing 22, with the extra ten—including titles such as <i>NBA 2K20</i>, <i>Final Fantasy XV</i> and <i>Rage 2</i>—having been bumped up from the list of titles that were originally expected to come to Stadia “later in 2019". The service still isn't scheduled to come to Australia, either.</p>
