      <p>“<b>Eugene and I have been together for the past three years and we decided to tie the knot this year. I knew him very well before we came together as man and wife. I was so sure about him before we got married, s</b>he added.</p>
      <p><b>“We wanted to keep our relationship on the low and surprise our loved one and that is exactly what we did,”</b> she told <b>Graphic Showbiz</b>.</p>
      <p>The pair married on Tuesday, June 11 at the Rehab Beach Club, Labadi, Accra.</p>
