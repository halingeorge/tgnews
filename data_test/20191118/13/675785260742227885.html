      <h1>Roy Keane lauds Man Utd striker Marcus Rashford after latest England goal</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd's Marcus Rashford found the net for England after coming off the bench and impressed Roy Keane which is no easy feat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:04:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> captain Roy Keane believes Marcus Rashford has to start for England at Euro 2020 after his goal against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old scored England's third with a sweetly struck first time strike as the Three Lions won on the road.</p>
      <p>And Keane, who is not easily impressed, heaped praise on Rashford who has begun to find his goalscoring touch once again.</p>
      <p>“Brilliant, brilliant goal,” the ex-United midfielder told ITV Sport.</p>

      <p>“What a finish. He is back to his best. It was a lovely play, nice and simple. Does it matter about the opposition? Of course, it does, because they’re getting opportunities, but that was the goal of the night.</p>
      <p>"A lovely finish. Pure quality.”</p>
      <p>Rashford has plenty of competition for a starting berth in England's attack with Gareth Southgate spoilt for choice.</p>
      <p>Against Kosovo he gave Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi a start with Rashford appearing off the bench.</p>

      <p>But when it comes to the crunch games Keane is in no doubt that Rashford has to be part of a three-pronged attack featuring Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>“The attacking three players you’d have at the minute are Sterling, Kane and Rashford," he added.</p>
      <p>"The three of them are outstanding players who cause you all sorts of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/rid-your-headache-migraine-just-8733302">headaches</a> .”</p>
      <p>Kane also found the back of the net on Sunday night to become the first Englishman to score in every qualifier and will be vital if the Three Lions are to taste glory at Wembley come July.</p>
      <p>Southgate reckons his side are further ahead that they were in Russia last year when they reached the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>He said: "We're definitely further ahead than we were heading into Russia, but we made massive strides in this period when we went into Russia.</p>
      <p>"We've got to make sure that, to get the level of performance next summer, we're going to have to improve in the way that we did over that spell as well."</p>
