      <h1>These are Africa’s seven independence leaders who were intellectuals in their own rights</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:00:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nii Ntreh</a></address>
      <p>It is a thankless job to insist on the difference between “intellectual” and “intelligent”. One word conjures an understanding carried by the other even if what is meant is particularly different.</p>
      <p>The two words are, of course, linked in a way, and may sometimes even be sufficiently synonymous but they are not the same.</p>
      <p>For purposes of this list, “intellectual” refers to the high-mindedness scholars tend to display on topics. In books, speeches and other literature, intellectuals tend to be particular about their argument, in the end espousing a whole philosophy.</p>
      <p>So granted that all of Africa’s independence leaders were intelligent, we may not say they were all intellectually-inclined.</p>
      <p>This list may not include some of your favourites but you are invited to make your case as to why they should be there.</p>
