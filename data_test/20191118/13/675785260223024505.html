      <p>Shocking footage shows the aftermath of a deadly killer wasp attack that saw three people dead and five relatives injured when they were attacked after leaving a funeral.</p>
      <p>Eight men - all from the same family - were attacked by a swarm of wasps as they left a relative’s burial site in China’s southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on November 16.</p>
      <p>The group are thought to have been travelling by foot when they encountered the aggressive swarm near the village of Tangdu, according to Asia Wire.</p>
      <p>The harrowing footage shows two survivors lying on the ground crippled in pain as medics treat them.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of wasp sting marks can be seen dotted across the arms, face and body of one of the men receiving treatment. Both appear limp, weak and dazed after the violent attack.</p>
      <p>The sounds of a distraught relative can be heard in the background as medics tend to the victims.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the local fire service and forestry experts bag the wasp nest presumably to remove it from the site.</p>
      <p>The wasp species has not been revealed.</p>

      <p>The adults - all aged between 45 and 87 - were taken to two different hospitals in the region.</p>
      <p>A 70-year-old victim died of anaphylactic shock, a severe allergic reaction to the stings before the group were taken to Xingye People’s Hospital.</p>
      <p>Two more - aged 60 and 87 - had the same fate while at hospital. </p>
      <p>The five relatives that survived the agonising attack were taken to Yulin First People’s Hospital for treatment, where one remains in serious condition.</p>
      <p>Officials are investigating the case, according to a statement by China's municipal government.</p>
