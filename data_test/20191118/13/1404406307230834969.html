      <h1>Ja Rule Gets Dismissed from $100 Million Fyre Festival Lawsuit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:14:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author">VladTV</a></address>
      <p>According to reports, Ja Rule’s name has been cleared in the <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/256252/irv-gotti-on-ja-rules-involvement-in-fyre-festival-billy-scammed">Fyre Festival lawsuit</a> that was brought against Billy McFarland and others.</p>
      <p>In the past week, a judge sided with Ja Rule in the $100 million civil lawsuit, saying, “This Court rejected plaintiffs’ conclusory assertions that they relied on defendants’ representations about the Festival as insufficient to state a claim for fraud. In the case of Atkins, plaintiffs alleged an actionable false statement, but failed to allege that they acted in reliance thereon."</p>
      <p>The rapper’s attorney issued a statement, saying, “In July, the Court dismissed all Fyre Festival claims against Mr. Atkins. After this loss, plaintiffs’ law firm Geragos &amp; Geragos appealed that decision. Today, the Court denied their appeal. This ruling is nothing short of a total vindication of Mr. Atkins. -Ryan Hayden Smith attorney for Jeffrey Atkins p/k/a Ja Rule."</p>
