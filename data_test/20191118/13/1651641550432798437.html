      <h1>Hands-on video of Samsung’s upcoming foldable phone leaked online</h1>

      <p>A few days back, we <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/the-upcoming-galaxy-fold-2-will-be-cheaper-than-the-galaxy-fold/">reported</a> that Samsung is working on a cheaper Galaxy Fold smartphone, a hands-on video of which has recently leaked online(via <i><a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/samsung-w20-hands-on-leaks">Slashleaks</a></i>). Surprisingly, according to the leaked video, the upcoming foldable phone from Samsung will be called Samsung W20 and not Galaxy Fold 2 despite the fact that design-wise, both the devices look exactly the same.</p>

      <p>The duration of the video is only nine seconds and, therefore, it failed to give us key details about the W20 — the hands-on video showed just the front and back of the smartphone and we noticed nothing different in the W20.</p>
      <p>According to famous leaker <i>Max J.</i>, the W20 will have support for 5G, just like the original Galaxy Fold.</p>

      <p>Now that the Galaxy Fold-like W20 foldable phone is confirmed(sort of, because the leak has 100 percent trust score) to be in existence, a clamshell foldable smartphone from Samsung now seems more likely albeit Samsung may not call it Galaxy Fold 2.</p>
      <p>According to previous rumors, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-teases-clamshell-folding-galaxy-fold-2-at-sdc-2019/">Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 2 won’t look like the original Galaxy Fold</a> as the company is adopting a clamshell design. This means that Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 might share a similar design with the recently-launched Motorola RAZR folding smartphone. Rumor also has it that the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/the-samsung-galaxy-fold-2-will-likely-support-the-s-pen/">Galaxy Fold 2 will have support for the S Pen</a>.</p>
      <p>We still don’t know much about the W20 smartphone, but if forced to conjecture, I’d say it’ll be based on Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ processor. Samsung is also <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-camera-app-to-get-directors-view-mode-night-hyperlapse-single-take-photo-and-more/">working on many new camera features</a> and they may also come to this new W20 foldable smartphone.</p>
      <p>Samsung might showcase the W20 foldable phone at Mobile World Congress 2020.</p>
