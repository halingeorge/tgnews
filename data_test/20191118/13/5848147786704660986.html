      <h1>Rise in Australian arrests abroad: DFAT</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:33:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aine-fox/" target="_blank">Aine Fox</a></address>
      <p>The number of Australians arrested overseas is on the up, rising by a quarter in the past five years.</p>
      <p>The US, Thailand and China were the top three countries where citizens fell foul of the law, with a total of 1572 cases of arrest and immigration detention around the world in 2018-2019.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister Marise Payne, launching the annual <i>State of Play</i> report in Sydney on Monday, warned Australians to familiarise themselves with possible legal differences at their travel destinations.</p>
      <p>“Australians should be obliged to know and understand the laws of the countries in which they’re travelling, they won’t be the same as Australia,” Ms Payne told reporters.</p>
      <p>“There are differences all over the world and so the importance of knowing what the laws are where you are going, what you’re required to do is very, very important.”</p>
      <p>Of the 229 cases of Australians requiring consular assistance in the US, just more than half were immigration-related.</p>

      <p>There was a 30 per cent rise in arrest and detention cases in Thailand, which the department attributed to a tightening of the country’s immigration policy. Drug-related arrests in Thailand were also up.</p>
      <p>The Philippines and Indonesia replaced the UAE and Japan as the fourth and fifth most likely countries for Australians to be arrested.</p>
      <p>Cases of support for bereaved families whose loved ones have died overseas rose to 1695, an increase of almost one-third in the past five years, the report says.</p>
      <p>Most deaths were from natural causes or illness and happened in Thailand, which is in the top five most-visited countries by Australians.</p>
      <p>Some deaths also took place in the period before April 2018, with DFAT providing consular support over months or years.</p>
      <p>Australians, who made 11 million overseas trips in 2018/19 – up by a fifth in the past five years – asked for help in 13,715 cases, for issues ranging from theft to hospitalisation to death.</p>
      <p>The Sri Lanka bombings and Christchurch mosque attacks resulted in an overall increase in cases because the department was called on to help track loved ones.</p>
      <p>Excluding such “crisis” cases, the department said total requests for help were down on previous years, suggesting Australians were better prepared for overseas travel risks.</p>
