      <p>A reminder from the OPP to familiarize yourself with a romance and dating scam, after someone was bilked for around $300-thousand dollars.</p>
      <p>Norfolk County OPP were alerted to the issue last Thursday by a senior, claiming they'd established an online relationship with someone after meeting on a dating site.</p>
      <p>Through the conversations, OPP say several emails were exchanged involving the suspect's history and employment status, and a request for money was made, claiming several emergencies came up and the money was needed.</p>
      <p>The money was sent between July and November of this year.</p>
      <p>"Single or recently unattached people - often females - are among the growing number of vulnerable population to be victimized by criminals through fraudulent means," OPP state in a release, "Usually this occurs through contact online via e-mail blasts, social media (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.) or singles and dating-related 'meet' websites."</p>
      <p>They say knowledge is power, and advise you to not give out personal information over the phone, the internet or through social media or dating sites.</p>
      <p>OPP add to always get independent advice from either family members, a trusted friend or advisor before doing anything involving cash, personal information, time or a commitment.</p>
