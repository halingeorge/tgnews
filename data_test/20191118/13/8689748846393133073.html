      <p>Africa’s most decorated rapper, Sarkodie has demystified the reason behind the release of his songs on his Black Love album as singles instead of dropping the whole album at once.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Okay Africa, the rap King said  dropping the album in accordance with fans expectations is not a good idea commercially as people tend to forget about albums quickly.</p>
      <p>Sarkodie said he’s releasing the songs as singles in order to leave a lasting impression on the fans.</p>
      <p>He said:</p>
      <p>
        <b>“I have two versions of Black Love. The version I’m dropping now basically is just about love amongst black people and it’s 90 or 80 percent based on relationships, it’s more of love songs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you look at the records I’ve released so far, the first one being “Can’t Let You Go,” that was my wedding video featuring King Promise.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Right after that I did “Lucky” featuring Rudeboy from Nigeria. And then I did “Do You” featuring Mr Eazi, “Saara” featuring Efya and now “Party &amp; Bullshit.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>All the songs are just about love amongst black people and bringing that connection. And then there is one that has the type of message that was in the cypher and is more directly about black people and black power.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The only thing I’m doing is that I haven’t dropped a date yet or the track list, but it’s going to be any moment from now. It’s going to drop as a surprise. That’s what I have for the fans.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I really wanted them to focus on the singles and pushing more, because what I realized was if you put out a whole project, sometimes they miss the records if it’s too much. I wanted them to have time to enjoy at least four or five songs and then everything drops.”</b>
