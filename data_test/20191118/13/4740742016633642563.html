      <h1>Why Bromley's plastic pitch will dramatically impact Bristol Rovers' starting lineup for their FA Cup replay</h1>
      <h2>The Gas are likely to be without a number of key names for the first round tie</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:06:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Graham Coughlan admits he will have to listen to his medical staff as the conditions <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers</a> are set to encounter at Bromley's Hayes Lane present too much of an injury risk for some of his star men.</p>
      <p>Rovers take on the National League side on Tuesday night on a 3G pitch which presents its own unique challenge in terms of the bounce and speed in which a football travels on the turf.</p>
      <p>But more apparent will be the affect it has on muscles and tendons that aren't quite fully healed, with the extra stress leaving a possibility of aggravating or further damaging previous injuries.</p>
      <p>As a result, the Gas are likely to be without top scorer <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-verdict-jonson-clarke-3536043">Jonson Clarke-Harris</a>, captain Ollie Clarke, left wing-back Tareiq Holmes-Dennis and centre-back Tom Davies for the trip to south London which is being broadcast on BT Sport.</p>
      <p>Clarke-Harris only returned from a calf strain just over a week ago, in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bristol-rovers-bromley-bush-live-3521229">the 1-1 draw between the sides</a> at the Mem, Clarke has suffered a nagging hamstring strain for the last two months, Holmes-Dennis made his first steps back into action against Swindon in the EFL Trophy last Wednesday, while Davies is still recovering from a knee problem.</p>
      <p>When asked if the pitch will impact his selection, Coughlan said: "It will have to because there are one or two players who can't play on it for medical and personal reasons.</p>

      <p>"There are one or two who physically can't play on it, one or two returning from injury and one or two that maybe have some long-standing injuries that you could maybe flare up joints and tendons.</p>
      <p>"There was a detailed sit-down meeting with players and medical staff.</p>
      <p>"I've got to look at the long-term outlook. Because if we were to a put a player out, where there is a red flag, where there is a risk, he goes out long term, the player will come for me, the club will come for me and the supporters will come for me for making a daft decision.</p>
      <p>"I have to go with the experts, the medical department and the player."</p>
      <p>Rovers have altered their pre-match preparation to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/graham-coughlan-hoping-bromleys-plastic-3537659">accomodate the unusual conditions</a>.</p>
      <p>Training over the last few days has been switched to the evenings to replicate the dew that will be on the turf and Coughlan has also experimented by playing on different types of artifical surfaces across the city to ensure that when his players take to the turf, it doesn't come as a huge culture shock.</p>
      <p>The Dubliner is demanding a shift in attitude and temperament from his players after they were soundly out-played in the original tie at the Mem a week ago last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Despite playing poorly, Rovers took the lead through Luke Leahy but were unable to hold onto that advantage, even playing the final stages of the match against 10 men after Bromley had exhausted all their substitutions.</p>

      <p>In particular, Rovers must be wise to Bromley's set-piece approach from corners and long throw-ins which, in the claustrophobic confines of their modest Hayes Lane ground, could create an intimidating environment.</p>
      <p>"Whatever I have, the 18-20 boys will be up for it and be ready for it and irrespective of what team and system we adopt, we will hope to give a better account of ourselves second time around," Coughlan, who celebrated his 45th birthday on Monday, added.</p>
      <p>"Bromley are a set-piece team and they got another three goals this weekend, not directly, but from set-pieces.</p>
      <p>"That's something we'll have to prepare for, something we'll have to combat. They're a big, strong team, we know that - they will play off the long throw and long balls into the box, so they will put us under pressure.</p>
      <p>"We need to impose our game, we need to get a hold of the ball and move it around a lot quicker, a lot sharper and a lot better than we did when we played here.</p>
      <p>"If you go into games like this and you're on the back foot, they'll come after you. We'll need to be on the front foot and meet that challenge head on.</p>
      <p>"It's a good challenge and I'm looking forward to seeing how our players adapt to the circumstances and how we apply ourselves."</p>
