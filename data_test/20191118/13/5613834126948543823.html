      <h1>Google Stadia Adds New Titles Ahead of Launch Tomorrow, Including ‘RAGE 2’ And ‘Wolfenstein Youngblood’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:10:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Those Google Stadia adopters will have a little more meat to chew on when the <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3593695/google-stadia-launch-lineup-revealed-includes-mortal-kombat-11-red-dead-redemption-2-samurai-shodown/">service launches tomorrow</a>. Google has unexpectedly announced that the platform will be launching with an additional 10 games, bringing up its total number of launch games to 22.</p>
      <p>A couple of those games — <b><i>Wolfenstein Youngblood</i></b> and <b><i>RAGE 2</i></b> — were originally scheduled to be released on the platform later this year. And while it’s all well and good that Google has stepped up to address the complaint that the service was lacking launch titles, apart from the service-exclusive <b><i>GYLT</i></b>, all of the games on the service have been out for a while.</p>
      <p>Other genre titles expected to join Stadia next year include the much-anticipated <b><i>DOOM Eternal</i></b> and <b><i>Cyberpunk 2077</i></b>.</p>
