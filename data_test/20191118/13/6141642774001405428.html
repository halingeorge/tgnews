      <p>Putting astronauts into a state of suspended animation could make it easier to reach other planets, the European Space Agency said.</p>
      <p>The agency said its researchers examined how hibernation would affect the design of a crewed mission to Mars and concluded that it could help to significantly shrink the size of spacecraft.</p>
      <p>While slowing down humans’ metabolic rate similarly to the way animals hibernate is not possible yet, research team head Jennifer Ngo-Anh said the idea “is actually not so crazy”.</p>

      <p>Challenges include designing the spacecraft to operate largely autonomously while the crew, padded with extra body fat in advance of their trip, sleep through much of the 180-day cruise to Mars.</p>
