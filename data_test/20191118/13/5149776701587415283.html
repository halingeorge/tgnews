      <h1>Breastfeeding mum told to leave speed awareness course after bringing six-week old baby</h1>
      <h2>DriveTech state in their terms and conditions that children under 16 are not permitted in the class room</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:29:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:29</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>A mum-of-two has spoken of her 'distress' after being told she had to leave a speed awareness course when she brought along her six-week-old baby.</p>
      <p>Sarah Oakes, of Ruddington, had taken her newborn baby son to a course in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/beeston">Beeston </a>but was told children under 16 were not permitted.</p>
      <p>After explaining she was breastfeeding she was told she would need someone to sit with the baby outside the room, and could leave the course to breastfeed when necessary.</p>
      <p>As a result of not having someone available to help her, Mrs Oakes had to leave without participating.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old attended the course on Friday, November 15, after she was caught <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-and-travel">driving</a> 36mph in a 30mph zone in June this year.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, which she described as "quite distressing", she hopes DriveTech, the organisation responsible for he speed awareness course, will consider changing their policy.</p>
      <p>"Drive Tech said they support breastfeeding by allowing me to leave for feeds outside, but it's just not reasonable," Mrs Oakes said.</p>
      <p>"Feeds can be up to an hour, which means I would miss at least half the course, or have to stay an extra two hours to catch up.</p>
      <p>"It's impractical to expect mothers to have someone to support you or who can take leave from work.</p>
      <p>"I feel it is actively discriminating against breastfeeding which is actually unlawful. "</p>

      <p>DriveTech state in their terms and conditions that specific requirements, which includes breast feeding, need to be mentioned at the time of booking.</p>
      <p>Rooms can be provided for mums to breastfeed provided a second person is able to attend to look after the baby between feeds.</p>
      <p>Mrs Oakes added: "I totally understand the need to not disturb others but at six weeks, baby is just sleeping and feeding - if they were distressed, it would take five minutes outside to calm them.</p>
      <p>"I am either going to have to rebook the course, or take the points and fine," she said.</p>
      <p>"I'd hope DriveTech could offer more realistic options - allow breastfeeding mums the option to delay or offer an online course.</p>
      <p>"This is a nationally-run course which must be affecting a lot of other women in the same position."</p>
      <p>Mrs Oakes and husband Peter Howsen, 38, had paid £50 to have childcare for their four-year-old and then paid £100 for the course, in place of taking three penalty points and a £100 fine.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the incident, Mr Howsen said: "There is legislation out there to help women who are breastfeeding for this reason.</p>
      <p>"I think it's totally fair to presume a newborn would be allowed, especially at this vulnerable and emotional time it places an extra burden on mothers."</p>
      <p>Desmond Morrison, a director at DriveTech, said courses are offered three times a day, seven days a week to allow every opportunity to take the course.</p>
      <p>He added: "We deal with all types of diverse requests to ensure people are facilitated to take a course.</p>
      <p>"Around 30,000 people take the course every month with DriveTech across the UK, which will include hundreds of breastfeeding mothers.</p>
      <p>"The guidelines for the course is developed through 43 police forces and the course is part of a prosecution process."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for DriveTech added: “We are sorry if any distress was caused to the mother in this case.</p>
      <p>“We, and all other suppliers, must adhere to the guidelines laid down by NDORs (National Driver Offender Re-training scheme).</p>
      <p>"As such our stance regarding the provision of service for breast feeding mothers is laid out for us.</p>
      <p>“She would have been very welcome for a friend or family member to care for the baby in another room while the course took place and indeed, would have been able to take a break to attend to the baby.”</p>
