      <h1>Triumph Reunite for Three-Song Set</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:48:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/triumph/">Triumph</a> reunited for a three-song set in Toronto over the weekend. The performance was recorded for an upcoming documentary about the band.</p>
      <p>It was the first time Rik Emmet, Mike Levine and Gil Moore performed together in 11 years, and the first time they played as a power trio in 31 years. Around 300 fans were present for the show, which featured the classic songs “When the Lights Go Down,” “Lay It on the Line” and “Magic Power.” The filming took place in drummer Moore’s Metalworks studio complex; the results will be seen in the Banger Films production <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/triumph-documentary/"><i>Triumph: Lay It on the Line</i></a>, set for release next year.</p>
      <p>���Mike, Rik and I are thrilled to revisit Triumph’s history and especially to express our gratitude to our amazing fans," Moore said in a statement when the movie was announced. "We are excited to be working with Banger Films, and this documentary is our way of reaching out to all those people who have touched us along the journey to say thanks."</p>
      <p>Last year, he told <i>Ouch, You’re on My Hair</i> (via <a href="https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/legendary-canadian-rockers-triumph-reunite-for-three-song-performance-in-toronto/">Blabbermouth</a>) that the movie “talks a lot about the Us Festival, it talks about San Antonio, it talks about the issues, later on in our career, with the record label. It talks about all that stuff.”</p>
      <p>Moore noted that Triumph have received large-scale offers to reunite, but he wasn’t sure it would ever happen because of his commitments to Metalworks, which now employs around 100 staff members.</p>
      <p>“I'm tied down in a good way," he explained. "When I say 'tied down,' I'm doing what I love. I love Triumph. I'm not gonna say that we won't play again. It kind of tears at my heartstrings, to be honest with you. I wish I could get 36 hours in a day instead of 24 and keep my drum chops up and do that kind of thing.”</p>
      <p>The last official Triumph reunion took place at the Sweden Rock Festival in 2008. Moore and Levine <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rik-emmett-res-9-album/">appeared as special guests</a> on Emmett’s 2016 album<i> RES 9</i>.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>10. 'Edge of Excess' (1993)</h4>
      <p>Cosmetically speaking, ‘Edge of Excess’ checks most all of the musical boxes necessary to qualify as a bona fide Triumph LP, but fans generally agree that Gil Moore and Mike Levine should have never crossed the line of replacing the departed Rik Emmett with guitarist Phil X. The title track head-banged with a vengeance, but too many other tracks inhabited a melodic metal wasteland, wind-blown by formulaic lyrics that did them no favors.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>9. 'The Sport of Kings' (1986)</h4>
      <p>Feeling pressure from their record company to fit in with '80s fashions, Triumph reluctantly embraced faceless AOR on 1986's 'The Sport of Kings.' When they weren’t dousing songs like “Tears in the Rain” and “Hooked on You” under banks of synthesizers, the band was hardly recognizable to its fans on desperate radio-baiting experiments like "Don’t Love Anybody Else but Me," pleasing no one in the end.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>8. 'Surveillance' (1987)</h4>
      <p>Triumph attempted to backtrack into more familiar sonic hallmarks on 1987’s 'Surveillance,' but syrupy synths still overwhelmed both the anthemic rockers (“Never Say never,” “Carry on the Flame”) and vaguely progressive remnants (“Headed for Nowhere”). In sum, the band members' bodies were willing, but their hearts just weren’t up for the challenge of survival anymore, determining ‘Surveillance’ as being too little, too late.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>7. 'Thunder Seven' (1984)</h4>
      <p>Triumph hung onto their '70s values and aesthetic longer than most, but they finally started giving in to '80s recording conventions on 1984's transitional 'Thunder Seven.' For proof, look no further than side one’s unnaturally bright-sounding (but undeniably hooky) “Follow Your Heart” and the hair metal of “Rock Out, Roll On”). Yes, side two tried to compensate with a semi-conceptual song suite, and this had its moments, but not enough to disguise the band’s rate of decline.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>6. 'Progressions of Power' (1980)</h4>
      <p>The guys in Triumph were in too much of a rush to capitalize on the breakout success of 'Just a Game' and wound up taking a step back on the solid and competent, but very uneven, ‘Progressions of Power.’ Among the highlights, “I Live for the Weekend” and “Tear the Roof Off” brought white-knuckled excitement, and “I Can Survive” another sing-along chorus, but too many other songs just plodded along aimlessly (“In the Night,” “Nature’s Child,” etc.), putting Triumph’s career gearbox in “park,” for the time being.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>5. 'Triumph' (1976)</h4>
      <p>One of Triumph's most distinct records, this eponymous, Canada-only release kicks off with a Kiss-worthy party song in "24 Hours a Day" before settling down to more recognizable Triumph ingredients, including semi-prog excursions ("Blinding Light Show/Moonchild") and bluesy hard rockers ("Don't Take My Life," "Be My Lover"). But the most interesting distinction about ‘Triumph’ (later reissued as ‘In the Beginning’) is the growl in Rik Emmett’s typically sweet falsetto (see "Let Me Get Next to You"). And "Street Fighter" may be Triumph’s heaviest song ever.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2016/09/Never-Surrender.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>4. 'Never Surrender' (1983)</h4>
      <p>'Never Surrender' was a rather calculated effort by Triumph to recapture all of their most successful musical traits onto a single album. But most fans could identify that this meticulous song construction came at the expense of spontaneous excitement. But even the best songs -- like “All the Way,” “A World of Fantasy” and the title cut -- weren’t as fresh as comparable offerings from earlier albums.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>3. 'Rock &amp; Roll Machine' (1977)</h4>
      <p>The U.S. version of 'Rock &amp; Roll Machine' actually combined the best songs from Triumph's first two Canadian LPs (and the U.S. version would probably land higher in our list of Triumph Albums Ranked Worst to Best). Still, the original track listing has no weak links and is an essential record thanks to the ferocious title track, tough-nut "Takes Time," melodious "Bringing It on Home" and the ELP-inspired prog audacity of the 10-minute "The City" suite. Plus, there's a great cover of Joe Walsh’s “Rocky Mountain Way.”</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>2. 'Just a Game' (1979)</h4>
      <p>Probably the archetypal Triumph LP, 'Just a Game' crystallized the band's dual-threat approach as “proggies who rock real hard” on eclectic cuts like the testosterone-simple "American Girls," the grinding blues of "Young Enough to Cry" and the majestic (even philosophic!) title track. Even better, both the fist-pumping and irresistible "Lay It on the Line" and acoustic guitar-laced "Hold On" became hits, grazing the Top 40 and helping to push ‘Just a Game’ beyond the platinum sales mark for the first in Triumph’s career.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>1. 'Allied Forces' (1981)</h4>
      <p>Triumph's most cohesive album was also their most collaborative, with all three members focused on rebounding from the minor misstep of ‘Progressions of Power’ to recover their building career momentum. ‘Allied Forces’ surges ahead with the title track's take-no-prisoners assault, the heroic bombast of "Fight the Good Fight" and a tribute to music appreciation for the ages in the rousing "Magic Power." Rounding out the set, sturdy rockers like "Fool for Your Love," "Ordinary Man" and "Say Goodbye" helped make ‘Allied Forces’ Triumph’s greatest (sorry) triumph.</p>
