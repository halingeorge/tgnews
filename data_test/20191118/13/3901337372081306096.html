      <p>Ronaldo took his international tally to 99 goals during Portugal's 2-0 win over Luxembourg on the weekend, and helped his nation qualify for the 2020 UEFA European Championship.</p>
      <p>Despite the result, though, the Juventus star was unhappy with the quality of Luxembourg's pitch, which he compared to a potato field.</p>

      <p>"We had two games (during this international break) we had to win," Ronaldo said, as reported by <i>Channel News Asia.  </i></p>
      <p>“I am very happy that we won and qualified for my fifth European Championships. It's difficult to play on these types of fields, a potato field. I don't know how it's possible for teams at this level to play on fields of this quality.</p>
      <p>"The performance wasn't beautiful, but we did our job. It was the pitch we had to play, and we won 2-0, which was our priority."</p>
