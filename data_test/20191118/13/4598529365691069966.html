      <p>President Donald Trump reversed course on a ban of most flavored e-cigarettes due to concerns that he’d anger his supporters and eliminate related jobs just before his reelection.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-pulls-back-from-flavored-vaping-ban/2019/11/17/30853ece-07ae-11ea-924a-28d87132c7ec_story.html">According to the Washington Post,</a> he let the ban die despite pressure from first lady Melania Trump and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump. The two pushed the issue after a rash of mysterious deaths linked to vaping.</p>
      <p>“We can’t have our kids be so affected,” Trump said a couple of months ago at a policy announcement with his wife. “She’s got a son,” Trump added, referring to their shared son, Barron. “She feels very strongly about it.”</p>
      <p>Trump was shaken by a pervasive social media campaign called #IVapeIVote and protesters at his rally. Campaign manager Brad Parscale reportedly told him that he could risk losing voters in the battleground states if he went through with the ban.</p>
