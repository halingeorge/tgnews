      <p>“We await formal identification of the deceased and, of course, will fully assist the police and emergency services in their investigation.”</p>

      <p>Officers raced to the bridge in the north of the city at around 7.40am where a man was found dead.</p>
      <p>And a police probe has been launched after a man's <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4966555/aberdeenshire-turriff-body-found-burn-police/">body was found at an Aberdeenshire burn.</a></p>
      <p> </p>
