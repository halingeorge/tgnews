      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Sony WH-XB900N wireless headphones</a> are back on sale today in Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day, where you can get them for just $128. That is good for $120 off its regular price â€“ nearly 50-percent off.</p>
      <p>These headphones are pretty underrated, because when it comes to premium headphones, everyone looks at Sony's WH-1000XM3, which are some really good headphones. But the WH-XB900N are also really good. And at about $100 less (normally) than the WH-1000XM3, they are worth looking at. Now that they are nearly a third of the price of those headphones, these are the ones to buy.</p>
      <p>The WH-XB900N are a really great pair of headphones. As you can likely tell by the name, these are part of the Extra Bass lineup. So you're going to get a ton of bass out of these headphones. That's great for those that like listening to bass-heavy music. And it is also adjustable using the Sony app, so if it's too much bass for you, then you can tone it down a bit.</p>

      <p>Sound quality here is what you'd expect, and it's really good. After all, Sony is also a music label, so it's going to want its music to sound better on its own headphones. The mids and highs are crisp, while the bass is really low and thumping.</p>
      <p>Battery life on the WH-XB900N is really good. We're looking at 30 hours on a single charge.</p>
      <p>There is also noise cancellation available on the WH-XB900N. But where this differs from the WH-1000XM3 is the Ambient Sound, it's not here. So you're just getting noise cancellation, and that's going to be plenty for most people. You're still getting Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant support through these as well.</p>
