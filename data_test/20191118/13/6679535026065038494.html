      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who met Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday evening for over 45 minutes, claimed that he didn’t talk about government formation in Maharashtra but only briefed the Congress president about the situation there.</p>
      <p>“There was no talk of government formation in our meeting. This meeting was all about discussing Congress and NCP,” Mr. Pawar told reporters, when asked if Ms. Gandhi was opposed to a coalition government with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>“We discussed in detail about Maharashtra’s political situation. I briefed her on it. Mr. A.K. Antony was also there. We will keep an eye on the situation. Some senior leaders of both Congress and NCP will meet and discuss further and get back to us,” he added.</p>
      <p>His meeting with Ms Gandhi's 10, Janpath residence comes days after he reportedly negotiated with the Shiv Sena leadership over government formation in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>Last week, the NCP chief had had said a government will soon be in place in Maharashtra and will last a term of full five years.</p>
      <p>However, after his meeting with the Congress president, Mr Pawar displayed no sense of hurry and said they still have to consult a few more pre-poll allies like Samajwadi Party and the Swambhimani Shetkari Sangathan headed by Raju Shetti.</p>
      <p>“We want to talk to all parties who supported us.We did not talk about the Shiv Sena,” the NCP chief and but refused to categorically rule out the possibility of a government with the Sena.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question on the possibility of NCP providing outside support to a BJP-led government in the State, Mr Pawar said “majority of the seats won by the NCP was against the BJP”.</p>
      <p>The NCP chief’s Monday meeting also comes amidst reports that Shiv Sena Uddhav Thackeray had postponed his plan to visit Ayodha (post the Supreme verdict) after reported reservation by the Congress-NCP alliance.</p>
      <p>"Sharad Pawar met the Congress President today and briefed her on the situation in Maharashtra. It was decided that in a day or two, representatives from NCP and Congress will meet in Delhi to discuss the way forward," Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>On November 12, Maharashtra was put under President's Rule after no party or alliance could provide numbers to back their claim. Though the Sena had met the Governor and claimed ‘in-princple’ support from the Congress-NCP alliance, they could not produce any formal letter as none was given to them.</p>
      <p>The issue of supporting the Sena had divided the Congress: while the Maharashtra leaders wanted to be part of a Sena-led government, several national leaders, especially those from Kerala like Mr Antony and K Cvenugopal, are opposed to it.</p>
