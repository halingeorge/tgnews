      <p>An elephant named after Osama bin Laden has died in captivity after going on a wild stampede that killed five people.</p>
      <p>The animal died yesterday at the Orang National Park in Assam, India, where officials were planning to teach it to patrol wildlife parks and sanctuaries.</p>
      <p>The elephant killed five people through the Goalpara district in October.</p>
      <p>It had been tracked for days by forestry officers and was tranquilised last week.</p>
      <p>"The animal was behaving as normal. It was, however, kept with its legs tied so that it couldn't escape," a park ranger, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP.</p>

      <p>The keeper reported the animal dead at roughly 5am on Sunday, he said.</p>
      <p>A senior official said the state government had sent a team of veterinarians to carry out an autopsy.</p>
      <p>At the moment, the cause of death remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Before the elephant's death, the forestry department planned to tame it using "kraak", a regime condemned by wildlife conservationists as torture, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191117-rogue-elephant-dies-in-captivity-after-killing-villagers">France24</a> reports.</p>

      <p>The animal was unsuitable for captivity because it was believed to be around 35 years old, conservationists said.</p>
      <p>Over 2,300 people were killed by elephants in India in the last five years, according to <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/elephants-killed-over-2300-people-in-last-five-years-environment-ministry/article28208456.ece">The Hindu</a> .</p>
      <p>The beasts frequently migrate into Goalpara, resulting in high numbers of fatal encounters with humans because of rampant deforestation.</p>
