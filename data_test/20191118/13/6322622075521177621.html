      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): Yinson Holdings Bhd is raising US$800 million through the refinancing of its floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel John Agyekum Kufuor, which is currently operating offshore Ghana.</p>
      <p>“The refinancing allows Yinson to enjoy lower interest rates whilst freeing up capital to be invested in future projects,” the integrated offshore production and support services provider said in a statement.</p>
      <p>A total of 13 banks participated in the refinancing, namely CIMB Bank Bhd, Clifford Capital Pte Ltd, Crédit Industriel et Commercial, DBS Bank Ltd, Korea Development Bank, Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, MUFG Bank Ltd, Natixis, Singapore Branch, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd, Societe Generale, London Branch, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Ltd and United Overseas Bank Ltd.</p>
      <p>Yinson said the vessel is chartered to Eni Ghana Exploration &amp; Production Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eni S.p.A., an Italian multinational energy company that has a long-term credit rating of A- by Fitch.</p>
      <p>Yinson group chief strategy officer Daniel Bong said the deal was oversubscribed by over 45%.</p>
      <p>"This deal is an innovative capital velocity exercise that we believe will further improve the returns of the project.”</p>
      <p>“The fact that this deal is oversubscribed, speaks of the confidence that the banking market has in Yinson, to maintain high uptime and the quality of our asset for the next 12 years," he said.</p>
      <p>Yinson’s shares closed three sen or 0.45% at RM6.64 today, valuing the company at RM7.18 billion. Over the past year, the counter has risen by some 59% from RM4.19.</p>
