      <p>The former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/one-direction">One Direction</a> member, who left the huge boyband in 2015 to pursue a solo career, released his <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/zayn-malik-icarus-falls-review">second album ‘Icarus Falls</a><i>‘ </i>last year. It followed on from his <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-zayn-malik-0-16432">2016 debut ‘Mind Of Mine</a>‘.</p>
      <p>Last week, Malik teased the new single after sharing a picture of its upcoming artwork. In the accompanying caption, Zayn wrote simply the single’s title in all-capitals.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the new song, R3HAB said: “I was working on the ‘Flames’ song for quite some time together with Jungleboi when we got the call from Zayn. The result is absolutely epic. I couldn’t be more proud of the result and look forward to sharing this amazing tune with the world.”</p>
      <p>At the beginning of 2019, Zayn spoke of how he “cannot wait to get on stage” and that he was “feeling ready” to head back out on the road. The singer is yet to announce details of his live return.</p>
