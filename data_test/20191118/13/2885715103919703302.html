      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:07:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The per capita consumption of stainless steel in India has reached 2.5 kg-mark, industry body ISSDA said on Monday.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the per capita consumption of steel was 1.2 kg and in 2019 the figure stands at 2.5 kg, registering a rise of over 100 per cent during the period, Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Growth rate of stainless steel demand in India is to the tune of 6-7 per cent CAGR, which is also among the highest in the world, as stainless steel demand is directly linked to economic growth. Stainless steel not only has a low life cycle cost, but also improves overall quality of life,” the statement quoted Minister of State for Steel Faggan Singh Kulaste as saying.</p>
      <p>ISSDA President K K Pahuja said the Association has been promoting new stainless steel applications across the spectrum of industries since its inception. India is now the fastest growing market for stainless steel.</p>
      <p>With the achievement of 2.5 kg per capita consumption level, he said, India has reached an inflexion point and entered the league of countries where stainless-steel consumption is recorded on the higher side.</p>
      <p>ISSDA further said the local stainless-steel market is the fastest growing market in the world with a CAGR of 8-9 per cent and “(as a result of) growing trade protectionist sentiment across the globe, the growing Indian market has become an easy target for dumping of the surplus production from <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-is-asean-5028044/">ASEAN</a> producers.”</p>
      <p>Low entry barriers for goods due to operational FTAs with ASEAN, Japan and Korea distort the demand-supply dynamic and adversely impact the domestic manufacturers, it said.</p>
      <p>“Almost half of the industries in the MSME sector have been particularly hit by cheaper imports. Further, a higher input cost on account of import duty on key raw materials, like stainless steel scrap and Ferro nickel, makes Indian product less competitive than its global peers.</p>
      <p>“ISSDA has flagged these issues with the government and is working to remove the growth hurdles for domestic industry,” it said.</p>
