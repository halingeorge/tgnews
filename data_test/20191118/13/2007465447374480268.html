      <h1>2020 Mitsubishi Mirage, G4: This is it</h1>
      <h2>2020 Mitsubishi Mirage and Mirage G4 debut. PH launch soon?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:23:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/anton-andres.html" target="_blank">Anton Andres</a></address>
      <p>First, it was a spy shot, then, it was a teaser. Now, Mitsubishi Motors has officially revealed the 2020 Mirage and its sedan counterpart, the G4, which is dubbed the Attrage in Thailand. While we have a general idea of what it looks like, it's nice to see official photos, as well as its specs.</p>

      <p>As mentioned before, the Mirage and the G4 now have what's called the 'Dynamic Shield' design language. It borrows some elements from models such as the Eclipse Cross (which, sadly, we don't get here), Strada, Montero Sport, and Xpander. Both sedan and hatch get much longer headlights, adapting a wraparound design instead of the old 'bug-eye' lenses. The grill, on the other hand, is clearly lifted from the current model range with its slats and chrome band that runs from the headlight to the bumper's apron. To accommodate the new look, even the hood and fenders have been redesign as part of the 2020 update.</p>

      <p>Yes, it's an update as it's not an all-new model. It still rides on the same platform which has been in use since 2012 (2013 for G4 sedan). Doors and quarter panels are the same as before, but the rear fascia has been freshened up. The taillights have redesigned clusters sporting new patterns for both sedan and hatchback. Bumpers on both models have been tweaked too, integrating larger reflectors and faux diffusers. Trunk lid and tailgate still have the same look.</p>

      <p>The interior has been largely carried over. It does gain automatic climate control in select variants, and new seat patterns are now available. Other than that, the dash design, door panels, and air-conditioning vents should look familiar to most. The touchscreen audio system now comes with Apple CarPlay, but will vary from country to country.</p>

      <p>Also carried over is the 1.2-liter, three-cylinder engine that's been in service for over five years now. Power is retained at 78 PS and 100 Nm of torque with shifting done via a five-speed manual or continuously variable transmission. Stability control is available.</p>

      <p>With the Mirage and Attrage (Mirage G4) now out in Thailand, it's only a matter of time before Mitsubishi Motors Philippines will roll out the 2020 edition sooner than later. Who knows, maybe they're even building it now at the Santa Rosa, Laguna plant already.</p>
