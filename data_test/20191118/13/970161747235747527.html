        <b>Gerwyn Price is hoping that his battles with PDC crowds are at an end after retaining his Grand Slam of Darts title in some style on Sunday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was something especially fulfilling for Price to win the tournament for a second time, but in vastly contrasting circumstances to his triumph 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>Price beat Gary Anderson 16-13 to win the 2018 event, but that is where many of his quarrels with crowds have stemmed from, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/23/gerwyn-price-hit-huge-fine-dra-grand-slam-darts-antics-8380734/">being find for the gamesmanship he undertook in that contest.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/gerwyn-price-sends-emotional-message-supporters-painful-world-grand-prix-exit-10887220/">The Iceman has been through tough times</a> with fans getting on his back ever since, making life difficult for him on the oche as he plays to loud boos and whistles.</p>
      <p>The new world number three has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/gerwyn-price-reflects-decent-weekend-european-championship-retirement-threat-11006317/">threatened retirement</a> and called for the PDC to step in over the abuse, which he has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/19/gerwyn-price-calls-pdc-step-crowd-abuse-draws-racism-football-comparison-10944027/">likened to racism in football</a>.</p>

      <p>However, it might just be a thing of the past after his second Wolverhampton success, as his 16-6 battering of Peter Wright on Sunday was largely met with cheers of support.</p>
      <p>‘All week the crowd’s been fantastic, I’ve had a few boos but nothing like it’s been all year,’ Price told <a href="https://www.live-darts.com/">Live Darts.</a></p>
      <p>‘To win the tournament, lift the trophy and have the cheers that I did, I appreciate it, I really do.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes it puts you under a bit more pressure. I’m not used to it, but it is nice.’</p>

      <p>The Welshman picked up the giant top prize of £125,000 for his demolition of Snakebite, in which he averaged an enormous 107.86.</p>
      <p>Not only was he pleased to not have to deal with boos, but went as far as to say the support of the crowd helped him get hold of the trophy for a second time.</p>
      <p>‘They truly have got behind me this weekend and I appreciate it, they pushed me on to win this.</p>
      <p>‘I’m chuffed to bits to get hold of this again and finally get the crowd to cheer.’</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old climbs to a career high of number three in the world less than six years after he first turned professional in January 2014.</p>

      <p>Not only did he wallop Wright in the final on Sunday, but also downed the world number one, Michael van Gerwen, in the semis, laying down a significant marker for the upcoming World Championship.</p>
      <p>Price is now the second favourite behind MVG for the biggest prize in the sport and is in bullish mood ahead of his return to the Alexandra Palace and a possible meeting with Van Gerwen after beating him for the first time in his career.</p>
      <p>‘The last three or four times I’ve played him I’ve out-played him and bombed opportunities,’ Price continued.</p>
      <p>‘I still slipped up one or two opportunities but I’m over the moon to beat him and get the monkey off my back.</p>
      <p>‘He said a few things after the last time I played him. But he’s just scared of me now, I’m here to have him.’</p>
      <p>The Iceman will be battling it out for one more trophy before the World Championship as he heads to Minehead for the Players Championship Finals this weekend, with another £100,000 on offer for the winner.</p>
      <p>He goes in as the number one seed after a superb year in floor events and will be hoping to gain yet more momentum ahead of the all-important trip to north London in December.</p>
