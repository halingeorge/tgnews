      <p>The juxtaposition of the two foreign interference articles in The Age on Saturday could not have been more galling. The Morrison government's acceptance of China Mengniu's takeover of Bellamy's, even after allegations of market manipulation to lower the price, is in stark contrast to the refusal by Beijing to allow outspoken MPs Andrew Hastie and James Paterson into China for a study tour. The Chinese embassy, as is its habit, added insult by declaring that both men should "repent".</p>

      <p>It is not Australia that is actively interfering in other countries' affairs. I teach academic English to students entering into Australian universities, many of whom are Chinese. We have been asked by management not to discuss anything "controversial", such as Hong Kong, the plight of the Uighers, the militarisation of the South China Sea, etc. However, one word that I will be sure to teach this week is "hypocrisy".</p>
      <h4>Cody Savvidou, Northcote</h4>
      <h4>Money talks, censure walks</h4>
      <p>I doubt that China will care a fig for the condemnation that will follow the leaked reports of their treatment of their minority population. I expect there will be a lot of sabre rattling from some countries, but money talks louder and financial benefits with China will soon silence the screams of outrage.</p>

      <h4>Just a zero-tolerance control freak</h4>
      <p>Our politicians and media must not be intimidated by the Chinese Communist Party's tantrum diplomacy whenever it is criticised. This continued behaviour just reinforces the branding of the CCP as a zero-tolerance control freak rather than a mature government promoting itself and its nation as an endearing tolerant culture that can respond to criticism with compelling counter arguments.</p>
      <p>

      <h4>Are we willing to pay the price?</h4>
      <p>I am all for a robust stance on human rights within China and freedom for Australian politicians and press to express disdain for Chinese government policy. So far the cost has been denial of visas for two MPs who win kudos for their commentary. We may pay a much greater price in trade and relations and I hope our government and we, as a people, are willing to pay this price. I think it would be wise to count the cost now publicly and, if push comes to shove, identify values more important to us than economic worth. Our moral high ground is somewhat undermined by our government's attitude to other repressive regimes such as Saudi Arabia, to refugees who have arrived by boat and our repression of press freedom. But, sadly, more to the point, our commitment to values may have a price tag we are not prepared to pay and we will be forced by our venality to acquiesce to Chinese government wishes.</p>
      <p>

      <h4>There's a mixed message from Canberra</h4>
      <p>The Coalition government seemingly wants to have it both ways in their "on and off" relationship with China. As demonstrated by the mixed messaging approving the Chinese takeover of Bellamy's while sanctimoniously lecturing its lucrative trading partner about its poor human rights record.</p>
      <p>Where there is significant profit to be made (as in the sale of Bellamy's), the government appears only too happy to let a few things slide. Human rights a notable case in point.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Senator James Paterson's lament that the "Chinese government is picking and choosing who will be admitted" (into their country just like Australia picks and chooses) among Australia's elected representatives is farcical considering his government's mixed messaging on the subject of Australia-China relations.</p>
      <p>So, perhaps our representatives need to go back to the drawing board to unravel their cognitive dissonance (when it comes to China) and to consider our parlous human rights record (when it comes to our First Nation's Peoples and refugees). Just a suggestion.</p>

      <h3>FORUM</h3>
      <h4>Drop in the ocean</h4>
      <p>I concur with Ray Cas and Rodney Syme (Letters, 18/11). The comments of Senator Jordon Steele-John are mild to those I have uttered at the complete lack of response or planning of the present government when plenty of warning has been given by experts over the past decades. My daughter, who has been heavily involved in an anti-deforestation group, lives in a bushfire area and has been packed up for some time expecting the inevitable.</p>
      <p>And as the government makes so little effort apart from feigning empathy and promising money so little response has been demonstrated in other areas, eg, it has been said that in the media merely 5 per cent have alluded to climate change.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Beverley McIntyre, Camberwell</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Hearts and hats</h4>
      <p>Thank you Rodney Syme for eloquently explaining the justification for Jordon Steele-John's strong language. The Greens senator was speaking from his heart, while the government is speaking through its hat.</p>

      <h4>For a bit of quiet</h4>
      <p>As Gary Martin (Comment, 18/11) says introverts do not fear or dislike other people. Introverts' reluctance to interact with others often relates to the sheer tedium of engaging in pointless conversation and other conventions according to the rules established by extroverts.</p>
      <p>Introverts are misunderstood. What is taken to be shyness or unfriendliness is more often a wish that the extroverts would just shut up for a while.</p>

      <h4>Look closer to home</h4>
      <p>Andrew Hastie and James Paterson would have more credibility in their stance against China's human rights abuse if they first addressed the Morrison government's human rights abuse being conducted on Manus island and Nauru.</p>

      <h4>Tanks for nothing</h4>
      <p>Mark Biss (Letters, 18/11) is fortunate to have only chocolate pressed upon him at his local petrol station. Thanks to mine I now have enough toilet rolls to cater for a major dysentery outbreak and enough paper towels to cope with a serious oil tanker spill. I was driving home the other day with a new supply when my car ran out of petrol.</p>

      <h4>Booms and busts</h4>
      <p>Tony Walker's article "Boomers enjoy boom times" (18/11) typifies the strangely contradictory political-economic commentary we have seen since the May election. On the one hand, Walker provides impelling evidence that the present tax system, which is relentlessly enriching many baby boomers (and in some cases their descendants) to the disadvantage of most of the younger generation, is unfair and unsustainable. But then he dismisses the very policies needed to reform the system as "dysfunctional and overloaded election ambitions". He calls on "Boomers" to (voluntarily?) yield ground. Good luck with that. To effectively address the problem he and other commentators should encourage the ALP to hold strong on franking credits, negative gearing, capital gains tax and help it to cut through the "retiree tax" nonsense propagandised before the last election by the self-funded retiree/money manager/Palmer blitz/LNP bloc.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bill King, Camberwell</b>
      </p>
      <h4>A boomer I am not</h4>
      <p>I'm tired of being vilified in print for attributes I don't have (property, money, assets, golf etc.) experiences I never sought, and attitudes I never possessed, just because my age (67) makes me a "baby boomer" (Tony Walker, Comment, 18/11). It's an arbitrary category making stereotypical middle-class generalisations over an implausible age range. I don't have anything in common with people more than about three years older or younger. And of course, we had it so good: Vietnam War, Conscription, Oil Crisis etc.</p>

      <h4>How did we get here?</h4>
      <p>Nicole Hemmer ("Treating impeachment as a game", 18/11) accurately charts the downward spiral of American politics from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump. She paints a picture of a value-free "post-truth" world where law, facts and principles are lost in the media noise. Everybody is outraged about something and few have any capacity to work out what really matters. So Bill Clinton's dishonesty about his sexual behaviour at the time was considered serious, whereas now Trump's willingness to sacrifice an alliance and to distort the democratic process can be shrugged off. How did we come to this?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Patrice McCarthy, Bendigo</b>

      <h4>Primary lessons</h4>
      <p>The article "Men disappearing from classroom" (18/11) cited disturbing projections that, on current trends, there could be no male primary school teachers in all schools by 2067.</p>
      <p>Leaving aside the posited emotional immaturity of young Australian men as a causative factor, it may be necessary as a recruiting tool to increase dramatically the pay and status of all primary teachers: a variant on the usual "affirmative action" strategy. As the article points out, the absence of male teachers has the capacity to negatively impact upon "children's gender knowledge". Such a "role model" deficit should command government attention.</p>
      <p>At a time when Australian society is blighted by an epidemic of fractured relationships, the social need to lessen the gender disparity in our primary teaching cohort should be obvious.</p>

      <h4>Work required</h4>
      <p>With the economy flat and heading in the wrong direction for Christmas sales, it turns out the government really needs workers after all. Who would have thought? All its own work by these "good economic managers".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jeanne Hart, Maryborough</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Elders' wisdom</h4>
      <p>Tony Wright's piece ("Forests blaze, reason goes up in smoke", 16/11), about his family's passing on through the generations of the wisdom and knowledge learned from our traditional owners in relation to land management, wildfire and regeneration – and the despair he shares for how it is mismanaged today – mirrors my own experiences.</p>
      <p>Our traditional owners trod lightly on the earth. They didn't use chainsaws or earth-moving equipment to clear the land and degrade the soil structure and canopy cover that are essential in providing sun protection for the survival of forest ecosystems. They nurtured it and were rewarded by it.</p>
      <p>The fires across NSW and Queensland are not, as our leaders would have us believe, solely due to prolonged drought. With decade upon decade of deforestation within their native forests for timber supply and agricultural land clearing, vast areas in both states are now baking, and their water catchments have a depleted water yield.</p>
      <p>Once you factor in the mismanagement of the Darling River and the exacerbation of climate change, it is time for our political class to now seek out the wisdom of our elders.</p>

      <h4>Say a little prayer</h4>
      <p>What would Scott Morrison do if he woke up with a high fever and dozens of painful inflamed boils over large parts of his body. Think if all his doctor offered him were thoughts and prayers?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Peter Voice, Deep Lead</b>
      </p>
      <h4>It's everyone's fault</h4>
      <p>The recent ill-tempered exchanges between Greens and LNP politicians about climate change in the wake of the recent bushfires are the result of a lack of judgment of voters going back many election cycles. We can't blame any elected official for the fires. We, the voters, are the ones who put them there.</p>
      <p>At the last election, people knew that the Liberal and National parties' policies were anti-renewable energy and supportive of fossil fuel industries as opposed to emissions-free technology like wind and solar, yet we still rewarded this disregard for science and lack of foresight with our vote.</p>
      <p>Until voters take responsibility and put those candidates and parties who don't advocate for an emergency response to climate change last on our ballot papers, then we will forever be facing this perpetual blame game and still have no proper action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>And we will still wonder when this "perpetual drought" is going to break.</p>

      <h4>A debt owed</h4>
      <p>What makes so many Australians think that we owe our prosperity to no one but ourselves?</p>
      <p>In the broadest sense, Western prosperity has come on the backs of people of the Third World, a fact we seemingly ignore. And, too, the land we've waxed fat on we took from our Indigenous peoples.</p>
      <p>The very least we can do is to fulfil our signatory obligations to the United Nations convention on refugees, which we manifestly are not doing. Refugees that we have often helped to create in the first place by ill-advised adventures into their countries.</p>
      <p>We owe these people. Something PMs Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke recognised, and acted on.</p>
