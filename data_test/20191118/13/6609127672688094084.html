      <p>The 41-year-old was last seen visiting Morrisons supermarket in Dalmore Road shortly before 1.30pm.</p>
      <p>He bought food before leaving the shop on foot.</p>
      <p>Concerns were raised when he failed to turn up to his parents’ house for dinner that night.</p>
      <p>His disappearance came as temperatures dropped to -6C in parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Local Coastguard, RNLI and mountain rescue teams were helping the Police Scotland search effort and a body was pulled from River Averon in the town on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Mr MacKenzie's family has been informed but the body has yet to be formally identified.</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson said: "Around 4.30pm on Friday November 15 2019, the body of a man was recovered from the River Averon in Alness close to Braeface Park.</p>
      <p>"Although no formal identification has taken place, the family of Calum Mackenzie, who has been missing from Lanes for over a week, has been made aware.</p>
      <p>"A post-mortem examination will take place and enquiries are continuing."</p>
