      <p>Peter Salter <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/crime/2019/10/28/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-collision-was-just-yards-from-his-home/">died after being struck by a silver Mercedes</a> as he crossed Evans Street in Whitmore Reans, Wolverhampton, at around 10pm on October 16.</p>
      <p>An inquest was today told how Mr Salter, 63, died from traumatic head and neck injuries just yards away from the home he lived in with his wife.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Mercedes, which was heading towards the A449 Stafford Road, driver stopped and approached his body before getting back into the car to talk to a passenger, Black Country Coroner's Court was told.</p>
      <p>The passenger was then said to have got out of the vehicle before the driver left the scene.</p>
      <p>Mr Salter, a painter a decorator, was declared dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>A 48-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving has since been released and the investigation is continuing.</p>
      <p>Coroner's officer Stephen Binsley told the court on Monday: "Mr Slater was married to Mary and was a painter and decorator.</p>
      <p>"At 10.08pm he was crossing Evans Street near to number 77.</p>
      <p>"He was struck by a Mercedes heading in the direction of Stafford Road.</p>
      <p>"There is an investigation under way."</p>
      <p>No members of Mr Salter's family attended the inquest at Black Country Coroner's Court, but they previously described how he "will be sadly missed by all.”</p>
      <p>Area coroner Joanne Lees said she offered her condolences to his family, before adjourning the inquest until January 24 next year at 10.30am.</p>
      <p>In a statement released through police, Mr Salter's family said: "He had many friends in the area and was a very friendly person who always had time for a chat - he was well known in the local Asda by all the staff members from meeting his wife from work.</p>
      <p>"Pete also did a lot of charity work with his wife, including running the conservatory in West Park for over two years.</p>
      <p>"They then went on to work with the Alzheimer’s Society with whom he would have been doing an event this Saturday in the West Park.</p>
