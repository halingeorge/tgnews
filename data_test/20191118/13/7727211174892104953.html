      <p>Merseyrail passengers will soon be banned from smoking at all stations and platforms. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyrail">The rail company</a>  carries 110,000 passengers every weekday and operates one of the most used networks in the UK, with 600 trains running each day.</p>
      <p>The new smoking ban put in place by Merseyrail will be in action from December 1.</p>

      <p>Passengers travelling with Merseyrail will be issued with a warning if found to be smoking on any of the platforms, however those who continue may be fined from January 1next year.</p>
      <p>The change comes after a national Stoptober campaign and Merseyrail say it is part of their commitment to cleaner air and comfort of its passengers across the network. </p>
      <p>Vaping and E-cigerettes are also included in the ban; with Merseyrail staff and Byelaw Enforcement Officers actively requesting passengers to stop smoking on the platforms and other parts of the station.</p>
      <p>Andy Heath, Managing Director of Mersey rail, said: “The comfort of passengers on our network is absolutely paramount to us, so I am pleased to announce a smoking ban across all our stations and  platforms.</p>
      <p>“Those who wish to smoke will be able to do so in station car parks or off station property, however we  want all passengers to be able to use our trains and stations comfortably and without the risks of passive  smoking, such as lung cancer, asthma and pneumonia.”</p>
