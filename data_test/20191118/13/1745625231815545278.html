      <p>Over the weekend, <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/tlc">TLC</a>‘s legendary album, <i>CrazySexyCool</i>, turned 25-years-old. Their groundbreaking sophomore album was released through Sony Music in 1994 and became a worldwide success.</p>
      <p>Fans took to Twitter to celebrate the milestone and share what their favorite tracks are.</p>
      <p>“This album here was everything. ‘Red Light Special’ was my jam. I was six and after seeing the video I played over and over,” one user wrote.</p>
      <p>“I absolutely remember this album and trying to do the ‘Waterfalls’ dance. At the time, I’d never heard that type of storytelling in a song so popular,” another shared.</p>
      <p>“25th anniversary of TLC’s #CrazySexyCool this album was and still is FIRE,” a third account tweeted.</p>
      <p>“This was the very first album I purchased as a kid. I remember being so excited that I had saved enough money to go buy it!! Such a dope album Can’t believe it’s been 25 years,” a fourth user wrote.</p>
      <p>The album became one of 92 albums in the U.S. to be certified diamond, selling over 10 million copies in that country alone. <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/billboard-lists/7526410/diamond-certified-album-riaa-ranked"><i>Billboard</i></a> ranked the record as the seventh greatest album to go diamond, placing higher than Madonna, No Doubt, and Adele.</p>
      <p>The era enjoyed four hit singles — “Waterfalls,” “Creep,” “Diggin On You,” and “Red Light Special” — which are considered some of their signature songs. According to <a href="https://www.musicvf.com/TLC.art"><i>Music VF</i></a>, “Creep” became their first single to top the U.S. Hot 100 singles chart and “Waterfalls” became their second. <i>CrazySexyCool</i> peaked at No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart.</p>
