      <p>(CNN) - A man accidentally shot his brother while they were deer hunting in Michigan Saturday.</p>
      <p>The two men were hunting in Boston Township, about 130 miles northwest of Detroit, when they were looking for a deer that one brother had shot earlier, a release from the<a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2750102465021618&amp;id=589430314422188"> Ionia County Sheriff's Office said.</a></p>
      <p>Around 5:30 p.m. they had exhausted their search and were separated in a dense cornfield, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>The shooter believed he saw a deer moving through the corn and fired a shot from a muzzle-loading rifle, striking his brother, according to the sheriff's office.</p>
      <p>After calling 911, both brothers exited the field and met with first responders.</p>
      <p>The injured brother was flown to Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids in serious but stable condition, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>While the exact cause of the shooting hasn't been determined, both brothers have been fully cooperative with investigators, according to the sheriff's office.</p>
