      <p>Blond bombshell <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/lauren-drain/">Lauren Drain</a> has wowed fans yet again with another throwback post to Instagram, this time flaunting her killer body in a tiny white two-piece swimsuit, worn when she was still an official bikini competitor. In her caption, Lauren cheekily asked fans if she should enter the contests once more after her baby. Unsurprisingly, fans replied overwhelmingly in the affirmative.</p>
      <p>In the video, Lauren stood against a cream wall, offering a neutral background so that all eyes are on the former cardiac nurse. That said, most followers would argue that the blond beauty would command attention no matter the setting, considering her incredible figure.</p>
      <p>That figure was on full display in her skimpy white bikini. The top was a classic triangle cut, with its characteristic low neckline that showcased Lauren’s cleavage. The bikini top was decorated with a number of pretty accents at the top and on the straps, which appeared to be a combination of shells and beads.</p>
      <p>The bikini bottom matched the top, and the side straps also featured the same shell and beading combo. Lauren then completed the ensemble with a pair of strappy metallic high-heeled sandals that served to elongate her toned and tanned legs.</p>
      <p>Making sure that the focus was on her body, Lauren styled her locks straight and sleek, and wore almost no makeup, keeping what little she wore in a neutral palette. The white of the bikini highlighted her bronzed skin, possibly earned from sunny days in her home state of California.</p>
      <p>The clip started with a man in the background giving some encouragement to the stunning blonde as she began posing for pictures.</p>
      <p>“Okay, guys, check this out,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Someone’s getting ready,” he then added.</p>
      <p>All the while, Lauren continued angling her body to show off everything from her toned midriff to her perky posterior. She began by jutting out her hip and keeping her arm bent behind her head, and then mirrored the move on the opposite side.</p>
      <p>Lauren then turned sideways to show off more of her derriere, teasingly playing with her hair the entire time.</p>
      <p>The video ended with Lauren smiling as the camera zoomed in on the stunning fitness model.</p>

      <p>The post earned just shy of 15,000 likes, as well as around 200 glowing comments.</p>

      <p>“Yes you should,” one fan quickly replied to her caption query, adding several emoji like the fire and red heart.</p>
      <p>“Please compete,” echoed another, along with two pink hearts.</p>
      <p>“You are stunning Lauren,” gushed a third, along with the love-face emoji and a red heart.</p>
      <p>“Seriously you’re simply perfect,” concluded a fourth, with the heart-eyes face and also two red hearts.</p>
      <p>This is not the only video that Lauren recently shared. Just yesterday, she uploaded a sweet clip filmed by her husband where she flaunted her booty, as covered by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5748173/lauren-drain-funny-booty-husband/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>.</p>
