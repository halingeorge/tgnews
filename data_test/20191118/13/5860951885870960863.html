      <p>Curtis Gregory, Illawarra Shoalhaven Director of Public Health, said this is the first measles case in the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District for 2019 and only the second confirmed case in the last four years.</p>
      <p>“It is a good reminder for everyone to check that they are protected against measles, especially if they are travelling overseas.” Mr Gregory said.</p>
      <p>“Measles is highly contagious and anyone born during or after 1966 should ensure they have had two doses of the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine, which provides lifelong protection in 99 out of 100 vaccinated people.</p>
      <p>“Symptoms to watch out for include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the head to the rest of the body.”</p>
      <p>The man spent time in the following locations while infectious:</p>

      <p>Local public health unit staff are identifying people who have been in close contact with the case and arranging preventive treatment if required.</p>
      <p>Mr Gregory said people who had been in the same locations at the same times as the man should be alert for signs and symptoms of measles until 3 December, 2019.</p>
      <p>“It can take up to 18 days for symptoms to appear following exposure to a person with measles. Anyone who develops symptoms should arrange to see their GP and call ahead to ensure they don’t wait alongside other patients,” Mr Gregory said.</p>
      <p>Measles is a preventable disease that is spread through the air when someone who is infectious with the disease coughs or sneezes.</p>
      <p>NSW Health makes the measles vaccine available free for anyone born during or after 1966 who doesn’t have two documented doses of measles vaccine.</p>
      <p>“If you’re unsure whether you’ve been vaccinated against measles in the past, it’s safe to have a dose,” Mr Gregory said.</p>
