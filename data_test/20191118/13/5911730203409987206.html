      <p>Eye doctors are warning women who get <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/doctors-warn-of-lice-found-in-eyelash-extensions">eyelash extensions</a> about the danger of lice.</p>
      <p>Optometrists say they've seen more cases of "lash lice" due to the new trend. Many people who get the extensions are afraid to wash their lashes because their extensions may fall out.</p>
      <p>Experts say that not washing eyelashes can increase bacteria and lead to infection. Even worse, lice can show up, and they can spread.</p>
      <p>Doctors say cleaning is critical.</p>
      <p>"We recommend tea tree-based cleanser," Dr. Sairah Malik said. "Any cleanser that has a diluted form of tea tree. And it is a good idea to use it on a daily basis."</p>
      <p>Doctors also say that it is a good idea to give your eyes a break from lash extensions every once in a while.</p>
