      <h1>Hunt: We Are Going To Get Hurt In January!</h1>

      <p>Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt expects a tough run of fixtures for his side in the new year as the Clever Boys play catch up in their Absa Premiership schedule.</p>
      <p>Wits find themselves trailing log leaders Kaizer Chiefs by 13 points, although they have four games in hand, many of which they will have to play in January.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the Siya crew on Monday, the coach bemoaned the demanding number of games along with the fact that the Clever Boys have progressed to the group stages of the CAF Confederation Cup.</p>
      <p>“We are going to get hurt in January. We have got nine games, which are obviously our catch up matches – and that is our problem. But it is what it is. We got knocked out of the cups early and were not playing and obviously we have CAF commitments as well. But there were times we could have played, although obviously other teams were playing. It was a bit of a balls-up, but anyway it is what it is,” said Hunt. </p>
      <p>Wits were beaten at home by SuperSport United on November 8 and the coach said that was deflating because they needed a boost.</p>
      <p>“The games in hand mean nothing. We had a game in hand last week and we lost. Not everybody has played the same amount of games. You can’t really get a good perspective of the league. It’s only the truth. We had a good start and last week was a dampener because winning would have taken us up the table. I don’t actually look at the log table because it’s not proper. I look at how many we have played and what we have done,” Hunt said.</p>
