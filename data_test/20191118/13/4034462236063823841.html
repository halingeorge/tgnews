      <h1>Ford Has Big Plans For New Mustang Family</h1>
      <h2>The Mustang Mach-E is only the beginning.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:35:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mach-e">2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E</a> is finally here, a decade after Ford's first electric vehicle, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/focus-electric">Focus Electric</a>. Built mainly for compliance reasons, the Focus Electric can no longer compete with today's modern EVs, and that's where the Mustang Mach-E comes into the picture. Taking advantage of the Mustang muscle car's global popularity, Ford's decision to create a so-called "Mustang family" changes everything. And yes, the Mustang Mach-E is only the beginning.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ford-could-expand-mustang-line-further-future">Autocar</a>, the Mustang nameplate will grow into an expanded family. "The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/introducing-the-2021-ford-mustang-mach-e-an-icon-goes-electric">Mach-E is our step into the future</a>, without ignoring history," Ford's European design chief, Murat Gueler, said. "There's a lot of emotion with the Mustang, and it's time to progress that and make it spread wider."</p>
      <p>Instead of simply applying the Blue Oval emblem to a new EV with its own unique design, Gueler admitted Ford realized it was best to bank on an established and beloved name.</p>

      <p>In fact, "We've talked about building a family" of Mustangs, Gueler added. "The latest Mustang in Europe has gained another level of popularity, so we have a bigger base for the Mustang brand. The Mustang and the Porsche 911 are the most famous sports cars on the planet. Mustang is a big nameplate and it's about time we applied electrification to it."</p>
      <p>In case you haven't already noticed, there is not a single Ford Blue Oval badge anywhere on the car; only the iconic Mustang logo is used.</p>
      <p>While this decision will be controversial for diehard Mustang muscle car fans, Gueler said that "We did our research and customers are totally okay with this. It's the same on the Mustang itself, and it communicates how unique this car is."</p>

      <p>So, what will come next in the Mustang family? A smaller SUV, perhaps? Gueler refused to go into details, but we already know the Mustang Mach-E's all-new electric vehicle architecture is highly customizable, meaning it can be lengthened or shortened as required. One possibility we could see Ford going forward with is a sleek Mustang family sedan on par with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/taycan">Porsche Taycan</a>. Although Ford discontinued traditional sedans and hatchbacks in North America, electrification and the Mustang family nameplate represent a whole new ball game.</p>
