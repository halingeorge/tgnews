        <b>MORE than one in three Scottish Catholic schoolboys hold sectarian views, claims a new study.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Glasgow Uni Professor Stephen McKinney co-authored research which found six per cent of the pupils questioned had "extreme" views.</p>

      <p>But less than a third said they had "positive experience" of Protestants.</p>
      <p>It also found sectarian beliefs were more common among kids who are not practising Catholics.</p>
      <p>The study is said to be the first to look at the beliefs in some of Scotland's 357 Catholic secondary schools.</p>
      <p>Reported by <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boys-cling-to-sectarian-view-22rvmfvpg">The Times</a>, the results read: "The data demonstrated that, although only 6% of Catholic pupils took the extreme view that they would not like to live next door to Protestants, fewer than one third of Catholic pupils affirm their positive experience of Protestants: 31% claim that a lot of good is done in the world by Protestants and 32% are interested in finding out about Protestants.</p>
      <p>“Signs of sectarianism remain among 37% of Catholic pupils who do not feel that they have friends who are Protestants, 35% of Catholic pupils who do not feel that they would be happy to go out with someone from a different denomination, and 43% of Catholic pupils who do not feel that they would be happy about a close relative marrying someone from a different denomination.”</p>
      <p>It continued: “The data demonstrated that religious engagement among Catholic pupils is a significant predictor of lower levels of sectarian attitudes... Catholic pupils least likely to espouse sectarian attitudes are those who regard their religious identity as important, attend church frequently and pray frequently.</p>
      <p>“In other words, sectarian attitudes are associated with nominal Catholics rather than with actively practising Catholics.”</p>
      <p>David Scott, the director of anti-sectarian charity Nil By Mouth, said: “We work with thousands of young people every year and know there are those who harbour sectarian attitudes. This isn’t unique to any one religious or cultural identity.</p>
      <p>“Issues, around football and marches in recent years allied to the toxic atmosphere created on social media, with the culture of self righteousness and certainty this promotes, often creates the platform and environment for attitudes to spill over into aggressive sectarian behaviour.</p>
      <p>"The challenge in unpicking these beliefs is realising that they are a fusion of genuine feelings of identity and a cocktail of immaturity and ignorance in how this is expressed.</p>
      <p>"History is never as cut and dried as many teenagers think and it’s important groups like ours enter into working with young people armed with questions more than answers, creating a space to allow them to consider what they really believe.</p>
      <p>"A chance to look in the mirror as much as to point the finger."</p>
      <p>Peter Kearney, director of the Scottish Catholic Media Office accused the study’s methodology of being “questionable at best and downright dubious at worst”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Although unnecessarily arcane and complex, the study does reveal some interesting findings which are in tune with the experience of staff in Catholic schools. Unsurprisingly, there is no evidence to support the theory that Catholic schools contribute to the formation of sectarian attitudes.</p>
      <p>“Revealingly, however, pupils described as “nominally catholic” are more likely to espouse sectarian attitudes than those who are practising Catholics. Reassuringly, even among the former group only a minority have any intolerant attitudes.”</p>
      <p>In September, we told how a former cop believes <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4728037/catholic-schools-ban-sectarian-violence/">Catholic schools should be abolished</a> - in a bid to end sectarian violence.<br/>Tom Wood, who was deputy chief constable of Lothian and Borders cops, has urged politicians to look at the causes of sectarian violence by binning segregation in schools.</p>
