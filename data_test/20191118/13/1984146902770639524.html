        <figcaption>The stats that have defined Sunderland's season so far</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Phil Parkinson will hand some opportunities to one or two Sunderland academy stars on Tuesday night at Grimsby.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">The Black Cats</a> will be without Jon McLaughlin, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conor-mclaughlin">Conor McLaughlin,</a> Tom Flanagan and Benji Kimpioka, all of whom are away on international duty.</p>
      <p>And with the squad already short due to injuries - Jordan Willis, Joel Lynch and George Dobson will all miss the game - <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> had confirmed he will boost his squad with a few academy players.</p>
      <p>But could the game be a good opportunity to take a look at one or two of them in action?</p>
      <p>Here's a look at the players who could get a chance to impress at Priestfield Stadium.</p>
      <h3>Anthony Patterson</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Patterson has been a regular member of first team match-day squads this season, with Jack Ross saying in the summer he hoped to help the young shot-stopper gain as much experience as possible to potentially take him to the next level.</p>
      <p>He's frequently made the bench lately, with Lee Burge out injured.</p>
      <p>But Burge returned from injury against Scunthorpe on Tuesday and was preferred to the academy star, despite not being 100 per cent fit.</p>
      <p>With Jon McLaughlin away on international duty, Patterson will almost certainly be named on the bench.</p>
      <h3>Bali Mumba</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The 17-year-old made headlines on the final day of the 2017-18 season when he came on as a sub aged just 16 in the win over Premier League-bound Wolves. He was still weeks away from sitting his GSCE's.</p>
      <p>He then started the first game of last season against Charlton and spent a number of weeks around the first team before going back down to the under-23s where he's been since.</p>
      <p>As with most exciting prospects, there's plenty of clamour from fans to see the youngster, but he's been kept out of the limelight recently, with Sunderland seemingly switching his position. Initially a central midfielder, he's been playing at right-back for both Elliott Dickman's side and England's under-19s.</p>
      <p>With Conor McLaughlin and Tom Flanagan both away with Northern Ireland that right-back slot is free. Luke O'Nien or Denver Hume could operate there, but it could also be perfect opportunity to give Mumba a good test in his new position.</p>
      <h3>Brandon Taylor</h3>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article15612938.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Hartlepool-United-v-Sunderland-Pre-Season-Friendly.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Brandon Taylor<cite>(Image: Sunderland AFC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>One who Parkinson namechecked in his pre-match media briefing, as Sunderland have a bit of a crisis on their hands for the game when it comes to centre-backs. Tom Flanagan is away on international duty, while Alim Ozturk has been out injured.</p>
      <p>Parkinson did have Gateshead-born Taylor on the bench at Scunthorpe, while he was also named in the 18-man squad for the Carabao Cup games with Sheffield United and Oxford.</p>
      <p>His impressive performances for the under-23s earned him the opportunity, and it looks like he will be given his chance at Priestfield.</p>
      <h3>Jack Bainbridge</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Marc McNulty (L) and Jack Bainbridge<cite>(Image: Sunderland AFC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The former Swansea and Everton academy player has been impressing at Sunderland since joining last summer and regularly captains the second string.</p>
      <p>He made his debut in the EFL Trophy last season at Morecambe and did well, while showing his capabilities during pre-season also.</p>
      <p>The centre-back is 21 now so will want to start pushing for more first team football soon. With the centre-back concerns noted above, Bainbridge could get an opportunity.</p>
      <p>He will be more than capable if called upon.</p>
      <h3>Ruben Sammut</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article16612558.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Benfica-B-v-Sunderland-Pre-Season-Friendly.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Ruben Sammut of Sunderland takes on the Benfica defence<cite>(Image: Sunderland AFC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sammut joined the club from Chelsea this summer with plenty of pedigree. He'd captained the youth sides of the Blues before his departure.</p>
      <p>And given an opportunity in pre-season, he shone brightly in Sunderland's midfield, with Ross adding him to the Portugal tour squad as a result.</p>
      <p>Ross was impressed with what he saw and said of the 22-year-old: “What he’s done is every time he’s trained with me in the pre-season period, which has been intermittently, he’s made an impression every time he’s been on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“He’s a really, really fit boy, incredibly fit. When young players come over you want them to make an impression and he’s done that, tonight he had a really good impact on the game [against Benfica B].</p>
      <p>“I’m pleased with him, you often get someone who makes an impact early and he’s done that today.”</p>
      <p>But it's been surprising to never see his name mentioned around the first team at all this season - not even on the bench for cup games.</p>
      <p>Sunderland are well-stocked in central midfield, and Parkinson will want to take a look at Grant Leadbitter and Dylan McGeouch, but Sammut is potentially already ready of playing in that first team, and is likely to suit Parkinson's style of play more too.</p>
      <h3>Lee Connelly</h3>
      <p>Connelly has been a man on fire for the under-23s this term, with plenty of goals so far for Dickman's side.</p>
      <p>Ross spoke highly of him before his departure, and named him on the bench for the cup game at Sheffield United, where he was ultimately unused.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article17034541.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Liverpool-v-Sunderland-U18-Premier-League.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Tom Clayton of Liverpool and Lee Connelly of Sunderland in action<cite>(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Last season he made three sub appearances in the EFL Trophy and despite only playing a combined 29 minutes he looked bright. Now a man in fine form, the 19-year-old Scot is surely worthy of more minutes to test what he can do while so in confidence.</p>
      <p>The trouble for Connelly is, Sunderland have Will Grigg and Marc McNulty in need of games to try and build their confidence, while Charlie Wyke has also been closing in on a return to action too.</p>
