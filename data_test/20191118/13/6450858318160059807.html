      <h4>New broadband speed claims guidance</h4>
      <p>In May 2018, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-0105129-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fbroadband%2Fbest-broadband-deals-105129%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asa.org.uk%2Fnews%2Fmajor-change-to-broadband-speed-claims-in-ads.html">ASA issued</a> new broadband speed claims guidance that gives a more accurate representation of the speed you can expect from the broadband package you choose.</p>
      <p>The change followed research into consumers' understanding of broadband speed claims, which found that consumers are being misled by advertising from internet service providers (ISPs).</p>
      <p>Now, ISPs need to advertise the median download speed measured at peak-time or over 24 hours, or a range of download speeds available to the 20th to 80th percentile of users measured at peak time or over 24 hours.</p>

      <h3>What's the fastest broadband?</h3>
      <figure>

        <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6399&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-0105129-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmedia.com%2Fshop%2Fbroadband%2Fcompare.html">Virgin: 100Mbps | unlimited | £25 per month</a>
      </h4>
      <p>Average download speed: 108Mbps</p>
      <p>Virgin's fibre-optic broadband package is very fast and reliable. 50Mpbs is enough for most single users or couples, but if you share your home with a bigger family who tends to use the internet at once, you might want to consider opting for 100Mbps.</p>
      <p>Virgin is currently offering big Black Friday savings on all its plans. The 100Mbps plan is usually £33 per month for the first 12 months with a £35 set up fee, but this deal will save you around £96 per year. Be sure to choose the broadband &amp; phone package to get this cheaper price, as choosing broadband only, without the phone line, is actually more expensive. </p>
      <p>The internet speed is faster than most options offered by rival providers and the average download speeds are even faster than advertised, at 108Mbps. It has won plenty of broadband awards for overall satisfaction, reliability and speed, so is highly recommended.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Average download speed: 362Mbps</p>
      <p>For the ultimate speed, there's the 350Mbps option from Virgin. Again, this is a big saving for Black Friday, as it typically costs £43 per month with line rental included. There is a £35 activation fee however. Again, be sure to choose M350 from the broadband &amp; phone deals. </p>
