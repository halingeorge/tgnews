      <p>Tim HÃ¶ttges, Deutsche Telekom CEO, and Chairman of the Board of T-Mobile US said:</p>
      <blockquote>John Legere has had an enormously successful run as CEO. As the architect of the Un-carrier strategy and the company's complete transformation, John has put T-Mobile US in an incredibly strong position. I have the highest respect for his performance as a manager and as a friend, I am very grateful to him for the time together.</blockquote>
