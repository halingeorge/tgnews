      <h1>Video Shows Upbeat Tua Tagovailoa Playing Ukulele, Dancing Heading Into Surgery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:43:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a serious hip injury on Saturday that will require surgery and cost him the rest of the season. All things considered, he seems pretty upbeat about the whole thing.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa is set for surgery on Monday after dislocating his hip against Mississippi State. One of his friends, a man named Keke Prewitt, posted a video to Instagram late Sunday night that shows Tagovailoa in his hospital gurney in a good mood.</p>
      <p>Sports Illustrated posted the video to Twitter. In it, you’ll see Tagovailoa pulling out some dance moves just a few hours ahead of surgery.</p>
      <p>Prewitt’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kekeprewitt/?hl=en">Instagram story</a> also features Tagovailoa playing a ukulele. It’s one of the coolest things you’ll see today:</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa entered the game against Mississippi State nursing an injured ankle, and suffered the hip injury with his team up 35-7 late in the second quarter. Many are questioning whether he should have been on the field given the situation.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa will reportedly be out six-to-eight months after surgery, but he’s expected to make a full recovery. It’ll be interesting to see how the injury affects his NFL Draft stock – should he choose to leave Alabama after this season.</p>
      <p>As for the Crimson Tide, they’re going to have to get by Auburn with backup Mac Jones and look impressive doing it if they want to have a shot at qualifying for the College Football Playoff.</p>
