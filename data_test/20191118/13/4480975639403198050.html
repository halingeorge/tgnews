      <h1>Canada: CPI likely to recover to 2.0% in October – TDS</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:37:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/sandeep-kanihama" target="_blank">Sandeep Kanihama</a></address>
      <p>TD Securities analysts suggest that Canada’s headline <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">CPI</a> is forecasted to recover to 2.0% YoY in October, with prices 0.4% higher on the month.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“Gasoline prices were little changed on the month despite seasonal headwinds, which should see the year-ago drag from energy diminish by ~0.1pp. Outside of gasoline, we expect natural gas and heating oil to drive a modest increase in energy prices, reflecting unseasonably cold weather across Western Canada during the month. However, this will be more than offset by softer food prices following a pullback in producer-level food prices along with agriculture products.”</p>
      <p>“Stripping out both leaves the ex. food &amp; energy index up 0.6% m/m, with much of this driven by seasonal effects in apparel and telecoms. Looking to the Bank's preferred core measures, we see downside risks, owing to sizeable base-effects.”</p>
