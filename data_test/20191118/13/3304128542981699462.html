      <p>This year’s top Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) candidate Andy Michael Munyiri would like to pursue an Automotive Engineering career later in life.</p>
      <p>Speaking to journalists at his home in Nyeri County after the release of the results on Monday afternoon, Munyiri, who scored 440 marks, said the result came as a shocker.</p>
      <p>“I will like to deal with cars especially the car engines. The hard work my father puts at supporting his family is what inspires most, ” elated Munyiri said.</p>
      <p>Automotive engineering is a branch of vehicle engineering. In the field, engineers research, design and develop vehicles and their sub-systems using relevant technologies in the market to meet customer expectations.</p>
