      <p>After lightning struck, the plane dropped down from an altitude of 36,000 feet to 34,000 feet almost immediately.</p>
      <p>As a result, the pilot initiated emergency protocol and broadcast ‘Mayday’ to nearby stations.</p>
      <p>The air traffic controller from Pakistan responded to the call of the captain of the plane and directed it through the dense air traffic in the vicinity for the remainder of the journey in Pakistani airspace, the report noted.</p>
