      <p>A MEMBER of Mayo County Council has accused the county's TDs of 'having their eyes closed' to planning legislation passing through Dáil Éireann.</p>
      <p>Councillor Al McDonnell said he was stunned to learn that planning permission for a house in west Mayo was turned down due to the potential of the applicants running two motor vehicles.</p>
      <p>The Moorehall-based representative said the decision appeared to be a precedent based on new planning laws.</p>
      <p>“I can only say that rural TDs who let this become legislation have their eyes closed. This kind of thing is not doing rural Ireland any good whatsoever.”</p>
      <p>Councillor McDonnell called for planning meetings to be restored to Mayo County Council.</p>
      <p>“I know we have been prevented by ministerial order from discussing planning issues in public but there is no reason why we cannot discuss planning matters in private.</p>
      <p>“There is legislation being slipped through on a regular basis which is anti-rural Ireland and we are being given little say.</p>
      <p>“It is a total disgrace what is happening.”</p>
      <p>The Fianna Fáil representative said there is a chance for councillors to make a stand on the matter ahead of the drafting of the new Mayo County Development Plan.</p>
      <p>“There is a huge onus on us to respond to what is happening at national level and stand up for rural Ireland.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Cyril Burke agreed with the views articulated by Councillor McDonnell.</p>
      <p>He said new regulations placed an onus on developers to ensure 30 per cent of houses in all new estates are detached.</p>
      <p>“This is not viable for them and it is resulting in the price of a three-bedroom semi-detached rising to €250,000, a cost that very few couples can afford.</p>
      <p>“The reality is that no new housing estates will be built by private developers.”</p>
