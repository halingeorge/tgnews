      <p>As the countdown to the 2019 Best of Nollywood awards begins, the Nigerian movie industry is revving and busy for the biggest night to send forth the year.</p>
      <p>The ingenuity for this year’s BON Awards is targeted at offering a unique perspective on the make-believe industry and red carpet moments sure to spellbind players and stakeholders as the duo of cerebral top Nigerian celebrities would be anchoring the event.</p>
      <p>Gbenga Adeyinka, who is a regular face at the awards, will be sharing the stage with the delectable and Kannywood sensation, Maryam Ado Mohammed, known professionally as Maryam Booth.</p>
      <p>The choice of Adeyinka, who started his career as a Corporate Affairs Manager in an engineering firm, was borne out of his consistency and professionalism in smooth delivery.</p>
      <p>He became popular with his “Shine Shine Bobo” promo for Star Game Show.</p>
      <p>He has also anchored television programmes for AIT, Galaxy TV, MBI and Africa Magic on DStv.</p>
      <p>The self-acclaimed Grand Comedian of Nigeria is a multi-award-winning Nigerian actor, comedian, writer and MC, who speaks various Nigerian languages.</p>
      <p>On her part, Booth, who is to co-host with Adeyinka, came into the acting scene when she was eight years old and has since established herself as an icon in the northern Nigeria media industry.</p>
      <p>She came into the limelight with her hit movie: “Dijangala,” which was released in 2007 and had gone on to be known for her dexterity in playing a wide range of roles in movies.</p>
      <p>Booth is also a model, fashion designer and brand ambassador for several notable brands, including Ajinomoto.</p>
      <p>According to the Chief Executive Officer of BON, Seun Oloketuyi: “This year’s edition of the award will be one of the most intriguing yet to close 2019 for the Nollywood industry, we dare you to be there.”</p>
      <p>The 2018 edition, anchored by Helen Paul, held in Oyo State, while this year’s Best of Nollywood awards will hold on December 14, 2019 in Kano State.</p>
