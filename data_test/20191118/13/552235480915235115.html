      <h1>Celtic and Rangers among Europe's top performers as passing stats underline domestic dominance</h1>
      <h2>Steven Gerrard and Neil Lennon have their sides flying at the top of the Premiership and their style of football appears to be a big reason why.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:00:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> are among the top 10 most dominant teams in European football.</p>
      <p>Passing stats show the pair are way ahead of any other team in Scotland with Rangers sitting third in Europe - just behind Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City and Dutch side Ajax.</p>
      <p>The data from CIES Football Observatory shows that Rangers have made 179 passes in the final third of the pitch while their opponents have made just 59 in the Ibrox side’s third.</p>
      <p>That means <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>'s men make an average of 3.03 passes in the opposing team’s third for every one of theirs.</p>
      <p>Man City top the list with 3.56 while Ajax are second with 3.43.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> also rank highly on the table with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>'s side having a ratio of 2.52. They’ve made 161 passes in their opponents third compared to conceding just 64 in theirs.</p>
