      <p>"In the current global macroeconomic context, banks' low profitability and appetite for risk-taking are among the main challenges for lenders," de Cos explained. "Slowing global economy and geopolitical uncertainties could have an impact on financial stability in Spain."</p>
      <p>As of writing, the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> pair was posting modest daily gains above the 1.1050 mark.</p>
