      <h1>Aimia to revise board in deal with dissident shareholders, plans share buyback</h1>

      <p>MONTREAL - Aimia Inc. has reached a deal with a group of dissident shareholders to revise its board of directors and buy back up to $125 million worth of its shares.</p>
      <p>The agreement ends a dispute with the group led by Charles Frischer that had sought to overthrow half of Aimia's eight-member board.</p>
      <p>Aimia sold its flagship Aeroplan program to Air Canada earlier this year. The deal left Aimia with significant cash on hand, but also questions about its future.</p>
      <p>Under the terms of the shareholder agreement, the company has agreed to a plan to reconstitute its board no later than Feb. 28, 2020, ahead of the company's next annual meeting, to be held no later than April 30, 2020.</p>
      <p>A request for a special meeting of shareholders has been also withdrawn by the requisitioning dissident shareholders and Aimia and Mittleman Brothers LLC, the company's largest shareholder, have agreed to end their legal fight.</p>
      <p>All six of the company's current, non-management directors, excluding Philip Mittleman, have confirmed that they will not stand for election to the board at the company's 2020 annual meeting.</p>
