      <p>Out of seemingly nowhere, Roku devices are mysteriously freezing, crashing, and restarting themselves in an endless, hair-pulling loop. Is it a faulty app? Bad hardware? No one seemed to know.</p>
      <p>This past weekend, I experienced these issues first-hand with a Roku TV, and I never would've guessed the culprit: <b><i>Pokémon</i></b>. Specifically, <i>Pokémon Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> and their wireless capabilities.</p>
      <p>To make a long and frustrating story short, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/dx0lem/my_insignia_roku_tv_is_stuck_in_a_boot_loop/">users on reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/dxc5yg/psa_pokemon_swordshield_causes_roku_devices_on/">figured out</a> that by putting their Switch in airplane mode while playing the new <i>Pokémon</i> games, their Roku device would suddenly stop restarting itself – no need for a factory reset, a return policy, or a sledgehammer. The issue, it seemed, stemmed from <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i>'s Y-Comm feature, which lets players interact online and, in this case, locally.</p>
      <p>As someone who spent hours trying to figure out this reboot problem on Saturday, it's astounding to me that anyone was able to put two and two together and also devise a short-term solution.</p>
      <p>After a bizarre weekend, Roku is now aware of the <i>Pokémon</i>-related bug, and a fix is ready.</p>
      <p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pokemon-sword-and-shield-are-making-rokus-crash-nintendo-switch/">CNET</a>, the company said "a limited number of Roku devices" were affected, and it recommended using airplane mode on Switch. "We are rolling out a software update to resolve [the bug] and impacted users can check for the update by going into Settings &gt; System &gt; Software Update."</p>
      <p>What if the Roku restarts aren't caused by your copy of <i>Pokémon</i>? What if you don't even own a Switch? "If the [issue] is caused by a nearby Nintendo Switch that is not yours, unplug the Roku device from the power source temporarily," according to Roku. "Reconnect to power at a later time, possibly at night time, so that the Roku device can automatically check for an update during the night." <i>Good luck</i>.</p>
      <p>What a wild turn of events.</p>
