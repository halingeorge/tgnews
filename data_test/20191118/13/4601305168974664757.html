      <p>If it's shaped like a golden sponge snack cake, and tastes like a golden sponge snack cake, it must be a golden sponge snack cake, right? Well, not this time. Post Consumer Brands and Hostess have just announced they are introducing a frickin' Twinkies <i>cereal</i> to grocery stores in December.</p>
      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/calling-all-twinkies-fans-it-s-official-new-post-hostess-twinkies-cereal-is-coming-soon-1028686133">From the press release</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Twinkies Cereal replicates the distinctive taste and familiar oblong shape of the golden-colored snack cake, delivering delightful sweetness in every bite...<br/><br/>"In developing a cereal version of the iconic Twinkies, our top priority was focused on delivering the great Twinkies flavor in each bite," said Josh Jans, Brand Manager of Cereal Partnerships at Post Consumer Brands. "Knowing that taste remains the No. 1 purchase driver of cereal, we conducted multiple consumer tests, and the new Twinkies Cereal delivered. We think fans will find that it not only tastes great with milk but also outside the bowl."</blockquote>
