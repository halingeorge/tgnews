Musical.ly was bought by the Chinese tech giant, ByteDance, and merged with its short video app Douyin to form TikTok.</p>
      <p>BuzzFeed found what seems to be Mark Zuckerberg’s personal TikTok account, with the identifier ‘@finkd’. The account is not certified on TikTok, but it is linked to Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram account. Mark Zuckerberg also uses the @finkd ID on his inactive Twitter account. Facebook did not comment on this information when Business Insider US contacted the company. It seems that Mark Zuckerberg is only a ghost on <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/TikTok">TikTok</a>.
