      <p>Workers at a Downtown Eastside Vancouver overdose prevention site say a bad batch of drugs resulted in no less than 18 ODs in just one morning.</p>
      <p>Trey Helten, a manager with the Overdose Prevention Society says there were 18 overdoses by noon on Friday.</p>
      <p>"That's how our day started – it was like a war zone – and it didn't let up until three o'clock in the afternoon," he <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/like-a-war-zone-16-overdoses-before-noon-at-vancouver-overdose-prevention-site-1.4689998">told CTV News</a>.</p>
      <p>The bad drugs are a mix of low-grade benzodiazepine and fentanyl, leaving people in a coma-like state before they can be revived.</p>
      <p>Helten said even the overdose-reversal drug naloxone often fails to revive users.</p>
      <p>Last year, 1,541 people died of illicit drug toxicity in B.C.</p>
