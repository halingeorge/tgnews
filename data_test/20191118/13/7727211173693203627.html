      <h2>"Dear Father Christmas. Can you help. Can we have a home for Christmas?"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T13:03:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/olivia-williams/" target="_blank">Olivia Williams</a></address>
      <p>A seven-year-old child has written a heartbreaking letter to Father Christmas asking for a house and food for her family.</p>
      <p>Local Labour councillor, Gerard Woodhouse who runs the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/grim-reality-desperately-trying-survive-16765645">L6 Community Centre,</a> on Queens Road, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton">Everton</a> posted a photo on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> of the hand-written note asking Santa for help.</p>
      <p>The team at the community building had started decorating for Christmas and had placed a 'Santa postbox' in the caf√© for children who were visiting the centre to post their Christmas wishlists.</p>
      <p>However, as <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/grim-reality-desperately-trying-survive-16765645">Cllr Woodhouse</a> was passing the postbox he found the upsetting note that asked Father Christmas whether he could help.</p>
      <p>The letter read: "Dear Father Christmas. Can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas?</p>
      <p>"Mam wants us to be all together, can you give us some food and can I just have just nice doll for Christmas. Thank you."</p>

      <p>Cllr Woodhouse said the letter shows the reality at how much some families in Merseyside are struggling.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO:</a> "This is what we're in sadly. What is upsetting is a seven-year-old in November is already worrying about Christmas.</p>
      <p>"No wonder young people have mental health problems, it's just so sad.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately it is what we see at the L6 centre.</p>
      <p>"This is just one of many that we're going to see from now until Christmas."</p>
      <p>The councillor said he and the L6 centre team are trying their best to help the family with basic needs such as accommodation and food.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/grim-reality-desperately-trying-survive-16765645">Cllr Woodhouse</a> also believes the amount of referrals the centre will receive this year will increase from the previous year.</p>

      <p>He added: "Referrals are coming in already in November and it is just so sad.</p>
      <p>"Last year was bad, but it is going to be worse this year, we're seeing it now and we don't officially open for referrals - we have over a 100 so far."</p>
      <p>The L6 centre will be hosting a Christmas light switch on on December 2, starting at 4pm.</p>
      <p>A grotto will also be outside for children where they can meet Santa and a series of Christmas events will be hosted throughout the workshops December.</p>
      <p>The team at the L6 Community Centre are giving out more than 20,000 toys for children and will also accepting emergency referrals leading up to Christmas day.</p>
      <p>The centre has also set up a GoFundMe page to support their foodbank and Christmas appeal.</p>
