      <p>Coincidentally, Season 3 of <i>Runaways</i> will <a href="https://www.cbr.com/runaways-cloak-dagger-crossover-confirmed/">include a crossover</a> with yet another canceled Marvel series, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvel-cloak-and-dagger-canceled-freeform/"><i>Cloak &amp; Dagger</i></a>, which was axed in October after two seasons. It will also introduce a new antagonist in the evil Marvel sorceress <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-runaways-elizabeth-hurley-morgan-le-fay/">Morgan le Fay</a>, played by Elizabeth Hurley. The official Season 3 synopsis is below:</p>
      <blockquote>In an action-packed Season 3, the Runaways frantically search for their captured friends Chase Stein, Gert Yorkes, and Karolina Dean. The kids go head to head with an unstoppable enemy who has targeted Leslie — or more accurately, the child she's carrying.</blockquote>
      <p>Streaming now on Hulu, <i>Marvel’s Runaways</i> stars Rhenzy Feliz, Lyrica Okano, Virginia Gardner, Ariela Barer, Gregg Sulkin, Allegra Acosta, Angel Parker, Ryan Sans, Annie Wersching, Kip Pardue, Ever Carradine, James Marsters, Brigid Brannagh, Kevin Weisman, Brittany Ishibashi and James Yaegashi. The series returns for its third season on Dec. 13, with all 10 episodes of the season released simultaneously.</p>
