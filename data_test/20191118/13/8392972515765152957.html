      <p>She told <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a>: "I've been in it 30 years but Coronation Street is 60 next year, and I thought, 'They're going to kill me.'</p>
      <p>"But they're not, they've said they're not.</p>
      <p>"But they've said, and I don't know what it is yet, she will go with a bang.</p>
      <p>"I'm there until probably the summer, and then I'm going."</p>

      <p>Bev also admitted some of her co-stars will have only found out she has quit today, but she did let the likes of Simon Gregson (<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/a-short-history-of-coronation-streets-steve-mcdonald/">Steve McDonald</a>) and Kate Ford (Tracy Barlow) know last night (Sunday November 17).</p>
      <p>She added: "I told some of them last night, like Simon and Kate Ford. They knew.</p>
      <p>"They're really sad, but we'll still see each other.</p>
      <p>"Me and Jon, my husband, and Simon and Emma, his wife, we do get drunk quite often."</p>

      <p>The 62-year-old star insists she will "never retire" from performing, but she admitted losing her good pal and co-star Anne Kirkbride - who died in January 2015 aged 60 - made her feel that life can be "too short".</p>
      <p>Speaking to Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Saira Khan and Gloria Huniford, Bev added: "It does make you realise that life can be too short.</p>
      <p>"We were great friends on-screen and off-screen as well."</p>
      <p>Beverley is departing the show to try her hand at other roles, and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/the-thunder-girls-announce-uk-tour-as-beverley-callard-quits-corrie/">she is also going on tour with Melanie Blake's play The Thunder Girls.</a></p>
