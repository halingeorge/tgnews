      <p>Sending Christmas mail via the British Forces Post Office (BFPO) can sometimes be a bit of a minefield.</p>
      <p>So, we have put together a handy guide on how to get the much needed morale to those you love, while they are serving overseas this Xmas. </p>
      <blockquote>There is also a BFPO app designed to support and connect Forces personnel with their families across the globe. Features include, a list of all BFPO numbers  around the world, a complete list of all BFPO retailers, and helpful reminders of prohibited and restricted postage items.</blockquote>

      <h3>How To Send An E-Bluey Letter?</h3>
      <p>Forces Free Air Letters (FFALs) also known as ‘blueys’, are a way of sending letters and messages free to personnel deployed in certain locations. (pick up blank 'blueys' free from the post office).</p>
      <p>To check if the location you are sending to is eligible for free postage, see the list via the link below.</p>
      <p>Personnel entitled to use BFPO services at these locations are also eligible to send blueys back to the UK free of charge.</p>
      <p>Letters sent to other locations that are not eligible for free postage are charged at the standard UK rate, rather than the more expensive international rate usually charged.</p>

      <h3>How To Send Parcels To A BFPO Address? </h3>
      <p>Under the Enduring Families Free Mail Service (EFFMS), small parcels of up to 2kg in weight can be sent free of charge to certain locations via Royal Mail services. Small parcels must not exceed 45cm in length, width 35cm and depth 16cm to qualify for free postage. </p>
      <p>For sending larger parcels and items not eligible to the EFFMS, can be sent via the BFPO system, but will be charged at the standard UK rates instead of the more expensive international rates.</p>
      <p>Check if the location you are sending to is eligible for the EFFMS on the BFPO website.</p>
      <h3>How To Address BFPO Mail Correctly?</h3>
      <p>All BFPO mail should be addressed as follows;</p>
      <h3>Service Number, Rank, Name </h3>
      <h3>Sub-Unit, Regiment</h3>
      <h3>Operation or location name</h3>
