      <p>A brand new hotel dedicated to all things Nutella is opening its doors, and it's sure to be a hit with chocoholics.</p>
      <p>Hotella Nutella will be located in California's Napa Valley, and it will be offering up the ultimate stay for fans of the hazelnut spread, with new concept art from the brand offering a sneak peek of just what will be on offer.</p>
      <p>We're talking everything from giant jars of Nutella to themed bedding and furniture, as well as breakfast-inspired decor and even an alarm clock shaped like one of the iconic jars, plenty of extra touches featuring the logo, as well as heaps of chocolate treats and surprises for guests.</p>
      <p>Even the walk up to the hotel includes a pathway with a Nutella pattern and an archway shaped like the jar.</p>
      <p>Oh, and of course the breakfast menu will be full of dishes including - you guessed it - Nutella.</p>

      <p>For a start, there's a masterclass on how to create a Nutella Breakfast Dinner led by chef Geoffrey Zakarian, while Tanya Holland will be on hand to help create the ultimate 'Savoury Soul Food Brunch' including Nutella dishes.</p>
      <p>Those looking to up their Instagram game can also pick up heaps of tips from pancakes artist Dancakes who will be sharing some of his tricks on how to create eye-catching pancake art masterpieces.</p>
      <p>Basically, it's the stuff of Nutella dreams.</p>

      <p>The hotel won't actually be a permanent fixture; it's actually a pop-up experience from the brand which is opening for a weekend in January 2020.</p>
      <p>However, don't start booking flights or packing your bags quite just yet.</p>
      <p>There are only three stays up for grabs over the weekend in a competition on the <a href="https://hotellanutella.com/">Hotella Nutella website</a> - and sadly, it's only open to US residents, although we are keeping our fingers crossed that the company might run something similar in the UK if it's a success!</p>
      <p>In the meantime, if you do want to satisfy your sweet tooth, there's always <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/inside-uks-amazing-chocolate-themed-20755289">this chocolate themed hotel in the UK</a> where guests can stay in chocolate-inspired rooms and take part in heaps of fun activities from chocolate tastings to workshops where you can make your own tasty treats.</p>
