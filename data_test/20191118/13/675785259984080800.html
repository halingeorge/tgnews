      <p>A pregnant 13-year-old girl <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/suicide">killed herself</a> after being gang raped by up to six men and held captive in a flat, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>The teenager is alleged to have snapped a photo showing her legs dangling from a roof and sent it to a friend with a message saying: "I’m about to go, I love you."</p>
      <p>The girl also wrote a series of Facebook posts reading "I’m about to go" and "If I wasn’t pregnant, I would have gone a long time ago", it was reported.</p>
      <p>Her mother, who reported the alleged attack to police in Bangkok, Thailand, said it had sent her into a deep depression before she died by suicide last Friday.</p>
      <p>The girl, identified publicly only by her nickname, Pinkie, jumped to her death from a block of flats just before midnight, Thai media reported.</p>
