      <h1>Horrific state of tar-blackened lungs belonging to 30-year chain smoker</h1>
      <h2>WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Medics had removed the organ from a 52-year-old brain dead man who had requested his organs be donated but they were in such an appalling condition they were rejected for a transplant</h2>

      <p>Shocking footage shows the tar-blackened lungs of a 52-year-old man who had been a chain smoker for 30 years.</p>
      <p>The viral video viewed more than 25millions times shows medics removing the organs from the brain dead man after his request to donate them.</p>
      <p>But instead of being a healthy pink colour they are heavily blackened from decades of tobacco residue accumulation.</p>
      <p>The clip - called the ‘best anti-smoking ad ever’ by social media users - shows Doctor Chen Jingyu and his transplant team inspecting the lungs at Wuxi People’s Hospital in Jiangsu, China.</p>
      <p>Dr Chen, who is a leading lung transplant surgeon and also vice president of the facility, said the donor was declared brain dead and his organs were donated.</p>
      <p>However, the medic quickly realised after harvesting that they would not be able to give the lungs to a patient in need on the waiting list, citing issues such as lung calcification, bullous lung disease and pulmonary emphysema - all thought to be the result of three decades of smoking.</p>

      <p>Using the hashtag ‘jieyan’ - Mandarin for ‘quit smoking’ - Doctor Chen wrote: “Many smokers in this country have lungs which look like this.</p>
      <p>“Our team decided to reject these lungs for transplant.</p>
      <p>“If you’re a heavy smoker, your lungs may not be accepted even if you choose to donate them after death.</p>
      <p>“Look at these lungs - do you still have the courage to smoke?”</p>

      <p>Doctor Chen later told local media: “The patient didn’t undergo a CT scan before his death. He was declared brain dead, and his lungs were donated shortly after that.</p>
      <p>“Initial oxygenation index tests were OK, but when we harvested the organs, we realised we wouldn’t be able to use them.</p>
      <p>“We Chinese love smoking. It would be impractical to say that we wouldn’t accept the lungs of all smokers, but there are strict standards.</p>
      <p>“These include lungs under 60 years of age in a patient who has only recently been declared medically dead; minor infections in the lungs and relatively clean chest X-rays are also acceptable.</p>

      <p>“If the above conditions are met, we would consider transplanting the lungs.”</p>
      <p>According to a 2018 study by China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 26.6 percent of the country’s population above the age of 15 are smokers.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the World Health Organization reported that worldwide tobacco use causes 7 million deaths per year.</p>
