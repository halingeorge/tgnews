      <h1>Tyson Relieved: Bafana ‘Put Ourselves Under Pressure’</h1>

      <p>Though it was a dominant display by Bafana Bafana against Sudan at Orlando Stadium on Sunday, Thulani Hlatshwayo feels they put themselves under pressure by only scoring once.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Molefi Ntseki’s side got back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory over the Sudanese in their second 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier at the weekend, with Lebogang Phiri scoring the only goal of the game as they bounced back from the 2-0 defeat in Ghana. </p>
      <p>‘Tyson’, who was at the heart of South Africa’s defence as usual donning the captain’s armband, says that not scoring more was ‘risky’ from Bafana as they chased three points in Johannesburg, but admitted that the goal just before the half-time break came as a welcome boost for the team.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media after the game, the Bidvest Wits skipper said, “I feel like we put ourselves under pressure because we could have scored two or three goals in the first half, and it was risky because they could have gotten one - you could see that their intention was to come and sit.</p>
      <p>“It was important to score the first goal in the first half, and if you look at the time we scored it, it was a critical phase.</p>
      <p>“We kept on knocking and knocking, we could have scored more, and if we didn’t score they’d have been more motivated. When we scored, it meant in the second half they kind of opened, though we didn’t have as many chances in the second half as in the first.”</p>

      <p>Bafana’s next competitive fixtures only come around in March when their World Cup 2022 qualifiers get underway, though at this point they are still waiting to find out who they will face. </p>
