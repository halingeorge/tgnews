      <p>DUBAI: Earlier this year, Hollywood’s Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Hudson and Zoe Saldana were all spotted in the UAE at the same time and it appears that the trio’s Dubai adventures were part of the emirate’s latest tourism campaign and short film, “A Story Takes Flight.”</p>
      <p>The Visit Dubai official website posted three clips — the trailers of the Reed Morano-directed film — on its <a href="https://www.visitdubai.com/en/a-story-takes-flight">website </a>as well as on social media. The clips show each actress exploring a different side of Dubai. The A-list trio is also depicted taking an abra ride across Old Dubai.</p>
      <p>The first video, entitled “Feel the soul of the city,” features Hudson strolling through the alleyways of Souk Al-Kabeer and Bastakiya.</p>
