      <p>A family of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/animals">ducks </a>in New Zealand had a lucky escape last week, after a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tesla-motors">Tesla </a>car swerved out of its way at the last minute.</p>
      <p>The Tesla Model 3, which was being driven in Gisborne, was in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/driverless-cars">Autopilot Mode</a> during the incident - a feature that enables the car to steer, accelerate and brake on its own.</p>
      <p>During the incident, a family of ducks started crossing the road, just as the car came down the road.</p>
      <p>The driver, who remains unnamed, has admitted that he didn’t notice the ducks because of a shadow on the road.</p>
      <p>However, using one of its eight cameras, the car itself detected the ducks, and quickly swerved out of the way to avoid them.</p>

      <p>The driver said: “If it wasn't for the Autopilot function, I think the ducks would not have survived.”</p>
      <p>While Autopilot may have saved the ducks this time, the feature has been blamed for other collisions in the past.</p>
      <p>For example, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/tesla-car-autopilot-crashed-truck-16159323">Tesla hit the headlines back in March</a> after one of its cars was involved in a fatal collision in Florida.</p>
      <p>The incident saw a Tesla Model 3 crash into a semi-truck, sadly killing the driver in the process.</p>

      <p>A follow-up report by the National Transportation Safety Board revealed that the Tesla had Autopilot mode activated seconds before the crash.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Banner was behind the wheel of the Tesla on a four-lane highway in Palm Beach County, when the semi-truck pulled out in front of him.</p>
      <p>Despite having Autopilot mode activated, the Tesla slid under the truck’s trailer, cutting off the top of the car, and killing Mr Banner.</p>
