        <b>Valve has confirmed that Half-Life: Alyx is real. It’ll be shown on Thursday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Valve may be announcing a new title in the Half Life series. Don’t be shocked – it’s not Half Life 3. Instead, it’s Half-Life: Alyx, a VR title designed for the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/valve-to-reveal-its-virtual-reality-headset-the-steamvr-at-gdc-2015/">Valve Index VR headset</a>. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The developer – when they develop things – hasn’t been coy about the development of a “flagship” VR title for their SteamVR platform. Upon the announcement of the headset, the company announced that <i>a </i>game was in development.</p>
      <p>A source has claimed that this title is the next installment in the Half-Life series. Leaked by the same industry insider responsible for the leak of <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/dota-underlords-valve-mobile-android-ios/">Dota Underlords</a>, it’s now known that the title will be revealed during Geoff Keighley’s annual award show The Game Awards.</p>
      <p>The reveal will allegedly be part of a pre-recorded segment where Geoff Keighley  visits Valve’s HQ to talk about the project. The alleged script goes as follows:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Geoff</b>: “But why does this have to be VR only? Which you know is a fair concern for people, right? It’s like, are they forcing me to buy VR to have the next “Half-Life” experience? Is that just ’cause you think the opportunity for innovation was sort of in the VR space with this? You’re not doing a flat screen version of this game, right?”<br/><b>Developer</b>: “Yeah, I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard, but as we said, it began as an exploration of VR,”<br/><b>Geoff</b>: “But then again it brings – obviously to this one, and why this, why now? Some people would probably cynically say, oh Valve has to go back to making games now that Epic’s chippin’ away at Steam, and “Artifact” wasn’t necessarily the hit everyone wanted it to be”<br/>“March 2020, “Half-Life: Alyx” comin’ out, and again, yeah, we’ll do “The Final Hours” next year. You know, it’s been so fun to do those with “Half-Life”, “Half-Life 2”, “Portal”, and that will take everyone through really the past decade at Valve and all that you guys have been through, all the experiments that you don’t know about.”</blockquote>
