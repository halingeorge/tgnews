      <h1>A38 speed limit to be cut while lane is closed for nearly a month</h1>
      <h2>It could cause major delays</h2>

      <p>One lane of the A38 near Burton is set to be closed for nearly a month.</p>
      <p>According to Highways England, work is set to be carried out from 8pm tonight, November 18, until 6am on Friday, December 13, meaning drivers could experience delays on their journeys.</p>
      <p>However, motorists have reported the lane closure was already in place last night.</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/a38">lane of the A38</a> will be closed on the northbound carriageway from the Fradley over-bridge to the start of the Alrewas north exit slip road.</p>
      <p>Highways England has said that this is due to electrical works being carried out in the area from junction A5127 to junction A513.</p>
      <p>A speed restriction to all drivers using the busy carriageway will be in place while the work is being carried out. It is not known what the temporary limit will be.</p>
