      <p><b>(CNN) - </b>Chick-fil-A will no longer donate money to charities with anti-LGBTQ views.</p>
      <p>The fast food chain announced Monday that starting next year it will only donate to organizations that focus on education, homelessness, and hunger.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A's donations and comments from its executives have caused controversy over the past several years.</p>
      <p>CEO Dan Cathy has said the Atlanta-based fast food company supports, "The biblical definition of the family unit."</p>
      <p>Gay rights groups have boycotted and opposed the chain over its stance on same-sex marriage.</p>
      <p>In a statement, gay rights organization 'GLAAD' said customers and employees should "greet today's announcement with cautious optimism."</p>
      <p>Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee called the move a betrayal.</p>
