        <b>The government will go ahead with implementing the new transport law despite all difficulties, Road Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, the law enforcers have been instructed to avoid any untoward incident while applying the law, said Quader in a press briefing at the secretariat on Monday.</p>
      <p>The new transport law, made stricter than before, has been effective on paper from Nov 1. However, two additional weeks went into creating awareness among people about it.</p>
      <p>Quader announced on Sunday that the law was to come into effect as the two-week period ended.</p>

      <p>Bus drivers and their assistants went on strike in parts of the country to protest harsher punishments for traffic offences under the new law.</p>
      <p>In 10 districts in the southwestern region of the country, the transport workers have ‘willingly’ stopped running the buses, Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association General Secretary Mortaza Hossain said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Asked about transport owners and workers’ opposition to the law, Quader said, “The law must be implemented as this is a law passed by the parliament.”</p>
      <p>He then urged all concerned to abide by the law to ensure safety and discipline on the roads.</p>
      <p>“I request all to stay away from calling transport strikes.”</p>
