      <h1>Have the FIA eased the punishment on Williams due to financial problems?</h1>

        <b>During the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>, the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> team released <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a> out of the pit-box when <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> was driving down the pitlane. Kubica went straight into the path of the Dutchman, but they avoided any contact. Williams haven't received the usual punishment for this incident. </b>
      </p>
      <p>For similar incidents, teams get fined and then the driver picks up a time penalty. In this case, this has changed. Kubica was awarded penalty points and the team wasn't handed a fine. It's strange that the other teams are usually fined, but Williams aren't.</p>

      <p>As we know, Williams are under pressure financially. Old parts have been used on the car and Kubica was asked to retire from a race in order to save parts for future fly-away races. It is a sad situation, but perhaps Formula 1 has taken a little account of the financial situation of the Grove team. Williams have sat at the back of the grid for the last two seasons. </p>
