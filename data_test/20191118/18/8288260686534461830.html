      <p>A desperate plea to find a heavily pregnant mum who went missing with her two daughters more than two months ago has been launched by detectives.</p>
      <p>Staffordshire Police issued an urgent appeal to find Hajar Mohammed, aged 35, and her daughters, eight-year-old Reem and six-year-old Marjam.</p>
      <p>They were last seen leaving a Travelodge in Lower Street, Newcastle-under-Lyme, at around 5.30pm on Tuesday, September 10.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Despite enquiries being made by the force's Missing Person Enquiry Team, the family has not been located.</p>
      <p>Detectives from Force CID are now investigating and want help to locate the family to ensure they are safe and well.</p>
      <p>Hajar is 5ft 3ins, of Middle Eastern appearance and was heavily pregnant when she was last seen. She was wearing a beige head scarf and a black floor-length dress.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Marjam and Reem were last seen wearing matching clothing including a pink and light-grey rain coat, a grey t-shirt with unicorn details, light-blue jeans with a unicorn at the top of left leg and trainers that matched their coats.</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 304 of 12 September, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
