Van Halen, 64, was suffering from intestinal issues and abdominal pains. The reaction is believed to have been caused by drugs Van Halen is taking for his throat cancer.</p>
      <p>Van Halen was reportedly released from the hospital on Sunday. Not the time to take bed rest, Van Halen instead spent time rehearsing with his 28-year-old son Wolfgang. The rocker’s son has been his bassist since 2006.</p>
