      <p>Bafana Bafana head coach, Molefi Ntseki explained why the South African national team found Sudan to be a difficult encounter. </p>
      <p>Ntseki’s side secured a 1-0 win over Sudan in their second Africa Cup Of Nations qualifier, this off the back of a disappointing 2-0 defeat to Ghana. </p>
      <p>However, speaking to the media, Ntseki pointed out that all the travelling from Ghana and the Cape Coast back to South Africa, may have been the reason for missing so many chances against Sudan.</p>

      <p>“It was a very difficult match, not in terms of the quality of the opponents but in terms of the travelling arrangements, because of the flights and the bus driving and then having to one session yesterday and play today,” Ntseki told the media after the game.</p>
      <p>“When you look at the game itself we wanted to start on the front foot and we did that but unfortunately we missed too many chances and we ended up becoming anxious. </p>
      <p>“But I think that our players did very well in terms of how they expressed themselves and the structure of our plan,” he added. </p>
