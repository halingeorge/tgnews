      <h2>LFC Stories: Could Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain be the Philippe Coutinho/Nabil Fekir replacement Liverpool might need?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Liverpool Echo</a></address>
      <p>Over recent seasons, Liverpool have been utterly ruthless in the transfer market. The recruitment team have pinpointed areas to be improved,and have subsequently signed the best players suited to those roles.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk arrived to give the Reds backline the authority it so desperately lacked. Alisson Becker was identified when it was clear the goalkeeping position wasn’t one to gamble with. The numbers suggested Mohamed Salah was the man to benefit from Roberto Firmino being Roberto Firmino, and Fabinho seemingly ticked all of the boxes for a Jurgen Klopp No.6.</p>
      <p>And yet despite this quite remarkable ability to come up trumps in the transfer market, one area within the squad has been vacant for quite some time now: The Reds never replaced Philippe Coutinho.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane filled in as the creative hub for the remainder of the 2017/18 campaign while Liverpool assessed their options. Reports emerged in the final few weeks of the season to reveal Lyon maestro Nabil Fekir was earmarked for that role in Klopp’s squad.</p>
      <p>It appeared as though a deal was as good as done. What prevented it from happening isn’t publicly known but people continue to speculate, but one thing is certain: Liverpool went into the 2018/19 season without a new attacking midfielder on their books. The European champions resisted the urge to splash the cash in the summer, meaning three transfer windows have passed since the Brazilian playmaker parted ways with the club, and two have transpired since Fekir was mere hours away from joining the Klopp revolution at Anfield.</p>
      <p>In the eyes of many, it was an oversight by the usually diligent recruitment team. But Liverpool’s 2-1 victory over Genk may have revealed exactly why the Reds held off on making a big-money move for a final third player.</p>
      <p>With Klopp looking to keep his squad fresh, the German tactician tweaked his starting XI. Fabinho anchored the midfield with Gini Wijnaldum and Naby Keita beside him. Mohamed Salah took his usual place on the right, with Divock Origi replacing Sadio Mane on the left. The big shock was seeing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain deployed as a centre-forward. The biggest shock, however, was seeing just how well he seemed to suit the role.</p>

      <p>As shown by his touch map above, he was everywhere on the night. He took to the false-nine role seamlessly. He was dropping deep to help the midfield, while simultaneously creating space centrally for Salah and Origi to exploit.</p>
      <p>He held the ball up well to link play and he was beating opponents in all areas of the pitch. The former Arsenal man was given 75 minutes and he finished the game with an 88% pass success rate. He attempted seven dribbles, completing three of them, while also managing six touches in the box and three shots. Of those efforts, he landed 66% of them on target and scored the winning goal.</p>
      <p>As far as auditions go, it probably couldn’t have gone any better. The standard of the opposition needs to be taken into account, but it’s also worth noting that Genk are no Maribor, who Liverpool put ten past in 2017.</p>
      <p>However, perhaps the most impressive stat of the night was Oxlade-Chamberlain’s six possession regains in the final third. Firmimo’s work rate is hard to clone. The Reds have tried Salah and Mane as centre-forwards in the past and while both of them bring plenty of positives to the position, neither are able to replicate what the maverick No.9 brings to the side defensively.</p>
      <p>But the England international did just that.</p>
      <p>A 75-minute cameo shouldn’t be enough of a sample size to call off the search for Fekir’s replacement, but Oxlade-Chamberlain did more than enough to justify his inclusion in that conversation. In fact, it was a game-changing move on Klopp’s part to introduce this idea into the pool of possibilities.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have shown their tactical nous this season with subtle tweaks to their play. A higher defensive line in certain matches, the use of the full-backs against certain opposition and the right-sided midfielder morphing into a winger with the Reds moving towards more of a 4-2-3-1 when chasing a game.</p>
      <p>To rivals fans, these changes would barely register. But the Reds are all about those marginal gains, which is exactly what these changes are.</p>
      <p>Adding the false-nine position to the Liverpool No.15’s repertoire gives Klopp countless more options. For starters, it allows Salah to remain on the right and Mane on the left, even if the German tactician switches to more of a 4-2-3-1 shape. Centrally, Firmino and Oxlade-Chamberlain are interchangeable, which would’ve been the case had Fekir arrived.</p>
      <p>During the Frenchman’s most prolific season for Lyon he netted 0.65 goals per game. He was averaging 4.32 dribbles during the 2017/18 season on a per 90 basis while completing 3.27 of them. Fekir also averaged close to five touches in the penalty area and finished matches having completed 85% of his passes.</p>
      <p>These stats aren’t too dissimilar to what Oxlade-Chamberlain managed against Genk. Both players have a high volume of dribbles, they aren’t ball magnets in the penalty area and, despite being progressive in possession, neither happen to be overly wasteful. Shots hit the target, and passes find a team-mate.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Firmino this season is actually averaging similar stats to those, too. He’s averaging over three dribbles per 90 and completing well over two in the Premier League. He’s having around seven touches in the box, but it’s worth noting he’s playing in a dominant Liverpool side who see a lot of the ball in the final third. His pass accuracy is close to 80% and he’s landing 40% of his shots on target.</p>
      <p>Very few players deployed in central areas dribble as often as Firmino and even fewer seem to be able to play three roles rolled into one. The South American is a number eight, nine and ten at times. He’s a midfielder in attack and an attacker in midfield. He has a unique playing profile, and it’s why Fekir appeared to be ideal. But like he’s done with so many others, Klopp has managed to align traits a player already possesses with a position in his squad in a way that not many other coaches would or could have done.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain isn’t Firmino’s doppelgänger but he doesn’t have to be. He just has to be a lite version in order for Liverpool to play the football they play while allowing the 28-year-old to have a break from time to time.</p>
      <p>He could well be Klopp’s most intriguing project yet.</p>
