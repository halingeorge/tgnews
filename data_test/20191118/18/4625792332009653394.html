      <h1>'Impeach the bastard right now': House Democrat wants Trump 'out of the White House' immediately</h1>

      <p>Democratic Rep. Dina Titus of Nevada called President Trump a "bastard" and said she is ready for Congress to impeach and kick him out of the White House.</p>
      <p>Titus delivered the remarks in a Sunday night speech at a Democratic presidential primary forum at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas. She told the crowd of Democrats that the 2020 election is "the most important election of your lifetime."</p>
      <p>"The heart and soul of our nation is on the ballot," she said. "That's why our caucus is so important. It's the first step to getting this con artist out of the White House.</p>
      <p>"You know, frankly, I think the House is going to do it, and I'd like to impeach the bastard right now," Titus continued, referencing the impeachment proceedings going on in the House.</p>
      <p>If the House <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-approves-trump-impeachment-process-on-party-lines">impeaches Trump</a>, the president will face trial in the Senate and, if convicted, would then be removed from office.</p>

      <p>After the speech, Titus faced questions from reporters for her profane comment about the president.</p>
      <p>“Well, I guess I just don’t have very much respect for this president," Titus said. "That was just the first term that came to the top of my head."</p>
