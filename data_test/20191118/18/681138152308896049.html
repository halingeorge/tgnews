        <b>Three vehicles have been involved in a collision which closed part of the A12 at the start of rush hour.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Suffolk police have confirmed they now have one lane of traffic moving after they had to briefly close the southbound carriageway of the A12.</p>
      <p>They were called at 4.30pm today to a report that the collision had happened just before the Seven Hills roundabout of the dual carriageway between the Nacton and Foxhall area.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the police said that they could not confirm if any injuries had occurred but that the ambulance service were aware of the incident.</p>
      <p>Standstill traffic is now tailing back to Martlesham Heath despite one lane being reopened.</p>
      <p>The recovery team arrived at the incident at 6.20pm and are hoping to have both lanes open soon.</p>
