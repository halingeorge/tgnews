      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- An Idaho man tossed a dumbbell from hand to hand to break a Guinness World Record for transferring 40 pounds of weight 100 times.</p>
      <p>David Rush, who has broken more than 100 <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Guinness_World_Records/?tps=1">Guinness World Records</a> to promote STEM education, said he accidentally overachieved while attempting the record by using a dumbbell that weighs 42 pounds instead of the minimum required 40.</p>
      <p>Rush had to transfer the dumbbell from hand to hand without both hands touching the object at the same time.</p>
      <p>He managed 100 transfers in 21.69 seconds, beating the previous record of 32.05 seconds. Rush said one early attempt was disqualified when he reviewed frame-by-frame footage and discovered both hands had touched the dumbbell at once during a transfer.</p>
