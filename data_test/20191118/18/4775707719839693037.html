      <h3>Logitech's Adaptive Gaming Kit Launches Today for the Xbox Adaptive Controller</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 18 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Microsoft launched the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n32630/microsoft-looks-toward-accessibility-with-the-xbox-adaptive-controller">Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC) last year</a> with the aim to make gaming more accessible. The controller has been well received, with its two large buttons and numerous ports for various input methods. Users can mix and match their input options to create a customised controller that best suits their needs.</p>

      <p>However, the Adaptive Controller only includes the two large buttons on the device and no extra inputs, leaving it up to the owner to source their own button, thumbstick and trigger inputs. Now, Logitech has partnered with Microsoft and developed the Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit for the Xbox Adaptive Controller which should make finding input solutions a little easier.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/logitechs-100-adaptive-gaming-kit-finishes-what-xboxs-xac-started/">Ars Technica</a>, Logitech product manager, Mark Starret said, "We talked to Microsoft retail — to people in the Microsoft Stores — and they kept telling us, 'We don't know what to recommend to people. People buy an XAC, then ask, 'What [buttons] should go with this?' The guy at the store can't assess the needs. The caregiver doesn't know [from a gaming standpoint] either."</p>
      <p>The Adaptive Gaming Kit features a number of durable buttons and triggers for the Xbox Adaptive Controller. Included in the box are four light-touch buttons which require only a small amount of pressure to activate, two variable pressure-sensitive triggers, ideal for racing games, three small buttons and three larger buttons. It also includes two game boards which the various buttons and triggers can be attached to with the included hook and loop ties. There are also some handy labelling sheets that can finish off the setup and really make it unique.</p>
      <p>The Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit works straight out of the box, much like the XAC, and works with Xbox One for console gaming and Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 PCs. The kit is currently for sale on <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/gamepads/adaptive-gaming-kit-accessories.html">Logitech's website</a> for $99/£89.99.<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Hardware">Hardware<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39744/xbox-adaptive-controller-logitech-adaptive-gaming-kit#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003474100/3474165.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey<br/></a>Hey everyone! I'm Sean. I have been writing gaming content for various outlets over the past few years while studying a degree in Journalism. I grew up on everything PlayStation — mainly Metal Gear Solid, with a brief foray into the world of Xbox. Nowadays, you'll find me mainly playing multiplayer PC games, but with the recent addition of the Xbox Game Pass for PC, I'm looking forward to improving my TA Score.</p>
