The first to win three will receive $1 million and the title of "Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time." The two runners up will each receive $250,000.</p>
      <p>"Based on their previous performances, these three are already the 'greatest,' but you can't help wondering: who is the best of the best?" Trebek said.</p>
      <p>Rutter is the highest-earning contestant on <i>Jeopardy!</i> at $4.7 million, followed by Jennings at $3.5 million and Holzhauer at $2.9 million.</p>
