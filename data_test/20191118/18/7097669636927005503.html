      <h1>Six killed as avalanche buries Indian patrol on disputed glacier</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:23:58+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>An avalanche on Monday hit an Indian patrol in the world's highest militarised zone in the Himalayas, killing four soldiers and two porters, an army spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The disaster was the latest on the Siachen Glacier at more than 5,000 metres (16,500 feet) that is claimed by India and rival Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of troops from both sides have died in avalanches and from the fierce climate in the region over the past three decades.</p>
      <p>An Indian military spokesman told AFP that the avalanche engulfed eight people in the patrol at the northern end of the glacier in the Karakoram mountain range.</p>
      <p>Rescue teams managed to dig the patrol members out of the snow, and they were taken by helicopter to hospital.</p>
      <p>"Despite best efforts, six casualties which includes four soldiers and two civilian porters succumbed to extreme hypothermia," said the spokesman, Colonel Rajesh Kalia.</p>
      <p>Avalanches are common on the 700-square-kilometre (270-square-mile) glacier, where temperatures regularly fall to minus 60 degrees Celsius (-76 Fahrenheit).</p>
      <p>In 2016, 10 Indian soldiers were buried and killed.</p>
      <p>About 900 Indian soldiers alone have died on the glacier since 1984, when Indian forces took complete control of Siachen.</p>
      <p>The glacier is located at the northern end of the Line of Control that divides Kashmir, which India and Pakistan have fought over since 1947.</p>
