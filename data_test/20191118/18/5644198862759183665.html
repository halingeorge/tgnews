      <p>MELBOURNE: Hobart Hurricanes wicketkeeper Emily Smith has been suspended for a year for posting the Women's Big Bash League team's line-up on social media an hour before its scheduled release, Cricket Australia said on Monday (Nov 18). </p>
      <p>The ban, nine months of which are suspended, will rule the 24-year-old out of the remainder of the WBBL and the women's national cricket league, which is played in the 50-over format.</p>

      <p>Smith posted the Hurricanes' team line-up for their Nov 2 match in the WBBL against Sydney Thunder at Burnie on her Instagram account about an hour before it was permitted. The match was later abandoned due to bad weather.</p>
      <p>Cricket Australia said its anti-corruption code prohibits sharing of insider information which could be used for betting.</p>
      <p>The board acknowledged that Smith had no intention to breach the code but there was no excuse for the mistake.</p>
      <p>"Since the commencement of the WBBL, Cricket Australia has had in place a robust anti-corruption program," said Sean Carroll, Cricket Australia's head of integrity and security.</p>
      <p>"We have been working with Emily throughout the process and Emily now understands the mistake she made."</p>
