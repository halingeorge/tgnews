      <p>The Saudi-led Arab coalition announced Monday that the Iran-backed Houthi militias seized a seized a vessel towing a South Korean drilling rig at the south end of the Red Sea.<br/><br/>Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki said the incident took place late on Sunday. The Houthis, sailing in two boats, boarded the vessel and robbed the crew at gunpoint.<br/><br/>This terrorist operation reflects the real danger this terrorist militia poses to international marine navigation, said Maliki.<br/><br/>It also poses a criminal precedent against the security of the Mandeb Strait and southern Red Sea, he added.<br/><br/>In a meeting with the South Korean ambassador to Yemen, Yemeni Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdullah al-Hadrami sharply condemned the seizure of the ship and called for its immediate release, according to a government statement.<br/><br/>“These provocative and illegal actions will negatively affect the freedom of international navigation,” he said.</p>
