      <h1>US extends licence for businesses to work with Huawei by 90 days</h1>
      <h2>Development comes amid discussions between the US and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:28:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:28</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/trump-administration">Trump administration </a>on Monday issued a new 90-day extension allowing US <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>to continue doing business with China's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-huawei">Huawei </a>Technologies Co Ltd as U.S. regulators continue crafting rules on telecommunications firms that pose national security risks.</p>
      <p>After adding <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-huawei">Huawei </a>to an economic blacklist in May citing national security concerns, the U.S. Commerce Department has allowed it to purchase some American-made goods in a series of 90-day licence extensions that it says aim to minimize disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America.</p>
      <p><i>Reuters </i>on Sunday reported the planned 90-day extension after the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/trump-administration">Trump administration </a>initially planned a short-term two-week reprieve, but ran into bureaucratic issues and opted instead to issue another 90-day extension.</p>
      <p>"The Temporary General Licence extension will allow carriers to continue to service customers in some of the most remote areas of the United States who would otherwise be left in the dark," said U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement. "The Department will continue to rigorously monitor sensitive technology exports to ensure that our innovations are not harnessed by those who would threaten our national security."</p>
      <p>In May, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>from using telecommunications equipment made by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>posing a national security risk. The Commerce Department was directed to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October but has yet to publish one.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department is also considering whether to grant individual licenses for U.S. firms to sell components to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-huawei">Huawei </a>after receiving more than 200 requests. No action on those was taken on Monday.</p>
      <p>The development comes amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for over a year.</p>
