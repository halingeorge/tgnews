      <p>MICK MCCARTHY HAS reverted to the tried and trusted as he has named his side to face Denmark in tonight’s decisive Euro 2020 qualifier. </p>
      <p>There are three changes from the side that lost in Switzerland last month, with Conor Hourihane returning to the side alongside David McGoldrick. Matt Doherty replaces the suspended Seamus Coleman. </p>
      <p>Alan Browne keeps his place, and he is likely to line up on the right of the front three with Hourihane slotting into midfield. Formation-wise, it looks like a 4-5-1/4-3-3 from Ireland. </p>
      <p>The team in full: </p>
      <blockquote>Randolph; Doherty, Dufy (captain), Egan, Stevens; Whelan, Hendrick, Hourihane; Browne, McGoldrick, McClean. </blockquote>
      <p>Troy Parrott and Jack Byrne are among the substitutes, with only Callum O’Dowda and Scott Hogan missing out on the matchday squad.</p>
      <p>Denmark, meanwhile, also make three changes from the side that battered Gibraltar 6-0 ahead of this game. Dalsgaard, Poulsen and Cornelius return for a side captained by Simon Kjaer but likely to be inspired by Christian Eriksen. </p>
      <blockquote>Schmeichel; Dalsgaard, Jorgensen, Kjaer, Styger Larsen; Schone, Delaney; Poulsen, Eriksen, Braithwaite; Cornelius</blockquote>

      <p>The permutations for tonight are straightforward. Ireland must win to qualify from the group, while a draw will be enough to qualify Denmark. Both sides are guaranteed a place in the Nations League play-offs regardless of tonight’s result, although qualifying via that route will require winning two, back-to-back games. </p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy said yesterday that he hadn’t yet given the play-offs any thought, and that he “would prefer to get it done tonight.” </p>
      <p>Kick-off at the Aviva Stadium is at 7.45pm. </p>
