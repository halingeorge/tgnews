      <p>Alan Browne has got the nod to start for Ireland in their do-or-die Euro 2020 qualifier with Denmark with Callum Robinson settling for a place on the bench as Mick McCarthy made three changes to the side that lost to Switzerland last month.</p>
      <p>Matt Doherty starts at right back ahead of the suspened Séamus Coleman while David McGoldrick comes in up front and Conor Hourihane starts in midfield.</p>
      <p>Darren Randolph takes his place in goals with Shane Duffy and John Egan again partnering each other in the centre of defence and Enda Stevens resuming the left-back position.</p>
      <p>The five-man midfield is made up of Browne, Glenn Whelan, Jeff Hendrick, Hourihane and James McClean while David McGoldrick will start as the lone striker.</p>
      <p>Ireland know only a victory will suffice to qualify for next year’s tournament while a loss or a draw would leave McCarthy’s men facing the Nations League playoffs in March.</p>
      <p>Denmark coach Age Hareide also made three changes to the side which beat Gibraltar 6-0 on Friday evening with Henrik Dalsgaard, Yussuf Poulsen and Andreas Cornelius returning to strengthen the side. </p>
      <p><b>IRELAND:</b> Darren Randolph; Matt Doherty, John Egan, Shane Duffy, Enda Stevens; Alan Browne, Glenn Whelan, Jeff Hendrick, Conor Hourihane, James McClean; David McGoldrick.</p>
      <p><b>DENMARK: </b>Schmeichel, Dalsgaard, Jorgensen, Kjaer, Larsen, Schone, Braithwaite, Eriksen, Delaney, Poulsen, Cornelius. </p>
