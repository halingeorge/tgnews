      <h1>Ex-UEFA chief Platini slams VAR as 'load of crap'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:47:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Former UEFA president Michel Platini has slammed the use of VAR technology, the introduction of which he has always opposed, as a total nightmare, in an interview on Italian television.</p>
      <p>"It would take half an hour to explain why it doesn't solve problems," the former France international told the "Che tempo che fa" late-night talk show on Rai on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"It shifts them. I'm against VAR. I think it's a load of crap and unfortunately we will not go back."</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old has always been against the use of VAR which he refused to consider after he became UEFA chief in 2007.</p>
      <p>European football's governing body has now also introduced the use of the video replay technology in this year's Champions League.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the former Juventus star believes he could still play a role in football after his four-year suspension from the sport ended in October.</p>
      <p>"At 64, I have the opportunity for one last adventure, but I have no room for error and I have to think about it," he said.</p>
      <p>A triple Ballon d'Or winner, Platini had been expected to succeed Sepp Blatter as FIFA president in 2016 but fell spectacularly from grace a few months earlier.</p>
      <p>The former France captain was suspended by world football's governing body in 2015 over a controversial payment of two million Swiss francs (1.8 million euros, $2 million) that he received from Blatter.</p>
      <p>Platini has always insisted he did nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>"At FIFA, they did not want me as president," he continued.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to defend football and I was the only footballer who could become FIFA president."</p>
      <p>Platini added that he no longer had any contact with either Blatter or current FIFA president Gianni Infantino.</p>
