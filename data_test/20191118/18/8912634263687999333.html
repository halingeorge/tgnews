      <p>SRINAGAR: An avalanche on Monday hit an Indian patrol in the world’s highest militarised zone in the Himalayas, killing four soldiers and two porters, an army spokesman said.<br/>The disaster was the latest on the Siachen Glacier at more than 5,000 meters (16,500 feet) that is claimed by India and rival Pakistan.<br/>Hundreds of troops from both sides have died in avalanches and from the fierce climate in the region over the past three decades.<br/>An Indian military spokesman told AFP that the avalanche engulfed eight people in the patrol at the northern end of the glacier in the Karakoram mountain range.<br/>Rescue teams managed to dig the patrol members out of the snow, and they were taken by helicopter to hospital.<br/>“Despite best efforts, six casualties which includes four soldiers and two civilian porters succumbed to extreme hypothermia,” said the spokesman, Col. Rajesh Kalia.<br/>Avalanches are common on the 700-square-kilometer (270-square-mile) glacier, where temperatures regularly fall to minus 60 degrees Celsius (-76 Fahrenheit).<br/>In 2016, 10 Indian soldiers were buried and killed.<br/>About 900 Indian soldiers alone have died on the glacier since 1984, when Indian forces took complete control of Siachen.<br/>The glacier is located at the northern end of the Line of Control that divides Kashmir, which India and Pakistan have fought over since 1947.</p>
