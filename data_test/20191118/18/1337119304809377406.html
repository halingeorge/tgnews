      <h1>Ford Mustang Mach-E can now be preordered with a $500 deposit</h1>
      <h2>Ford expects the federal $7,500 tax credit to last a full year before expiring</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:48:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-j-hawkins" target="_blank">Andrew J. Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Ford is now taking preorders for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/11/17/20967565/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-specs-price-la-auto-show-2019">its first all-electric SUV, the Mustang Mach-E</a>. The company is currently taking $500 deposits for those wishing to reserve their Mustang Mach-E. But as the automaker noted at its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970193/ford-electric-mustang-mach-e-first-look-photos-video-la-auto-show-2019">launch event in Los Angeles Sunday night</a>, deliveries are still a long way off.</p>
      <p>You can visit Ford’s <a href="https://www.ford.com/buy/mach-e/build-and-price.html?config=WANAB-CGW-2021-CX727#/model">reservation site for the Mach-E</a>, where you can configure the desired trim, paint color, battery pack, and more. As mentioned previously, Ford is offering a veritable smorgasbord of different versions of this car in an effort to cast as wide a net as possible.</p>
      <aside>Ford said it expects the full tax credit to last for about a year once the Mach-E goes on sale</aside>
      <p>The cheapest version is the $43,895 Select (or $44,995 when taking into account delivery costs), which comes standard with 255 horsepower, a 75.7kWh standard range battery pack, and a driving range of 230 miles.</p>
      <p>But that can drop to $37,495 for US customers when taking into account the $7,500 federal tax credit. At the event, Ford said it expects the full tax credit to last for about a year once the Mach-E goes on sale — which explains why the company is hyping up the reservations.</p>
      <p>The most expensive version is the $61,600 Mustang Mach-E GT, with an extended range battery and performance package that can go from 0–60 mph in mid-three seconds.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it will be a while before the Mach-E begins appearing in driveways around the country. Ford says deliveries won’t begin until “late 2020,” and some versions of the car, like the GT, won’t go on sale until spring 2021.</p>
