      <h1>'Kevin &amp; Bean' Alum Lisa May Is Leaving KLOS-FM</h1>
      <h2>Radio personality joined the Southern California classic rock station after being fired from KROQ’s “Kevin &amp; Bean” in 2015</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:07:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/tony-maglio/" target="_blank">Tony Maglio</a></address>
      <p>Lisa May, a lifer on the Southern California radio circuit, is leaving 95.5 KLOS-FM and the “Frosty, Heidi &amp; Frank” (“FHF”) morning show.</p>
      <p>May made the announcement Monday morning following “FHF’s” 7:45 a.m. local time news break. In a follow-up email, May told TheWrap that she and her family are “moving to Palm Springs at the end of the year,” accelerating a plan she had in place since buying a home there in 2015 — the same year she was <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kroq-personality-lisa-may-breaks-silence-on-being-fired-from-kevin-bean-show/">fired from KROQ’s “Kevin &amp; Bean” show</a> and <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/allie-mac-kay-death-threats-replacing-lisa-may-kevin-and-bean/">replaced by Allie Mac Kay.</a></p>
      <p>May is not retiring, she told us — but radio may not be in her future. Or at least, it won’t be her primary professional focus.</p>
      <p>“Two years ago, when I was looking in the Coachella Valley for a high intensity, super-slow strength training studio similar to Strength Code in Toluca Lake and found nothing, I decided rather than stop the workout, I’d have to open up a studio,” she wrote. “I moved forward and got my personal training certification and my high intensity training certification… and eventually started training some clients on the weekends.”</p>

      <p>“I love it, and I think the Coachella Valley is filled with active older adults who could benefit from this type of training,” May said. But I have to say, this has been a tough decision. Walking away from the ‘FHF Show’ was not an easy decision. I love this job and all my co-workers and I’ve been extremely happy here.”</p>
      <p>“I know it’s going to be a huge adjustment,” she said.</p>
      <p>May said KLOS-FM program director Keith Cunningham “has been extremely supportive.”</p>
      <p>“I gave notice about five weeks ago and I wasn’t sure how it would be handled, but he and the station have been awesome, allowing me to leave with a bit of a fanfare,” she told us.</p>
      <p>May’s former employer “Kevin &amp; Bean” is also undergoing major changes. After a near-30-year tenure that helped launch the careers of Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla, among many others, Gene “Bean” Baxter departed the popular KROQ morning show earlier this month.</p>
