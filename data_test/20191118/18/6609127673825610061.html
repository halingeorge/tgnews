      <p>The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said it was “simply not on” that his party had been excluded.</p>
      <p>He said: “This is a democratic outrage.</p>
      <p>“The SNP have won the last three Scottish elections, the last two Westminster elections – we are the party of government in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“The last poll in Scotland showed us with a 20-point lead against our nearest challengers.”</p>
      <p>First Minister Ms Sturgeon previously said her party's exclusion would be a “fundamental breach of broadcasters’ obligations” to reflect views from across the UK.</p>
      <p>She had said: “It is also entirely possible that we will hold the balance of power in the House of Commons after this election - making it all the more important that our perspective is heard and indeed scrutinised.”</p>
      <p>Lib Dem Education spokesperson Layla Moran tweeted: “The court ruled against us. But the fight must continue! It is outrageous that the #RemainVoice is missing from the ITV debate.</p>
      <p>“It’s simply wrong of broadcasters to present a binary choice and pre-empt the decision of the people in a general election.”</p>
      <p>Tomorrow’s head-to-head contest will be the first in a series of debates scheduled to take place in the run-up to the December vote.</p>
      <p>ITV is set to host a multi-party debate on December 12.</p>
      <p>And the BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn on December 6.</p>
