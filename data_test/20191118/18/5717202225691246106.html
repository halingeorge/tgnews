      <h1>Report: Liverpool sweating on fitness of Andrew Robertson and Mo Salah but Joe Gomez should be injury-free</h1>
      <h2>All three players pulled out of international duty.</h2>

      <p>Andrew Robertson and Mo Salah could miss the next game with ankle injuries, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-injury-17274638">The Liverpool Echo reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has two fresh injury concerns for this weekend. Both Robertson and Salah aggravated pre-existing ankle knocks during the 3-1 win over Manchester City prior to the international break.</p>
      <p>Salah’s injury flared up after a sliding challenge from Fernandinho, while Robertson was hurt by a tackle from Rodri. Both players had to drop out of international duty because of this.</p>

      <p>Egypt star Salah did not play in the AFCON qualifiers after undergoing a scan in Cairo. Meanwhile, Robertson dropped out of the Scotland squad because he did not want to make his ankle worse.</p>
      <p>Joe Gomez was also a concern for the upcoming game against Crystal Palace. However, the 22-year-old, who dropped out of the England squad with a knee injury, is expected to be fit for the weekend.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Losing Robertson and Salah presents Klopp with two major selection concerns. Firstly, he has to find someone to fill in at left-back to replace Robertson. This will probably be James Milner, who is reliable but not as impressive as Robertson.</p>
      <p>Salah’s absence would break up the front three with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. Divock Origi will eye a starting spot while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Adam Lallana are also in contention.</p>
