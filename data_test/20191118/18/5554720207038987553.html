      <p>The reason for the fight is not known, but the video released by Colors TV shows Siddharth asking Asim for oranges. Asim refuses to oblige, making Siddharth lose his cool. When asked by Siddharth why he had refused to give him oranges, Asim told him that he did not appreciate his angry approach.</p>
      <p>An incensed Siddharth then pushes Asim violently. But <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/shehnaaz-gill-blamed-for-breaking-siddharth-shuklas-friendship-with-asim-riaz-angry-fans-vent-ire-on-social-media/272208/">unlike the last time</a>, this time Asim refuses to take it lying down and pushes Siddharth back violently too. Soon, housemates intervene pushing both of them away.</p>
      <p>The violence involving the two erstwhile friends came as a shock since both had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/truce-after-fight-siddharth-shukla-shows-why-asim-riaz-needs-him-as-friend-on-bigg-boss/272320/">made amends</a> after the last week’s brewing tension. On Monday night, Siddharth had nominated Asim to be saved from this week’s nomination. While explaining his reason, Siddharth had spoken highly of his friendship with Asim.</p>
      <p>The fight between Asim and Siddharth has evoked strong reactions from social media users.</p>

      <p>This latest fight between Siddharth and Asim was coming as they were seen arguing with each other seemingly over Siddharth’s growing proximity with Devoleena.</p>
      <p>After Monday night’s nomination process, Aarti Singh, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, Rashmi Desai and Khesari Lal Yadav were singled out to face this week’s eviction process. Siddharth is already nominated by Bigg Boss for two weeks for his violent behaviour towards Mahira Sharma.</p>
