      <h1>National Express passengers 'covered in glass' after window smashed by street light</h1>
      <h2>One man forked out £190 for a taxi to make sure he didn't miss his flight to Mexico</h2>

      <p>This was the scene on a National Express coach this morning after the driver turned down a narrow road and crashed into a street light.</p>
      <p>Passengers onboard the bus said glass went "over everyone" after a window smashed in Bridgwater, Somerset, while the driver was attempting a manoeuver.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there were no reports of any injuries.</p>
      <p>One passenger, Daniel Schofield from Cornwall, said he had to fork out £190 for a taxi to make sure he got to the airport on time after his journey was delayed.</p>
      <p>He had to be at Gatwick Airport this morning to catch a flight to Mexico.</p>
      <p>He said the company did transfer passengers to an alternative coach but that they were delayed by more than two hours.</p>

      <p>He said: "I got it last night at 10.20pm [from Newquay] and didn’t get to Gatwick till 10.10am. The gate was closing at 10.20am I think.</p>
      <p>"I had to pay £190 for taxi from Heathrow to Gatwick but couldn’t get a receipt as was rushing."</p>
      <p>Mr Schofield added that he thinks the driver took a wrong turn.</p>
      <p>"They went down a lane that was tight and the bus was pushing against the light then the pressure got to much and smashed in with the light actually being inside the bus," he said.</p>
      <p>"The glass went over everyone but it smashed into so many pieces."</p>
      <h3>Refunds for passengers</h3>
      <p>National Express has said it will refund all passengers who were on the bus.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the company said: "We can confirm that the vehicle on the 406 Penzance to London service on Sunday 17 November collided with a street light on St Mary’s Street in Bridgwater whilst the driver was attempting a maneuver at low speed.</p>
      <p>"There were no reported injuries to customers who were able to continue their journeys, either by taxi or a replacement vehicle.</p>
      <p>"An automatic refund is being made to all passengers on board and we will reimburse any additional costs for their onward travel incurred as a result of the delay."</p>
