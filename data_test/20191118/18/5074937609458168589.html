      <h1>Youth in Export Programme launched in Koforidua</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:09:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author">Georgina Sefakor Agyen, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Koforidua, Nov. 18, GNA - The Ghana Export Promotion Authority (GEPA) in collaboration with the Youth Employment Agency (YEA) has launched a Youth in Export Programme (YIEP) to encourage the youth to venture into the export trade.</p>
      <p>This initiative seeks to promote employment among graduates of the various tertiary institutions in the country.</p>
      <p>Mr George Adomako, the Eastern Regional Director of GEPA, said this in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) at Koforidua in the Eastern Region.</p>
      <p>He said the Authority is currently going through the applications of those who responded to the initiative and those who would be selected would have to go through a training process.</p>
      <p>Mr Adomako said as part of the training, the applicants would be assigned to some selected experienced and successful exporters.</p>
      <p>He said the trainees are expected to understudy the seasoned exporters to enable them become successful exporters.</p>
      <p>Mr Adomako said it is expected that with the introduction of young people into the export trade, it could help boost the exports of the country.</p>
      <p>He said the initiative is also expected to help the youth to gradually replace the current crop of exporters many of whom have advanced in age.</p>
      <p>Mr Adomako said under the YIEP, there would be another programme called Youth in Export Competition (YEC).</p>
      <p>He said under the YEC, graduates of the tertiary institutions would be required to write proposals on how to add value to the countryâ€™s agriculture produce for export.</p>
      <p>Mr Adomako said the good proposals among the lot that would be presented would be selected and the writers of the selected proposals would be supported to implement their proposals.</p>
      <p>Mr Adomako urged the graduates of the tertiary institutions to take advantage of the initiatives to enter into the export business to create wealth for themselves and the country.</p>
