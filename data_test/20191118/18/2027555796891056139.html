      <p>Britain remains "seriously concerned" by escalating violence in Hong Kong and urges the authorities to agree "to a path to resolve the situation", a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.</p>
      <p>"We remain seriously concerned by the situation in Hong Kong and the escalation of violence between protesters and police. We continue to urge for calm and restraint on all sides and support the right to peaceful protest," the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"We believe political dialogue is the only way forward and we want to see the Hong Kong authorities agree to a path to resolve the situation," he said, adding Johnson had no plans as yet to make calls to the authorities.Â </p>
