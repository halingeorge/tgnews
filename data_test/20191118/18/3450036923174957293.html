      <p>Bruce Bagley was arrested Monday in Florida. The 73-year-old <a href="https://twitter.com/univmiami?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">University of Miami </a>professor was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and two counts of money laundering.</p>
      <p>A message seeking comment was left with his attorney.</p>
      <p>Bagley is a co-author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trafficking-Organized-Crime-Violence-Americas/dp/0813054664">Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime and Violence in the Americas Today</a>,” published in 2015.</p>
