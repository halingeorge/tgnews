      <h2>The most valuable players in the Championship have been ranked</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:42:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>The astronomical prices in the transfer market are widely reported and new data has identified which players in the Championship are worth the most money.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/championship/marktwerte/wettbewerb/GB2">Collated by TransferMarkt</a> , the prices reflect the value of each player and would not be the fees they would receive if they were to complete transfers, which is why some of the valuations may not be as you would consider.</p>
      <p>Overall, Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic is ranked as the most valuable player with a mouthwatering valuation of £22.5m, putting him £9m ahead of team-mate Tom Cairney in second place.</p>
      <p>Despite Stoke City’s struggles this season, Jack Butland is joint third with a valuation of £10.8m, with Brentford’s Ollie Watkins, Leeds United’s Helder Costa, Fulham’s Alfie Mawson and Huddersfield Town’s Terence Kongolo all given the same price.</p>
      <p>Fulham have the most players in the top 25 with a total of six, while Stoke City and Huddersfield Town both have four, with Leeds United on three and Brentford on two as the only other clubs to have more than one.</p>
      <p>Cardiff City, Middlesbrough, Hull City, Blackburn Rovers, Bristol City and Nottingham Forest all have one player in the top 25.</p>
