      <p>Muscat: As part of its strategy set in place to fulfil its vision of becoming a world-leading Omani service company, that helps customers, communities and people to prosper and grow, and coinciding with the celebrations of the 49th National Day, Sohar International announced and revealed plans for its landmark new headquarters during a recent press conference.<br/><br/>The press conference was held at ‘W’ Hotel under the auspices of Engineer Isam Saud Hareb Al Zadjali, Chairman of Muscat Municipality led by Mohammed Mahfoudh Al Ardhi, Chairman of the Board of Directors at Sohar International. Chief Executive Officer of Sohar International, Ahmed Al Musalmi, and other executive members of the bank’s leadership was also present at the conference representing the bank.<br/><br/>The press conference initiated with a welcome note from Sohar International followed by an inaugural speech by Al Ardhi. Following the speech, the bank unveiled a 3-D model of the new headquarters alongside a walk-through video of the exteriors and interiors of the premises. Shining more light on the design aspect, Santiago Calatrava, chairman, Calatrava International took the audience around the design and the conceptualisation of the state-of-the-art building. The event also included an interactive Q&amp;A session and was concluded with the chairman felicitating the guest of honour with a memento as a token of appreciation.<br/><br/>Speaking at the event, Al Ardhi stated: “A first-of-its-kind in the world, and the only Calatrava design in the country, this building will bring an architectural revolution to Oman’s cityscape. It’s a matter of great pride for us to reveal the design of our new headquarters in Oman along with the celebrations of the 49th National Day.”</p>
      <p>He further added: “We are excited to embark on this exciting journey of establishing a legacy as a leader in Oman’s banking sector. Over the years, we have witnessed the transformation of Oman’s banking sector and its contribution to the national economy and development. As Sohar International continues its ambitious plan towards becoming a global and world-leading Omani Service Company, this building will bring tangible and intangible benefits that differentiate us further and creates more value to our stakeholders.”<br/><br/>The state-of-the-art facility is aimed at delivering a seamless and rewarding experience to the bank’s customers while providing its employees with a high-performance and agile workplace. Located at Airport Heights Road, Sohar International’s new headquarters will be an iconic building in Muscat city’s skyline. The futuristic design consists of an exterior façade that will feature a one-sided surface with a single boundary and will twist and fold unto itself, conveying the appearance of two interlocking ellipses, resembling Sohar International’s quintessential brand logo. The new headquarters is near the Muscat International Airport with a road connected to the Sultan Qaboos Street that wraps around the entire building offering expansive views of the landscape. Poised to become an architectural centrepiece of the city, the cutting-edge design will capture the company’s vision to connect with customers worldwide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Commenting on the design, Al Musalmi said: “The new head office embellishes the brand’s new identity and encapsulates the brand’s strategy. A milestone in our journey, this building will establish the brand’s energy and potential of becoming leaders in Oman’s banking sector. This building will help us serve our customers even better as I believe our new head office will infuse more vigour and confidence to the brand thus developing a more attractive, efficient, and effective banking environment. The shift towards larger and more efficient banking office is part of our strategic vision of providing more velocity, move value and more vision to our customers’ daily lives and employees work environment alike.”<br/><br/>“The new headquarters will enable customers to interact with us in a friendlier, open environment that is equipped with the latest technology to support their overall banking experience,” he added further.<br/><br/>Sohar International’s upcoming new headquarter will be emblematic of the bank’s growing strength and will pay testimony to its commitment and conviction in the future of the nation.<br/><br/>Commenting on the sign-off, Gabriel Calatrava Design Partner Calatrava International said, “Our design vision for Sohar International is to create a functional building derived from a Mobius surface rooted in mathematics while capturing Omani’s natural heritage and traditions. Our main goal, together with the client, is to build a sculptural beacon to the Sultanate of Oman’s Capital.”<br/><br/>This activity reflects the new era for Sohar International and its journey in transformation into a business enterprise. The bank’s vision, strategy and brand revolve around innovative and disruptive thinking to fundamentally transform the way banking was done. With a new vision, strategy and purpose in place, the bank is implementing all of these components, rethinking business models, improving competitiveness, and creating newer products. Sohar International challenges conventional thinking and innovatively uses its resources to drive a positive change in the lives of its customers and communities in helping them to ‘Win’.</p>
