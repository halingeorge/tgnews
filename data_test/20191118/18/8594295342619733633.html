      <h1>Fiat Chrysler-UAW Bargaining May Not Be a Breeze</h1>

      <p>After UAW-affiliated Ford workers ratified a collective agreement Friday, Fiat Chrysler is next — and last — in line to hammer out a deal with the union. Ford has an easy go of it, requiring just five days of bargaining before reaching a tentative deal; earlier, General Motors suffered financial hardship after its U.S. workforce walked off the job for 40 days.</p>
      <p>Being first at the table, GM’s bargaining is seen as the heaviest lifting of the Detroit Three. Its deal serves as a model for others to follow, and you can be sure the wage increases, pathways to full-time employment, and status-quo healthcare benefits contained within will be held up by UAW bargaining team members when they face the FCA team.</p>
      <p>However, for FCA, the nature of the automaker’s workforce could make reaching a deal a rocky journey.</p>
      <p>As illustrated by <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/fiat-chrysler-s-dilemma-lose-labor-cost-edge-or-risk-a-strike">Bloomberg</a></i>, FCA’s record profits is in part a result of lean labor costs. Thirteen percent of the automaker’s American workforce is made up by temporary workers, which is a higher slice than at Ford or GM.</p>
      <p>In 2019, hourly labor costs at FCA average $55 an hour — a figure that groups wages, payroll taxes, benefits, and worker’s compensation insurance. At Ford, it averages $61 an hour, while each GM worker costs the company, on average, $63 an hour.</p>
      <p>Last time FCA hammered out a deal with the UAW, workers rejected the first draft handed their way, seeking instead higher signing bonuses and a better wage increase for temporary employees. The same could happen this time around if FCA doesn’t pony up and start acting like its Detroit rivals.</p>
      <p>There’s also the chance that, if FCA holds the line too much, workers will walk off the job. That’s not an appealing prospect for an automaker attempting a merger with France’s Groupe PSA.</p>
      <p>As Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy wrote late last week, FCA “would do well to buy more labor peace in cash upfront instead of having fixed costs.”</p>
      <p>“Gains by [temporary and in-progression workers], if applied to FCA, would materially increase cost, possibly a hit to operating margins in the range of 300 basis points, and could significantly shrink FCA’s labor advantage over its rivals Ford and GM,” Murphy wrote.</p>
      <p>While labor costs don’t make up a major part of a vehicle’s sticker price, it’s not inconsequential. Compared to foreign automakers operating in the U.S., FCA’s labor costs are just $5 an hour greater, placing it closer to the likes of Toyota and Honda than Ford or GM.</p>
      <p>According to Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research, FCA may have to open its wallet and swallow the unwanted costs.</p>
      <p>“It might be that it’s time to pay the difference on that average hourly labor cost advantage that the company has enjoyed a decade here,” she told <i><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/chrysler/2019/11/17/temporary-progression-employees-biggest-challenge-uaw-talks-fiat-chrysler/2519484001/">The Detroit News</a></i>.</p>
