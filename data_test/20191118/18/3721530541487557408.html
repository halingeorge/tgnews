      <p><i>The Expanse</i> is back for a fourth season, and today it dropped a wild new trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/TFdzpVt5rbk">on YouTube</a>. You can also watch it embedded above.</p>
      <p>The hard science fiction series by Alcon Entertainment premiered on the Syfy channel in 2015, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/5/11/17344580/the-expanse-canceled-syfy">but was canceled just three years later</a>. Now it’s found <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/22/18192825/the-expanse-season-3-streaming">a new home on Amazon Prime</a>, with the entire cast and crew making the transition more or less unaffected by the change.</p>
      <p>Season 4 takes place during the events of <i>Cibola Burn</i>, the fourth book in The Expanse series of novels by James S. A. Corey (the pen name of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/7/17660410/the-expanse-tabletop-rpg-kickstarter-green-ronin">authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck</a>). It tells the story of a group of Belters — humans who have created their own distinct culture and physiology after living in space for generations — who are the first to land on an alien planet. Opposing them are the corporate security forces of Royal Charter Energy, working under the authority of the United Nations.</p>
      <p>For a series that has spent so much time in space, this next season will be quite a departure for fans. Expect lots of ground-pounding, as well as storylines about the challenges of Belters adapting to life at the bottom of a gravity well.</p>
