      <h1>Asus launches a $70 Wi-F 6 network card to boost your desktop’s wireless speed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:46:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/" target="_blank">Paul Lilly</a></address>
      <p>Asus has gone and quietly introduced a PCI Express expansion card (<a href="https://www.asus.com/Networking/PCE-AX3000/overview/">PCE-AX3000</a>) that adds Wi-Fi 6 connectivity to your desktop PC. Under the right circumstances, it can boost the wireless speed of your system, though other gear is required.</p>
      <p>Namely, you also need a Wi-Fi 6 router to take full advantage of a Wi-Fi 6 adapter. The reason why is because Wi-Fi 6 is a next-generation standard (also known as 802.11ax) that introduces features not supported by previous generation Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) hardware.</p>
      <p>The biggest benefit of Wi-Fi 6 is that it is better equipped to handle multiple devices at the same time. A typical home might have up to around a dozen connected devices, when you factor in desktops, laptops, smart TVs, game consoles, smartphones, smart speakers, tablets, and everything else. Wi-Fi 6 was designed with this in mind.</p>
      <p>There's also a very big caveat—to fully utilize Wi-Fi 6's benefits, both the router and host adapters have to support the standard. The vast majority of wireless devices have not yet adopted Wi-Fi 6. So, plopping a Wi-F6 6 network card into your desktop will have a limited benefit, even if you've also purchased a Wi-Fi 6 router.</p>
      <p>This is more about future proofing, as far as that is possible. The good news is, Wi-Fi 6 hardware is backwards compatible, so you could install the PCE-AX3000 into your desktop and connect to your Wi-Fi 5 router just fine.</p>
      <p>At full bore, the PCE-AX3000 supports speeds of up to 2,402Mbps on the 5GHz channel and 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz channel. It also offers Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity.</p>
      <p>Pricing is a little steep, though. It's available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pce-AX58BT-Next-Gen-Wireless-Adapter-Bluetooth/dp/B07XLP199J">preorder on Amazon for $69.99</a>, and will be "in stock on November 24." It's based on an Intel AX200 M.2 Wi-Fi module that sells for around $20, so you're basically paying extra for the PCIe card form factor and external antennas.</p>
      <p>It's also one of the more expensive PCIe card solutions, even without factoring in potential <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> that might loom around the corner.</p>
