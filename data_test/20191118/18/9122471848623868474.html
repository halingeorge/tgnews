      <h1>Alabama Issues Statement Following Tua Tagovailoa’s Surgery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:06:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending injury on Saturday. Now just two days later, the Crimson Tide QB has undergone a successful surgery.</p>
      <p>Alabama issued a statement updating Tagovailoa’s status following the operation on Monday morning. It appears everything went well and the star player will begin his rehab in the next few days.</p>
      <blockquote>“Tua underwent successful surgery on his right hip Monday morning in Houston. The procedure went as planned and he is resting comfortably. Tua’s prognosis is excellent &amp; we expect him to make a full recovery. He will return to Tuscaloosa in the next several days to begin his rehab.”</blockquote>

      <p>This is fantastic news for Tua, the Tagovailoa family and the Alabama players and fans. Tagovailoa has been a leader for the Crimson Tide over the past few seasons. His elite skill-set and on-field leadership will certainly be missed.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa suffered the season ending injury late in the first half against Mississippi State on Saturday. The Crimson Tide were leading 35-7 at the time of the injury. Head coach Nick Saban is <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/kirk-herbstreit-reacts-nick-saban-playing-tua-tagovailoa">receiving plenty of the blame for the situation</a>. Many felt Saban shouldn’t have kept Tagovailoa in the game for as long as he did.</p>
      <p>Now, backup QB Mac Jones now takes command of the Crimson Tide offense. Alabama has two regular season games remaining with contests against Western Carolina and Auburn in the Iron Bowl.</p>
