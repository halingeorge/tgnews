      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/who-plays-lydia-in-emmerdale-and-where-have-you-seen-actress-karen-blick-before-11058442/">Emmerdale’s Lydia Hart (Karen Blick)</a> has had a rough few months in Emmerdale – and things aren’t about to get better any time soon.</p>
      <p>She’s already had to face the trauma of her troubled past, when the remains <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/09/emmerdale-spoilers-lydia-hart-exits-after-her-dark-secret-is-revealed-10076353/">of the stillborn baby she gave birth to as a teenager were discovered over the summer</a> – and now she’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/emmerdale-spoilers-lydia-hart-makes-surpising-discovery-tonight-11056599/">made the shocking discovery</a> that her mum, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/emmerdale-spoilers-lydia-hart-discovers-her-mum-is-dead-but-its-a-lie-11056773/">who she believed to be dead, is actually alive.</a></p>
      <p>However when her mum does appear on the scene she brings with her the devastating news that her father passed away as a result of Huntington’s Disease – and there’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/emmerdale-spoilers-devastating-illness-storyline-for-lydia-hart-10971861/">a likely chance that Lydia could have the same thing.</a></p>
      <p>The character’s devastated by the news, and faces a difficult decision over whether or not to take a test to see if she does have the hereditary condition.</p>

      <p>So just what is Huntington’s Disease and what are the symptoms?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>What is Huntington’s Disease?</h3>

      <p>Huntington’s Disease is a hereditary condition which stops parts of the brain from working properly, gradually getting worse over a long period of time.</p>
      <p>The disease normally starts at around 30- 50 years of age, but can begin much earlier or later – and usually proves fatal around 20 years after diagnosis, with sufferers normally needing full-time nursing care in the later stages of the illness.</p>
      <h3>What causes Huntington’s Disease?</h3>
      <p>The condition is caused by a faulty gene that results in parts of the brain gradually becoming damaged.</p>
      <p>It can affect both men and women, but you’re usually only at risk of getting it if one of your parents has or had it.</p>
      <p>If a parent has the Huntington’s gene, their children have a 50 per cent chance of developing the condition, and potentially passing it on to their children too.</p>
      <p>However if a person has not inherited the gene from their parents then they are not at risk of passing it on to their children.</p>
      <p>It’s very rare for someone to develop Huntington’s without there being a history of it in the family – but that could potentially mean that one of their parents is or was a sufferer but has never been diagnosed.</p>

      <p>
        <b>According to the NHS website the early symptoms of the condition can include the following:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Difficulty concentrating and lapses in memory</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Stumbling and clumsiness</li>
        <li>Mood swings and personality changes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these can of course be symptoms of other conditions, but always see your GP if you’re concerned, especially if there is a history of Huntington’s in your family.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Later symptoms of the condition can include:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Involuntary jerking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body</li>
        <li>Difficulty speaking clearly – eventually all communication may become difficult</li>
        <li>Problems swallowing, speaking and breathing – sufferers may choke on food and contract lung infections from food going down the wrong way</li>
        <li>Increasingly slow or rigid movements</li>
        <li>Personality changes</li>
        <li>Breathing problems</li>
        <li>Difficulty moving around – sufferers may eventually lose the ability to walk or sit up by themselves</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There’s currently no cure for Huntington’s Disease, but treatment and support can help alleviate some of the symptoms and problems it causes.</p>
      <p>Medication such as antidepressants and medicines to ease mood swings, irritability and involuntary movements can help relieve some of the symptoms, although they won’t stop or slow down the progress of the condition.</p>
      <p>Those with the condition can also get help and support from occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and dieticians to manage the symptoms.</p>
      <p>It’s also recommended that sufferers stay as active as possible to feel better both physically and mentally, and physiotherapy can help with this.</p>
