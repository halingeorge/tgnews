      <p>A handful of farmers at Machireddypally in Sangareddy district have been forced to work as labourers as crops in their own fields have failed this year.</p>
      <p>On Monday, G. Savithri, a farmer who owns seven acres of land, was seen working as a labourer in one Chechina Bi’s field as cotton sowed in her field has failed to flower.</p>
      <p>“The investment per acre, on an average, is about ₹35,000. The loss incurred by us will be about ₹2.5 lakh and we do not know how to clear our debts. Several others have been facing the same situation,” Ms. Savithri told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <p>“This year, we sowed cotton seeds from the brands like 999, Target, Force, Super and Navamallika and a majority of farmers have already incurred heavy losses. Though we have informed the officials concerned about the same, no action has been taken so far. When we approached them, the officials promised us that the company officials would visit the fields to ascertain the reasons for the loss, but no one has visited us till now,” said K. Satyanarayana, a farmer from Machireddypally.</p>
      <p>For several farmers at the village, this is the third consecutive year that they are incurring losses in cotton cultivation.</p>
      <p>“In 2017, the crop got damaged owing to heavy rains followed by insufficient rains in 2018 that led to losses. This year, it is spurious seeds. Some of us have not yet paid the land lease and we do not how much the landlords will demand now,” said Azeez, another farmer from the village.</p>
