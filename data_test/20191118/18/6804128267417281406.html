      <h1>Denis Zakaria's agent makes transfer admission amid Liverpool, Man United and Arsenal interest</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United have all been linked with the defensive midfielder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Connor O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>The agent of Denis Zakaria has revealed that his client will not be leaving Borussia Monchengladbach in January.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United have all been linked with the defensive midfielder, who has impressed in the Bundesliga so far this season.</p>
      <p>While reports also began to surface from Germany over the past couple of weeks claiming that contact has already been made by Liverpool and Arsenal for the 22-year-old.</p>
      <p>But Zakaria's agent, Mathieu Beda, has told the European giants that they will have to wait until at least the summer to secure the services of the Swiss international.</p>
      <p>"Denis will not leave Borussia in the winter, a change is 100 per cent excluded," Beda told German publication <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/">Sport BILD</a> .</p>
      <p>"Denis is in very good shape in Gladbach and has been playing really well for weeks, but he still has more potential and he wants to show that in Gladbach now instead of dealing with a change."</p>
