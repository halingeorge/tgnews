      <h1>2019 MTN 4Syte Music Video Awards: Watch Medikal’s performance with Ghana Jesus, Mmebusem</h1>

      <p>This year’s MTN 4Syte Music Video Awards saw performances from A-list artists such as Sarkodie, Stonebwoy, R2Bees, Shatta Wale and others but one of them that took our breath away was Medikal’s performance.</p>
      <p>He did it in a way I think many will copy in their subsequent performances. He brought sensational Kumawood actor, Mmebusem who now parades himself as ‘Ghana Jesus’ on stage.</p>
      <p>The comic actor who was on stage with the “Omo Ada” hitmaker and their performance on the night left the audience screaming with laughter.</p>
      <p>They had an interaction midway in the performance where Mmebusem pronounced that Medikal used the talent he gave him to save Ghana’s rap music.</p>
