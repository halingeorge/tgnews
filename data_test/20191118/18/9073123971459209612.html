        <b>The Bandage Bazooka has been missing in Fortnite for about a week and a half. When will it be coming back?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The mystery of the Bandage Bazooka in Fortnite is one for the ages. Most of the time, Epic disables an item for a day or two while they work on a fix. Sometimes, the item is only gone for a few hours before it’s back in the game.</p>
      <p>Epic removed the Bandage Bazooka from Fortnite on November 9, citing syncing issues as the reason for its disappearance. To this day, many players still don’t know exactly why Epic removed it in the first place.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Now, almost a week and a half later, we’re still waiting on the Bandage Bazooka to return. Things wouldn’t be so bad if we weren’t longing to finish “The Lowdown” challenges and obtain Toxin skin variant.</p>

      <p>So, when will the Bandage Bazooka return to Fortnite? We wish we knew. As of this writing, the issue is still listed as “Investigating/In Development” on the Fortnite Community Issues Trello board – though it does carry the “important” tag.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Based on this designation, we probably won’t be getting the Bandage Bazooka back this week – which means at least another full week without the item.</p>

      <p>It would make sense for Epic to auto-complete the missing challenges at this point. Most of the dedicated players would have completed it by now if they were able to.</p>

      <p>It’s a bummer that the Bandage Bazooka is out of competitive Fortnite. It provides a decent balance of infinite healing with a cooldown at the cost of two inventory slots. How do you feel about the Bandage Bazooka? Let us know in the comments.</p>
