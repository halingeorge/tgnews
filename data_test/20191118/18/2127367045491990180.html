      <h2>T10 League: Chris Lynn's record innings studded with nine fours and seven maximums helped Maratha Arabians put up 138/2 in their stipulated 10 overs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:25:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:25</time> by <a rel="author">Indo-Asian News Service</a></address>
      <p>Former India batsman Yuvraj Singh on Monday said that<a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-2020-teams-gear-up-for-ipl-auction-release-71-players-2133274"> Kolkata Knight Riders</a>' (KKR) decision to release Australian opening batsman Chris Lynn was a "bad call" and joked that he might drop the Indian Premier League (IPL) team's co-owner Shah Rukh Khan a message on that. Lynn smashed 91 off 30 balls playing for the <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/t10-league-yuvraj-singh-flops-as-andre-russells-heroics-help-northern-warriors-beat-maratha-arabians-2133291">Maratha Arabians</a> in the <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/kevin-koththiigoda-leaves-fans-baffled-with-his-version-of-frog-in-a-blender-action-watch-viral-vide-2134286">Abu Dhabi T10 League</a>, shattering the record for the highest individual score in T10 cricket previously held by England's Alex Hales (87 off 32 balls).<br/><br/>"Chris (Lynn) was outstanding today, unbelievable hits," Yuvraj, who also plays for the Maratha Arabians, told reporters after the game.<br/><br/>"He is someone I have seen in the IPL. He has given some great starts to KKR. I really don't understand why they have not retained him. I think it is a bad call, must send SRK a message on that. Chris was just outstanding today," he added.<br/><br/>Yuvraj also said that he is happy playing leagues outside India and has not yet decided whether he wants to get into coaching IPL teams.<br/><br/>"There are a lot of leagues coming up in the next two to three years, so I am looking forward to playing a few of them. It's good for me that I play for about two or three months, instead of playing the whole year. I am enjoying that for the next few years and then hopefully can get into coaching after practicing that side by side," he said.<br/><br/>The 37-year-old, who announced his retirement from international cricket before the 2019 World Cup, said that he trains hard to remain fit.<br/><br/>"I had a back spasm today so I can't really fight my body too much. I think mentally I am still young, but the body says take it easy, so hopefully I'll be fit for the next game," he said.</p>
