      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin Department of Revenue Secretary Peter Barca is apologizing for an employee training slide show that joked former Republican Gov. Scott Walker had died.</p>
      <p>Barca sent an email to DOR workers on Oct. 18 apologizing for the slide and calling it an "unacceptable situation."</p>
      <p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported that DOR employee Fred Bahr prepared a slide show for use at an annual retreat for DOR Compliance Bureau employees in October.</p>
      <p>The slide show includes a section entitled "notable deaths" in 2019, including pictures of rocker Eddie Money and author Toni Morrison as well as one of Walker eating a burger while holding a beer.</p>
      <p>Bahr wrote in an Oct. 23 email that he didn't mean any offense. DOR spokeswoman Patty Mayers said that Bahr apparently found the slide funny but DOR officials did not.</p>
