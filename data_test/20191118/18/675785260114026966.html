      <h2>Manchester United legend Giggs leads Wales against Hungary in their final Euro 2020 qualifier knowing victory will clinch a spot at next summer's finals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:55:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ryan-giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> leads Wales into Tuesday's decisive Euro 2020 qualifier after an inspirational message from Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Wales boss Giggs is putting the final touches to the hosts' preparations to face Hungary in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> after they beat Azerbaijan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Victory will clinch second place in Group E and book automatic qualification behind first-placed Croatia.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend Giggs, 45, admitted his former mentor Sir Alex has been in touch.</p>
      <p>Giggs, in his first managerial post since taking charge in January 2018, revealed: “He wished me good luck the other day for the game, which he always does.</p>

      <p>“It is an exciting challenge. It is in our hands.</p>
      <p>“We have put ourselves in a great position but that is all we are in, a position, we still have one game to go.</p>
      <p>“There's a really good atmosphere at the moment and we're in good form.</p>
      <p>“But it doesn't count for anything if we don't finish the job off."</p>
      <p>Tuesday's match at a packed Cardiff City Stadium will be the biggest international for many of the side's starlets like 19-year-old Ethan Ampadu plus Daniel James and Harry Wilson, who are both 22.</p>
      <p>But Giggs broke into United's team as a teenager in 1991 and says his kids are scared of nothing.</p>

      <p>Giggs, whose side are unbeaten in five games, added: “What I've seen in the young players is coming in and being fearless.</p>
      <p>“I got given a chance as a young player.</p>
      <p>“I believe if you give young players a chance , if you believe in their quality, that they won't let you down.</p>
      <p>“Age doesn't really matter to me, it is the quality you have got to show on the pitch and a good attitude.”</p>
      <p>Giggs has Joe Allen back from suspension and the experienced midfielder is likely to go straight back into the team for Joe Morrell.</p>
      <p>But fit-again <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> ace Aaron Ramsey, who came off the bench in Baku, may have to settle for a place as sub again.</p>
      <p>Giggs said: “It will be tough picking the team.</p>
      <p>"The subs as going to be important as well, it is not just about the 11 players.</p>
      <p>“It won't be easy because there are a lot of players who played well the other night.”</p>
