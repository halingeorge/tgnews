      <p>Alan Browne is the surprise inclusion in the Republic of Ireland team to face Denmark tonight. </p>
      <p>Although the Corkman played in the 2-0 loss to Switzerland, his inclusion in the starting team for last Thursday's friendly against New Zealand appeared to rule him out of the running. </p>
      <p>However, the Preston midfielder is included on the right of a 4-5-1, which sees Conor Hourihane return alongside Glenn Whelan and Jeff Hendrick in the centre of the park.</p>
      <p>The other two changes from the Switzerland game see Matt Doherty come in at right-back and David McGoldrick return up front.</p>
      <p>The suspended Seamus Coleman, the injured Aaron Connolly, and James Collins are the three to drop out of the team.</p>
      <p>Shane Duffy will captain the team in Coleman's absence.</p>
      <p>Ireland need a win to seal their place at Euro 2020, although they are guaranteed a play-off should they fail to do so.</p>
