      <p><b>Joel McHale</b> (<i>The Soup</i>, <i>Community</i>) and <b>Thomas Lennon</b> (<i>Reno 911</i>, <i>17 Again</i>) have joined the cast of <b><i>Treat Street</i></b>, from writer and director <b>Stimson Snead</b>. The film’s description reads:</p>
      <blockquote>The plot centers on a group of kids out trick-or-treating who run into the most evil thing imaginable: teenagers. The teens steal their candy and the precocious protagonists must rally the neighborhood (including their parents) to get their haul back and save Halloween.</blockquote>
      <p>This sounds like a silly and fun Halloween movie that families can enjoy. Both actors are hilarious and should bring a funny element to the film for parents to enjoy. The film is set to shoot in the spring in Spokane, Washington, and hopefully we will get to enjoy it next Halloween. Are you down for another spooky family classic?</p>
