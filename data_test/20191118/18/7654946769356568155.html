      <h1>Marvel threatens Democrat Ben Kallos for assuming ‘Captain America’ persona in campaign</h1>

      <p>Marvel Comics has sent an ominous warning to a New York City politician: Stop campaigning as Captain America!</p>
      <p>The campaign of Councilman Ben Kallos, who is running for Manhattan borough president, <a href="https://mailchi.mp/kallos.nyc/he-can-do-this-all-day">sent out a “Superhero Alert”</a> on Friday asking for donations in an a-letter that also featured him dressed as the iconic comic book hero.</p>
      <p>Making matters worse, Kallos stole from Captain America’s trademark phrase, saying “he can do this all day” in the pitch.</p>
      <p>The solicitation makes other superhero references.</p>
      <p>“In all seriousness, while Captain America was pretty busy fighting Hydra, sleeper agents, Loki, Ultron, and Thanos, Ben’s been fighting for everyday New Yorkers,” the Kallos campaign pitch said.</p>
      <p>“But he doesn’t have the Hulk to help him—he has you! And now, Ben’s hoping to continue to fight the good fight as Manhattan Borough President—so before our next big fundraising goal on November 30th, can you make a contribution so our campaign is ready for whatever comes our way?” the campaign pitch asks.</p>
      <p>“And while the real Captain America has super strength, Ben’s power comes from us …And like Captain America, he can do this all day, but we’ve got to make sure he’s got the resources to keep fighting.”</p>

      <p>But Marvel Comics was not amused — firing off a cease and desist letter to Kallos.</p>
      <p>Captain America doesn’t take side in political races, a top lawyer for the comics’ franchise said.</p>
      <p>“I write to request that your campaign refrain from using Marvel’s characters in its advertisements for your quest for the Borough Presidency or otherwise,” Marvel Comic’s deputy chief counsel Eli Bard’s said in a letter to Kallos, which the councilman <a href="https://twitter.com/kallos/status/1195455229870911490">posted on his Twitter</a>. “While Marvel appreciates your obvious affection for our properties and welcome your support as a fan, we ask that our characters not be used for political purposes or to support political campaigns.”</p>
      <p>Kallos was so amused by the letter that he shared it on on twitter.</p>
      <p>“Got this charming letter from @Marvel and got a kick out of it, thought you might, too!,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kallos, who represents Manhattan’s East Side, has long been a superhero fan, <a href="https://benkallos.com/event/avengers-end-game">hosting viewings of movies</a> such as “Avengers: End Game.”</p>
