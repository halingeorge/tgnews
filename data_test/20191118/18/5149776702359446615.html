      <h2>Nottingham Forest latest | Dawson came through the Forest academy and is into the second season of his second spell at the City Ground as he looks to help the Reds achieve promotion</h2>

      <p>Nottingham Forest captain Michael Dawson could be set for a return from injury against Bristol City this weekend.</p>
      <p>The centre-back - who celebrates his 36th birthday today (Monday) and began his career at the City Ground- <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/sabri-lamouchi-reveals-michael-dawson-3520798">has not featured for the Reds</a> since sustaining a calf injury in the 3-2 victory over Stoke City in September.</p>
      <p>Before that, he had played every minute for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> in the Championship this season during an eye-catching start for Sabri Lamouchi's side, losing only one of their opening nine fixtures.</p>
      <p>Despite losing two of the last six in which <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/michael-dawson">Dawson</a> has been missing, only Leeds United have conceded fewer than Forest's 13 goals in the League.</p>
