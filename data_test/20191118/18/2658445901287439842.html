      <p>This was contained in a statement issued by the institution’s ASUU Chairman, Dr Biodun Olaniran, and made available to newsmen in Ibadan.</p>
      <p>Olaniran said that the decision to boycott academic activities was reached after reviewing the situation regarding the non-payment of three months salaries to the lecturers.</p>

      <p>He said that ASUU had earlier issued an ultimatum to the university management to pay the lecturers their outstanding salaries or face industrial action.</p>
      <p>According to the ASUU chairman, apart from boycott of lectures, results of rain semester will be withheld, while the project defence by final year students will be put on hold.</p>
