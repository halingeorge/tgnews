      <p>CLEARWATER, Fla. â€” Parking rates in Clearwater are increasing, the city announced on Monday.</p>

      <p>"Currently, several parking lots across the city have a broad range of parking rates and hours of enforcement. This change will streamline the parking rates and hours of enforcement to be consistent throughout the beach, and it will better align the parking rates with the nationwide industry standard for coastal communities that are similar to Clearwater Beach," the press release says. "In addition, the increase in the parking rates more closely aligns with the city's current beach parking rates in Lot 31 (Pier 60), Lot 32 (420 South Gulfview Blvd.) and the North Beach Parking Plaza (490 Poinsettia Ave)."</p>
      <p>The release says there will also be changes to the parking enforcement hours. Lots will now be enforced from 6 a.m. until 11 p.m., instead of the previous 6 a.m. until 1 a.m. The time limit for on-street parking is also changing from 2-hours to 5.</p>
