      <p>Three Traveller families living in “substandard” mobile homes have taken a legal challenge after three houses intended for them were removed from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Wicklow">Wicklow</a> County Council’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_event=Traveller+Accommodation+Programme">Traveller Accommodation Programme</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=High+Court">High Court</a> case is being taken by the Connors families, who reside at the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Ballinteskin+halting+site">Ballinteskin halting site</a> in Co Wicklow.</p>
      <p>They say they have been living in mobile homes which have outlived their lifespan and claim the council had agreed to build them three houses on a nearby vacant site.</p>
      <p>The proposed houses were excluded from the council’s Traveller Accommodation Programme 2019-2024, adopted by the elected members last September, they claim.</p>
      <p>The exclusion, without any prior notice to them, of the proposal to build three Traveller-specific houses near the halting site was unlawful, they claim.</p>
      <p>The proposal was included in the previous five-year 2014-2019 Traveller Accommodation Programme, they claim.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the families, represented by Eamon Galligan SC, with Proinsias Ó Maolchalain BL, instructed by the Free Legal Advice Centres, sought to have the council’s decision judicially reviewed.</p>
      <h3>Flooding</h3>
      <p>Counsel said the three families, including their children, are living in substandard accommodation prone to flooding and lacking basic amenities, including proper heating.</p>
      <p>The Council has said in separate, but related, proceedings currently before the courts that its decision concerning the Traveller accommodation plan is based on legal advice received regarding a 1996 agreement it made with a resident’s association.</p>
      <p>That agreement provided that the council would not expand the halting site at Ballinteskin, nor develop another one within the vicinity of a nearby Ballinteskin residential caravan park.</p>
      <p>The validity and effect of that 1996 agreement is at issue in the actions by the three families and the other related proceedings.</p>
      <p>Counsel said the applicants say the local authority is not constrained in its duties as a housing authority by the 1996 agreement.</p>
      <p>The proposed three houses would not constitute an expansion of the existing halting site, he said.</p>
      <h3>Quashing</h3>
      <p>In their proceedings against the council, the families seek various orders including quashing the council’s decision to exclude the proposed development from the plan.</p>
      <p>The council, Mr Galligan said, should not have taken the 1996 agreement into consideration when adopting the 2019-2024 Traveller Accommodation Programme.</p>
      <p>The council’s decision to exclude the three houses was in breach of fair procedures and is invalid and of no legal effect, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>It is also claimed it breaches a 2018 circular issued by the Minister for Housing that requires all Traveller accommodation programmes to be prepared in a consultative manner.</p>
      <p>The families further claim breach of their legitimate expectations to be provided with group housing on lands near Ballinteskin Halting Site.</p>
      <p>Mr <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Justice+Charles+Meenan">Justice Charles Meenan</a> granted permission, on an ex-parte basis, to bring the actions and returned the matter to January.</p>
