      <p>Minnesota suffered its first loss of the season Saturday, but bettors have quickly backed the Gophers to bounce back.</p>
      <p>Circa Sports, which has been the first sportsbook to post college football lines all season, opened Minnesota as a 7-point road favorite against Northwestern when lines were released Sunday, and bettors pounced, driving the Gophers up to minus 11 by Sunday night. The number was 12½ at Circa on Monday morning and as high as 13 at other books.</p>
      <p>The Gophers (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten), ranked No. 11 in the newest Associated Press poll, lost and failed to cover as 3-point underdogs Saturday at Iowa, falling 23-19. Northwestern (2-8, 0-7) blew out Massachusetts 45-6 in a game that fell right around the closing number, ending up at minus 38½ at some books and minus 39½ at others.</p>
      <p>Other Week 13 games that moved quickly from the Circa opener by Sunday night:</p>
      <p>— Southern California moved from a 10-point home favorite to minus 13 against UCLA.</p>
      <p>— Oregon State moved from a 15½-point road underdog to plus 12½ at Washington State (12 on Monday).</p>
      <p>— Alabama-Birmingham moved from a 1-point home favorite to minus 4 over Louisiana Tech (5 on Monday).</p>
      <p>— Tennessee moved from a 7-point road underdog to plus 4 at Missouri.</p>
      <p>— The total on East Carolina at Connecticut moved from 62½ to 67.</p>
      <p>As for UNLV, the Rebels opened as 3½-point home underdogs to San Jose State and moved to plus 4½ by Sunday night.</p>
