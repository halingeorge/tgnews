      <h1>US makes Huawei trade extension official</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:16:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#dianagoovaerts" target="_blank">Diana Goovaerts</a></address>
      <p>The US Department of Commerce (DoC) cemented another 90-day reprieve for Huawei, allowing it to continue trading with domestic companies through mid-February.</p>
      <p>Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement the move will enable operators “to continue to service customers in some of the most remote areas of the United States who would otherwise be left in the dark”.</p>
      <p>He added the DoC will continue to “rigorously monitor sensitive technology exports to ensure that our innovations are not harnessed by those who would threaten our national security.”</p>
      <p>The extension marks the third such delay in implementing trade restrictions <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/huawei-lands-on-us-trade-blacklist/">announced in May</a>, which would block Huawei from buying components from US companies. The second reprieve was set to expire Monday (18 November).</p>
      <p>Responding to the action, Huawei stated it: “won’t have a substantial impact on Huawei’s business either way. This decision does not change the fact that Huawei continues to be treated unfairly either.”</p>
      <p>The new extension runs through 16 February 2020.</p>
      <p>Other government agencies continue to move forward with separate blockade efforts. This week the US Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote on a measure which would designate Huawei and fellow Chinese vendor ZTE as national security threats and <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/us-regulator-turns-screw-on-huawei-zte/">ban the use of government funds to buy their equipment</a>.</p>
