      <p>One of the scariest injuries to occur in Week 12 of college football befell Georgia photographer Chamberlain Smith, who was accidentally knocked out while on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, it looks like Smith is going to make a full recovery from the concussion and bruises she received. <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/georgia-bulldogs/photographer-injured-at-georgia-auburn-releases-statement">Smith made that much clear in a tweet</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the University of Georgia provided those concerned with an update on Smith’s recovery.</p>
      <p>Prior to head coach Kirby Smart’s press conference, a Georgia spokesperson said that Smith has returned home to recuperate. Smith is reportedly “anxious to get back to work” as well.</p>
