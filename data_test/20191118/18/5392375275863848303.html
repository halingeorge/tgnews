      <p>Let’s see what it brings to the table in terms of design and hardware.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Design and Hardware</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/347Fpjn"><u>XIDU Tour Pro</u></a> is a thin metallic laptop with a 180 degree convertible hinge and it’s simply 0.62″ thin while its weight scarcely reaches 3.5 pounds. The 12.5″ 2K display features exceptionally meager bezels that take into consideration 88% screen-to-body ratio while the 2K resolution and 10-point touchscreen alongside the full-sized backlit keyboard make it look and act professionally. The huge screen/body ratio and those flimsy bezels offer a vivid visual experience for a wide range of clients. Weight and slimness are great and make it advantageous to carry whenever!</p>
      <p>Proceeding onward to the hardware specs, the XIDU Tour Pro is intriguing both within and outside. The laptop is powered by the eighth Intel Kaby Lake R 3867U 1.8GHz CPU with a top clock speed of 4.0GHz. The CPU is supported by 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 256GB m.2 SATA SSD which can be expanded up to 512GB increasingly through SSD expansion. The ports included are many for a small ultra-book and incorporate 1 x USB Type-C, 1 x USB 3.0, 1 x MicroSD reader, 1 x Headphone jack, and 1 x Charging Port. Obviously, the top element is the 2K resolution on such a small display as most users are used to take a shot at cumbersome laptops with HD or FHD resolution.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Performance-wise, the XIDY Tour Pro is a perfect decision for expending media content (videos/music) and doing office work. The moderately powerful CPU backed with the 8GB of RAM and fast SSD offers smooth performance and stable multitasking experience. For instance; streaming 2K recordings on YouTube while performing different tasks simultaneously was immaculate.</p>
      <p>Proceeding onward to the display, it is gratitude to the 2K resolution and the brilliance is entirely high with the goal that outdoor use is possible. The positioning of the speakers takes into account sound to pump out loud and the full-sized, backlit keyboards is incredible for typing. Furthermore, it is prepared to do some heavy gaming just as 2K video editing, with lower performance than gaming or workstation laptops obviously. In conclusion, the one-touch power button empowers users to power on the notebook while simultaneously performing the fingerprint authentication using Windows Hello platform. The desktop is available in only 7 seconds.</p>

      <p>In the wake of using the XIDU Tour Pro 12.5 2-in-1 consistently for seven days, I found that everything feels very well-designed. The 3.5 pound weight is on the substantial side for a ultraportable, yet the body feels strong, not clumsy and massive. You need just one hand to open the display lid. On numerous laptops, you need two to pry open the stiff hinges. Regardless of whether you’re tapping on the touch screen or on the entirely comfortable touchpad, the laptop reacts right away.</p>
      <p>The screen bounces practically nothing, and the touchpad doesn’t experience the ill effects of the sluggishness or cheap-feeling hinges that are regular on numerous Windows laptops.My personal favorite part about the styling, however, is that everything appears to be flawlessly proportioned. With an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio, an enormous and comfortable touchpad, the XIDU Tour Pro 12.5 2-in-1 doesn’t squander any space. That is as opposed to the Apple MacBook, which is likewise very well-built yet has a lower screen-to-body ratio that outcomes in extra space around the keyboard and display.</p>
