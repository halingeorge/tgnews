      <p>Several MPs on Monday reached <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/parliament">Parliament </a>for the first day of the Winter Session riding bicycles, wearing masks, and in electric vehicles. Air quality in Delhi improved marginally on Monday but remained in the “poor” category for the second consecutive day. Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, who arrived in an electric car, said: “The government is gradually switching to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/electric-cars">electric cars </a>as they are pollution-free. I appeal to people to contribute to fight pollution — start using public transport, electric vehicles, etc.”</p>
