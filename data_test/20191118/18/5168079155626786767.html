      <p>In South Al Sharqiyah, you can find what is perhaps your ideal weekend getaway. Jalan Bani Bu Ali, located in the South Sharqiyah Governorate, is about 300km away from Muscat and has many tourist areas and archaeological sites. “Jalan Bani Bu Ali is a town steeped in history with old watchtowers, an old fort and ornate carved wooden doors at every turn,” says Oman’s Ministry of Tourism. “However, it is most famous for the souq, which is open every Friday morning and sells a variety of modern and traditional goods. “A further 10km south of Jalan Bani Bu Hassan, the town of Jalan Bani Bu Ali is the most interesting in this part of Sharqiyah: staunchly traditional,” added the ministry. “Even now, the town retains a decidedly old-fashioned atmosphere, and visitors remain a source of (usually friendly) curiosity.”<br/><br/>In addition to being a unique geographical setting, what sets this place apart from the rest is that unlike the other tourist spots, the beaches of Sharqiyah South have a calm and mild weather throughout the year, making it a convenient destination for tourists around the year. This little-known tourist gem is unique, compared to other places, as it features its own unique environment and traditions.</p>
