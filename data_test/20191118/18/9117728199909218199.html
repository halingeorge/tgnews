        <b>The whole Formula 1 world applauded <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly's</a> second-place finish at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/Brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a> and the Frenchman has been singled out for some praise by former World Champion, Nico Rosberg.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a topsy-turvey race at Interlagos, Gasly stood next to his former teammate on the podium after wild celebrations in and out of the cockpit. The Frenchman benefitted from<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton"> Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon's</a> collision on the penultimate lap to help him take his first podium after holding off the World Champion on the line.</p>
      <p>It has been a tough season for Gasly who was dropped by <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> after just half a season. He'll race again next season with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a>. Rosberg believes it was a great result for someone who has had a rough season.</p>
      <p><i>"Gasly, I think we’ll all agree, it’s been such an incredibly tough season for him,"</i> Rosberg said on his YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"It’s horrible to be in the situation he’s been in to get kicked out of the team.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"But to see him coming back, getting this awesome result, his first podium in a Toro Rosso after such a fantastic race. Great job."</i>
