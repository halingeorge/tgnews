        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> was the centre of attention as he rocked a gold crown for his birthday dinner with bestie <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> and their other halves.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The TV host celebrated his birthday – which is today – the best way anyone could, by wearing an inflatable crown and eating endless food with his loved ones.</p>
      <p>Both Ant and Dec took a break from hosting I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! to ring in Ant’s special day at The Crafty Cows Restaurant.</p>
      <p>His girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett, Dec’s wife Ali Astall and baby Isla were there to sing the star an embarrassing ‘Happy Birthday’.</p>
      <p>Ant started the celebrations with a non-alcoholic drink while chatting away to his girlfriend and friends.</p>
      <p>The TV host is back on I’m A Celeb after taking a year off.</p>
      <p>He pulled out of hosting in 2018 after he stepped away following a drink driving conviction and battles with alcohol and prescription drugs.</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec’s Instagram page shared a picture of a chocolate cake that was cut into Ant’s name.</p>

      <p>The cake was sprinkled with M&amp;M’s as well as M&amp;M chocolate bars because why not.</p>
      <p>Holly Willoughby, who replaced the host last year, wished him a ‘Happy birthday’ underneath the post and added several love hearts.</p>
      <p>Dragon’s Den investor Peter Jones and Irish actress Laura Whitmore also wished the host well on his big day.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, fans have been absolutely loving Ant rejoining Dec as host of the new series of the series but they’re already missing Holly.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/fans-loving-ant-mcpartlin-back-im-celebrity-miss-holly-willoughby-11172667/">Fans were happy Ant was back by Dec’s side in the jungle</a>, but social media was divided as Holly proved to be popular the year before.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote on Twitter: ‘So happy to see @antanddec back together again for @imacelebrity but I do miss @hollywills.’</p>
      <p>And another tweeted: ‘I miss Holly Willoughby already, not gonna lie.’</p>
      <p>While one mother wrote: ‘My little boy has just said the jungle is strange without Holly, he loved you last year.’</p>
      <p>Not even one ad break in, however, and people began rushing to Ant’s defence.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: ‘So glad Ant is reunited with Dec on I’m A Celebrity there (sic) a great pair together. [I] mean @hollywills done a great job last year but it’s always great when them two are together.’</p>
