      <h1>For Sama Is an Unflinching Look at the Uniquely Female Cost of War</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:26:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:26</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Roy</a></address>
      <p>In one of the most heart-stopping moments of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/for-sama/"><i>For Sama</i></a>, a new feature-length documentary about the human cost of the Syrian uprising, doctors in a makeshift hospital in war-torn Aleppo attempt to save the life of a woman who's nine months pregnant. She's unconscious from wounds she sustained during shelling on the city, and the doctors are forced to do an emergency C-section. The baby boy emerges blue and not breathing, and for several moments, as doctors shake him upside down and assertively pat his tiny back, it's unclear whether he's alive or dead. After what feels like an eternity, he finally starts to cry. Both mother and baby will live.</p>
      <p>This incredible footage was captured by Waad Al-Kateab, a student at the University of Aleppo who was just 18 when the uprisings against Syria's brutal Assad regime began in the summer of 2011. For five years, Al-Kateab filmed her life in Aleppo. She married her best friend Hamza, a medical student, and gave birth to their daughter Sama (<i>sky</i> in Arabic), all while attempting to survive the Syrian army's relentless onslaught against its citizens. The documentary, stitched together as a tender visual letter to Sama, captures what films about war so often miss: how uniquely devastating conflict is for women and children. Here, Al-Kateab talks to ELLE about <i>For Sama</i>, which <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/for-sama/">premieres</a> on PBS Frontline November 19 and will be available to stream the same day on YouTube.</p>
      <h3>On how being a woman granted her access to intimate details male filmmakers might miss:</h3>
      <p>During the process of filming, I felt I had many things I can show better than other people—for example, the experience of being a mother in this situation. It’s really different from [how it affects my husband] Hamza and other men, and I could see that during our relationship together. It was so clear that in many, many places I preferred to speak aloud about my fears. Being a woman I felt, <i>I want to speak about this, I don't want to ignore my feelings</i>. I felt that I needed to say a lot of things even if I hated to hear them, and to be as honest in the film as I can. Other women in the city, when I was filming when I was pregnant, or [when] I had Sama with me, they would walk over and speak with me about their fears and their experience. They would never do this for anyone who has a camera as a man.</p>
      <p>Being a woman in that situation gives me access to many, many things, and at the same time, it gives me no access to many things. But being myself, as this headstrong woman, I felt that I could do [and film] whatever I want.</p>

      <h3>On how her decision to document what was happening to her family influenced other women in Aleppo:</h3>
      <p>In one way or another, you encourage [women through these interviews] to be stronger. After just one of these conversations, I have seen many people, women especially, start to do things they were too scared to before. Seeing me going out and filming and doing stuff even when I was pregnant or I had Sama really encouraged them to do a lot.</p>
      <h3>On how war affects men and women differently:</h3>
      <p>It’s more about how we deal with this experience. Women don't try to escape from this, while men escape and ignore their feelings. Women want to share it, we want to speak out. Every day I was sure that I would be killed, I was dealing with this head on. Hamza had the same feelings but he was doing the exact opposite.</p>

      <h3>On the struggle to care for a newborn in a war zone:</h3>
      <p>All the small challenges that every woman around the world has when she becomes a young mom were that much harder in that situation. Things like, should I breastfeed Sama? Or should I stop it? How to deal with the food, and all these things, which in normal situations are small, but because of the war it was so much harder.</p>
      <h3>On how Sama is doing now:</h3>
      <p>She is doing very well. She is now four. She speaks a mix between English and Arabic. And she’s trying to adapt to the new life. She's going to the nursery, she has friends. Everything’s been good for her.</p>
