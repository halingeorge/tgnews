      <p>Congress national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Monday said Sharad Pawar met with Sonia Gandhi and briefed her on the political situation in Maharashtra. The Congress leader further said that in a couple of days, the delegation of Congress and NCP will meet in Delhi and discuss the next course of action.</p>
      <blockquote>In a tweet, he said, "Sharad Pawar met the Congress President today and briefed her on the situation in Maharashtra. It was decided that in a day or two, representatives from NCP &amp; Congress will meet in Delhi to discuss the way forward."</blockquote>
      <p>Amid talks of a probable alliance with ideologically contrasting Shiv Sena, Sharad Pawar is holding a meeting with Sonia Gandhi at her New Delhi residence. In the crucial meeting, the heads of two parties are likely to discuss the next course of action in the politically dismembered Maharashtra. </p>

      <h3>Sena-NCP-Congress alliance</h3>
      <p>The political situation in Maharashtra remains in shambles with the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress still ambiguously holding discussions over the formula and the nitty-gritty of a probable alliance. After a bitter fallout with the BJP over rotational CM position, Shiv Sena has turned to ideologically differing NCP-Congress to form a government in the state and reiterated their demand for the Chief Minister post. </p>
      <blockquote>Amid political uncertainties, earlier on Tuesday, NCP patron Sharad Pawar took an astounding U-turn over an alliance with the Shiv Sena, saying, "What talks?"  He added, "BJP-Shiv Sena fought together, we (NCP) and Congress fought together. They have to choose their path and we will do our politics."</blockquote>

      <p>Earlier on Monday, Union Minister Ramdas Athawale <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/athawale-amid-maharashtra-stalemate-told-sanjay-raut-to-compromise.html">said </a>that he was told by Home Minister Amit Shah that the Maharashtra government would be formed soon. Athawale said, "Had a word with Sanjay Raut, and told him to compromise. I have asked him for a 3:2 years (3 for BJP, 2 for Shiv Sena) Chief Minister post. I will have a word with BJP now."</p>
      <p>In Maharashtra, parties have been holding marathon meetings to ponder on the government formation in the state. Maharashtra came under the President's rule after the BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP failed to form a government. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party in the state with 105 seats in 288-member assembly followed by Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44. </p>
