      <p>BANGKOK (Nov 18): Another four Malaysian companies will take part in Asia’s premier defence and homeland security event, the Defence Services Asia (DSA) exhibition in Kuala Lumpur from April 20 to April 23 next year.</p>
      <p>In a statement today, DSA Exhibition and Conference Sdn Bhd said over 1,500 companies from the global defence and security sector representing more than 60 countries are expected to participate in the exhibition.</p>
      <p>"The high-profile showcase of some of the world’s leading-edge technologies, systems, hardware and electronic warfare is expected to draw 50,000 trade visitors from 70 countries across the region.</p>
      <p>“To date, 78 per cent of the space booking at DSA 2020 has been confirmed,” it said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Defence Minister, Mohamad Sabu witnessed the signing of contracts by the four companies on their participation at the Malaysian Pavilion at a defence exhibition - Defence and Security 2019 at IMPACT Exhibition and Convention Centre in Nonthaburi.</p>
      <p>Also present were Malaysian Armed Forces chief Tan Sri Zulkifli Zainal Abidin, DSA Exhibition and Conference Sdn Bhd chairman Tan Sri Asmat Kamaludin and its director Nadzeem Abdul Rahman.</p>

      <p>“The two mega events play a key role as the Asia Pacific Defence and Security hub for business sourcing activities and serve as a pivotal platform, bringing together various major players in the defence and security industry and government agencies for strategic alliances, business collaborations and high-level networking,” it said.</p>
      <p>Since its establishment in 1998, the defence exhibition has evolved to become a crucial event in addressing various security concerns including areas like counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, peacekeeping operations as well as battlefield healthcare and critical assets protection.</p>
