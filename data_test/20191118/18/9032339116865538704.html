      <p>"Legacy. What is a legacy?" an iconic <i>Hamilton</i> song goes. For former First Lady Michelle Obama, it includes wearing a custom Schiaparelli gown to the Smithsonian's American Portrait Gala to honor <i>Hamilton</i> creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>
      <p>Of course, the former FLOTUS is known for achievements beyond her haute couture decisions at fancy events (think her Let's Move initiative during her time at the White House). But a fashion legacy is a legacy nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Her acid-yellow gown featured a sweetheart neckline, crystal spaghetti straps, and an intricate crystal bodice. She elevated the bold look with drop earrings.</p>

      <p>"The inspiration for the shape originally came from the crinoline, which is often found underneath couture gowns, but the real starting point for the overall look was the color," said Creative Director Daniel Roseberry in a statement. "The acidic tone echoes Elsa Schiaparelli's signature shocking pink, and we also felt that it matched the strength and energy of Mrs. Obama. It was such an honor to make this special gown for her."</p>

      <p>Obama attended the gala to present Miranda, who has long had the support of the Obama family for his creative endeavors. In 2009, he performed an early rendition of the opening song to his Tony Awardâ€“winning musical during an event at the White House, at the invitation of the Obamas.</p>
