      <p><i>Tetris Effect</i>’s beloved soundtrack is coming to vinyl, publisher Enhance Games announced today.</p>
      <p>Developed by Enhance Games, Monstars, and Resonair, <i>Tetris Effect</i> was released in November 2018 for PlayStation 4. (It <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/7/23/20704249/tetris-effect-pc-windows-vr-review">was released on PC</a> earlier this year.) To celebrate the one-year anniversary, the publisher is working with Limited Run Games to release two vinyl versions of the game’s soundtrack — and a reissued physical version for PlayStation 4.</p>
      <p>The two-disc release will include 17 tracks from <i>Tetris Effect</i>’s Journey Mode, and includes songs like “Connected (Yours Forever)” and “World of Colors.” This version will cost $34.99 and include a download code for the complete, 40 song soundtrack. Pre-orders begin on Nov. 22 on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/">Limited Run Games website</a>. The second version is $99.99 — the five-LP <i>Tetris Effect</i> Original Soundtrack: Perfect Collection — will include five vinyl discs, each Tetrimino-colored and all 40 songs.</p>
      <p>“This edition features liner notes by the director and composer and is packaged in a special slipcase with foil accents,” according to the news release. Available for preorder on Nov. 22, this edition will also include a download code for the full soundtrack.</p>
      <p>As for the physical re-release of the PlayStation 4 game, it’ll cost $39.99 — with a special $29.99 limited-run launch price. (The publisher didn’t say when this will last until.) The reissued game will include “a reversible special-edition cover with gold foil on the front and a revised design exclusive to Limited Run Games.”</p>
