      <h3>Age of Empires 4 Will Explore DLC and Expansions, Not Microtransactions</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Heidi+Nicholas">Heidi Nicholas</a>, 18 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Age-of-Empires-IV/achievements">Age of Empires IV (Win 10)</a> was officially announced at X019, with a gameplay trailer showing it off in full. We don't yet know if this will be the AoE game to make it to Xbox; we don't even have a release date for it, but what we do know is that the AoE team may already be looking ahead to the game's future content. AoE's Creative Director Adam Isgreen was at X019, and as <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/age-of-empires-4/dlc-expansions">PC Games N</a> noted, he had some comments about the game's future.</p>

      <p>As Isgreen noted, microtransactions aren't really something to worry about with RTS games like the AoE franchise, but it's still nice to hear him say so himself. "The idea of microtransactions in a real-time strategy game isn’t a thing", Isgreen said. What's even better is that he followed up this statement with: "DLC, expansions – all of that is things that we’re going to be exploring for Age 4.” He even said that they "definitely already have ideas in terms of where [they] want to go past Age 4, in terms of expansions".</p>
      <p>It's far too early yet for us to know what direction these might take, but the post-launch content added to AoE games in the past has always been solid. In fact, they've added so many civilisations to AoE II that fans have actually asked them to stop. “Our pro players are even like, please don’t add more civilisations, please do other things". Isgreen further said that AoE IV's future content would be influenced by what the players wanted. "But we want to have those conversations with the community, to figure out what we can add...What are the things they want to see in the game? Things like game modes.” Whilst he said they had ideas, Isgreen also emphasised that “a lot of that is going to be driven by the community and the players, where they want to see the game going”.</p>

      <p>There's definitely a new intensity in focus on the AoE franchise. The Definitive Edition of AoE II launched alongside the announcement of AoE IV, and the developers have been <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39600/age-of-mythology-remake">teasing</a> a possible Age of Mythology announcement. The AoE series have always been popular, and their foray into the world of mythology with Age of Mythology was just as well received. It's been a long time since we've had any hint that there could be developments in that department, but Isgreen has also commented on the possibility. He said that they're thinking about all the possibilities for the game; a reboot, a definitive version, a new direction entirely. Either way, it's good news all round for Age of Empires fans, and we'll be sure to keep you up to date with any developments.<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Upcoming-Release">Upcoming Release<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39745/age-of-empires-4-dlc-microtransactions#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003354200/3354287.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Heidi+Nicholas">Heidi Nicholas<br/></a>Hey, I'm Heidi! I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres — when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
