      <h1>Nick Saban Details Saturday Night Conversation With Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:33:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Shortly after Alabama’s bittersweet win over Mississippi State on Saturday, head coach Nick Saban got on the phone. He wanted to check in on his quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, who had been airlifted to the hospital with a devastating hip injury.</p>
      <p>Alabama’s head coach intended on attempting to cheer up Tagovailoa, who presumably was upset and coming to grips with the fact that he’d suffered a season-ending injury.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa ended up doing the cheering up, though.</p>
      <p>Saban revealed on Monday afternoon that his quarterback was in great spirits just hours after suffering the worst injury of his career.</p>

      <p>Saban revealed that Tagovailoa told him he couldn’t wait to be back with the team and watch this Saturday’s game against Western Carolina.</p>
      <p>“I just can’t wait to get back and see the game on Saturday,” Tagovailoa told Saban.</p>

      <p>It’s not surprising that Tagovailoa was in such good spirits. Few people are probably better suited to deal with something like this than the star Alabama quarterback.</p>

      <p>Alabama announced this afternoon that Tagovailoa had undergone successful hip surgery on Monday morning. He’s expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>“Tua’s prognosis is excellent,” orthopedic surgeon Dr. Lyle Cain announced.</p>
