      <p>If you’re excited about the return of the sci-fi series <b><i>The Expanse </i></b>with its fourth season, Amazon has released a new trailer that you’re going to want to watch! It’s loaded with new footage and additional details on the story. It certainly looks like we are going to get a thrilling and exciting new season!</p>
      <p>The series is based on the novel series by <b>James S.A. Corey</b>, and here are the details that have been released that teases what we can expect:</p>
      <blockquote>The disappearance of rich-girl-turned-political-activist Julie Mao links the lives of Ceres detective Joe Miller (Thomas Jane), accidental ship captain James Holden (Steven Strait) and U.N. politician Chrisjen Avasarala (Shohreh Aghdashloo). Amidst political tension between Earth, Mars and the Belt, they unravel the single greatest conspiracy of all time. <br/><br/>About The Expanse Season 4: Season 4 of The Expanse, its first as a global Amazon Original, begins a new chapter for the series with the crew of the Rocinante on a mission from the U.N. to explore new worlds beyond the Ring Gate. Humanity has been given access to thousands of Earth-like planets which has created a land rush and furthered tensions between the opposing nations of Earth, Mars and the Belt. Ilus is the first of these planets, one rich with natural resources but also marked by the ruins of a long dead alien civilization. While Earthers, Martians and Belters maneuver to colonize Ilus and its natural resources, these early explorers don’t understand this new world and are unaware of the larger dangers that await them.</blockquote>
      <p>It was also confirmed that <i>The Expanse</i> will be getting a fifth season, which is great! <i>The Expanse</i> was developed and scripted by<b> Mark Fergus </b>and <b>Hawk Ostby</b>, and Season 4 will premiere on Amazon on December 13th.</p>
