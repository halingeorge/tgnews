      <p>Reporting back with more gadgets available from the endless depths of the <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/ebay">Ebay</a> marketplace and as usual we will be focusing on the lesser known gadgets out there. First we will take a look at the Xiaomi Youdian Kitty smart lock for your safe travels and then we will circle back to the super cheap M3 fitness smartband. Both of course up for grabs for very favourable prices so maybe one of these will be tempting to get for you, maybe as a early Christmas gift or something.</p>
      <p>First we have for you the Xiaomi Youdian Kitty smart lock with very compact dimensions (33*15*58.8mm) and just 57g of weight. So you can use it for your suitcases, backpacks, gym lockers and many more. The lock in secured by a fingeprint and offers intelligent unlock with fast recognition. You can even store up to 20 fingeprints in the memory, just in case. It’s made from combination of zinc alloy and stainless steel and thanks to the IPX2 certification you don’t have to worry about rust either. Charging is done via micro USB port and one hour of charging can last for a whole year of operation. You have also 4 different colors to choose from and <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/153723176051">the price for one is only €18.79</a>.</p>

      <p>Next on the menu we have the M3 smart bracelet, which at a first glance pretty much resembles the extremely popular Xiaomi Mi Band 4. Same oval shape of the body, but the button is slightly different and not level like the Mi Band. The smartband can offer 0.96-inch color screen, heart rate monitoring sensor, notification support, built-in motion sensor for tracking steps and calories, multiple sports modes, 90 mAh battery capacity promising 5-7 days of endurance or the IPX5 waterproof certification. Available in three different colors and the price is extremely low,<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/383266056314"> mere $4.99 for a piece</a>.</p>
