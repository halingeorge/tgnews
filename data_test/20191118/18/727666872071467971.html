      <h1>Roc Nation: Jay-Z Hasn't Commented On Colin Kaepernick!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:35:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author">illseed</a></address>
      <p>There were rumors, but Roc Nation is refuting them all.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors) </b>Over the weekend, Colin Kaepernick and the NFL had an old fashioned Mexican Stand-Off - with two entities! You know what that is, right?</p>

      <p>Basically, nobody is giving an inch. Kap didn't give them what they demanded and he forced his demands to be met. At the end of the day, about six teams came to see the former football player practice. </p>
      <p>But there was a side conversation...reports immediately came out to say that Jay-Z was "disappointed," "mad" or "pissed" at the man he once supported. But, was Jay-Z really upset? It does seem logical if the early rumors were right: that Jay-Z helped Kap get a tryout from the NFL. However, Roc Nation has shot down the reports that suggest Jay has say anything.</p>
      <p>I am no expert, but it looks like Kap may still have his old skills in place! You think?</p>
      <p>That's that! At the end of the day, this is what happened for fans. Thanks NFL and Kap! </p>

      <p>At least Jay-Z isn't adding more gas to the fire! People are going crazy over this! I really wish they could have made it happen.</p>
