      <p>Two people died in an explosion at one of the chemical reactors of a pharma unit in Jeedimetla industrial area here on Monday afternoon. The victims, Amresh Das, 22, and Hadish Shah, 22, who were reactor operators, resumed duty after lunch at Jeevika Life Science. They were residents of Ramireddy Nagar and natives of Bihar.</p>
      <p>The police said the duo were charred to death and their mortal remains were recovered by the sleuths of Fire Services Department. The bodies were shifted to Gandhi Hospital morgue for autopsy, which would be performed on Tuesday. “Around 15 people were inside the unit when one of the reactors exploded due to high pressure,” Jeedimetla Inspector G. Ramana Reddy said. He said the explosion occurred at around 2.45 p.m. and two fire tenders were rushed to the spot to douse the flames. “The injured were shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment,” he said.</p>
