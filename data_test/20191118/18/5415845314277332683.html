      <h1>Arsenal and Unai Emery: What difference does a month make?</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal have reportedly given Unai Emery a month to save his job. But what difference does a month actually make? What more can be learned that isn’t already known?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:00:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/andrewdowdeswell/" target="_blank">Andrew Dowdeswell</a></address>
      <p>Prior to the international break, <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> fell 2-0 in a convincingly subpar defeat to Leicester City. The result left them eight points behind the top four, nine points behind their direct rivals for a top-four finish, and somewhat stranded after their worst start to the season in 37 years. Stretching back to last season, they now have 24 points from their last 19 games. That is close to relegation standard.</p>

      </p>
      <p>And the results are only part of the problem. What is even more concerning is that during this period of wretched disappointment, the team has rarely deserved anything more. In fact, based on their performances, you could argue they are fortunate to have as many points as they do, however measly that figure is.</p>
      <p>There is little attacking ingenuity and clarity, any identity or tactical philosophy is extremely difficult to decipher, other than being adaptable in any and every situation, so much so that the approach becomes confusing and muddled, and the development of the team has stalled drastically, only a select few individuals playing anywhere close to their potential. All this has led to head coach <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=unai+emery">Unai Emery</a> facing increasing pressure regarding his place at the helm of the club.</p>
      <p>Large swathes of the fanbase are now united in their desire to see the Spaniard sacked, while the body language of the players is starting to suggest that they have lost faith in their coach also. Whereas earlier in the season the questions of improvement were put to Emery, his coaching qualities tasked with turning the team around, now they are put to those above Emery, the demands asking to change the coach, if he cannot change the fortunes.</p>

      <p>But Arsenal have stood firm. Through various media mouthpieces, they espoused their support for Emery, criticised the ‘noise’ coming from the supporters, and stated that they fully believe that Emery is the man for the job, despite admitting things were not going to plan at present.</p>
      <p>Despite this vote of semi-confidence, however, the pressure on Emery is only intensifying and those at the club cannot cover their ears forever. It has been reported this weekend<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-month-save-job-20895792"> that Emery has a month to save his job</a>. A kind of run of fixtures before a horrific festive run offer Emery some light relief and the chance to win some matches, his team desperately in search of some confidence.</p>
      <p>But while being patient with a manager is admirable, you have to question what more a month’s worth of play will provide. It is not as if games against Brighton, Norwich, West Ham and Southampton will tell you much about Emery’s progress as head coach. If Arsenal are to truly stick it out with Emery and back him fully, they must do so over a period of time that actually provides him with the opportunity to display progress, say until the end of the season. Simply adding another month only delays the process of firing him without offering true support either.</p>
      <p>A month makes no difference whatsoever. Arsenal will not learn anything from it, Emery cannot prove or disprove anything that he has not already done so, and the decision is only kicked down the road until it is too late to rectify the negative ramifications. The Gunners should either sack him or back him. Giving another month is neither.</p>
