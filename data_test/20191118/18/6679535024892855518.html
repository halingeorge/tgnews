      <p>A six-year-old boy, who was abducted by a class 10 student at Meerpet on Sunday afternoon, was rescued within four hours by the Rachakonda police.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old kidnapper made the boy sit inside a temple at Almasguda and demanded ₹3 lakh ransom from the boy’s father. “He threatened the father of killing his son if he fails to pay the ransom,” said Commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media here on Monday, he said the juvenile’s location was traced using intelligence collection within four hours of parents approaching the police.</p>
      <p>After nabbing him, he was produced before the juvenile justice board and later sent to a juvenile home at Saidabad, he said.</p>
      <p>According to Mr. Bhagwat, the offence took place at around 2.30 p.m. when the victim was playing with his friend at PSR Colony in Meerpet.</p>
      <p>“After luring the boy to Almasguda, the kidnapper called his father, a techie, demanding ransom to release his son. He also warned the boy’s father not to approach the police,” Mr. Bhagwat.</p>
      <p>Further narrating the bargaining episode, the officer said, the accused was in constant touch with the boy’s father and after bargaining, he agreed for a payment of ₹25,000 in advance so as to not to hurt the boy and the rest ₹2.75 lakh to be paid through cheque.</p>
      <p>“Soon after the father approached us, we tracked the calls and apprehended him from Almasguda at around 7 p.m. and rescued the boy,” Mr. Bhagwat said, adding that the accused wanted money for his personal needs.</p>
