      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- South Korean activists called for the resumption of tourism to Mount Kumgang on Monday, urging their government to permit travel to <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/North_Korea/?tps=1">North Korea</a> "without conditions."</p>
      <p>Activists of the Citizens' Movement for the Resumption of Tourism to Mount Kumgang said the resumption should take place "immediately" along with a return to regular operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a jointly operated factory park in the North, Seoul Pyongyang News reported.</p>
      <p>On Monday the group adopted a resolution in favor of tourism to North Korea.</p>
      <p>"We hope North Korea will open the door to dialogue in response to a [South Korean] government declaration to resume inter-Korea cooperation projects without conditions," the group said. "The spirit of implementing the [Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018], with mutual respect is more urgent than ever."</p>
      <p>The group also said the United States and the United Nations should not include Kaesong and Mount Kumgang in the framework of North Korea sanctions.</p>
      <p>The inter-Korea projects pursue peace and reconciliation on the peninsula, the South Korean activists said.</p>
      <p>The group is calling for tourism to resume at a time when North Korea has rejected South Korean offers of talks. In October, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kim_Jong_Un/?tps=1">Kim Jong Un</a> called for the removal of "unpleasant-looking" South Korean facilities from the resort.</p>
      <p>Monday also marked the 21st anniversary of the start of Mount Kumgang tourism, which began after Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju-yung visited the North while herding 500 head of cattle across the heavily militarized border in June 1998.</p>
      <p>That same year, on Nov. 18, 1998, the first South Korean tourists visited the resort in the North. Travel stopped after 2008, when a South Korean woman was fatally shot by North Korean guards.</p>
      <p>News 1 reported Monday South Korea seeks talks as well as solutions. Seoul wants Pyongyang to protect property rights in order for further cooperation to take place, according to the report.</p>
