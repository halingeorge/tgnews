      <p>Of course, for this to work, the app has to be linked to a bank account, credit, or debit card.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/venmo">Venmo</a> can hook up to multiple cards, and this does include some prepaid cards – Venmo accepts prepaid or gift cards from American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa. So, if you have a gift card from any of those brands, you can add them to your account.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/venmo">Venmo’s</a> website <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/235224088-Bank-Accounts-Cards-FAQ">does warn</a> that there are some stipulations on this: “Cards may be declined by the card issuer or Venmo for funds availability or fraud prevention reasons. Also, some payment cards may require a zip code to be linked to your account.” So, if adding a prepaid card doesn’t work, those are probably the reasons why.</p>
      <p>However, in most situations, adding a gift card from any of the brands listed above should be no problem. Here’s how to do it.</p>
