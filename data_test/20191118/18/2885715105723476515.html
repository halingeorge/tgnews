      <p>A 17-year-old boy allegedly committed suicide on Sunday, by hanging himself at his relatives house in Akota area of the city. Vedant Mehta, a native of Mahisagar district, lived with his maternal aunt and uncle in Vadodara. His parents are farmers and live in Lunawada taluka of Mahisagar district.</p>
      <p>Vedant was alone at home at the time of the incident, police said. The reason behind the suicide is not known yet. He was a science student of class 12.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night, his aunt and uncle had gone out for shopping when Vedant had returned home from his classes. Finding no one at home, he allegedly took the extreme step, the police said. When his uncle and aunt returned, they immediately called the ambulance but he was declared dead.</p>
      <p>Police said no suicide note was recovered from the house. “His family claims that he was not tensed about his studies and there were no financial constraints either. We are talking to his friends, teachers and classmates to find out if they knew if something was bothering him, which led him to take the extreme step,” a police official said.</p>
