      <p>Following 18 months of research, Auckland-based not-for-profit Reemi launches their first major project - the world's most innovative period underwear.</p>
      <p>The first-of-its kind underwear can hold up to two tampons worth of blood and is made using a brand new fabric technology called CottonX, a self-disinfecting fibre.</p>
      <p>Environmentally friendly and biodegradable, the fibre fuses 100% natural cotton with copper oxide to provide the ultimate in skin care and protection. Soft even on sensitive skin, it can even help reduce the risk of infections.</p>
      <p>Started by Emily Au Young (non-profit Marketing Manager) and emergency nurse Ashleigh Howan, Reemi was born out of their own frustrations with limited and inadequate products for our menstruation. After a research trip to local groups in Bangladesh, Nepal and India in 2017, they saw firsthand the extent of global poverty and the shocking number of factory workers (73%) who missed an average of six days of work per month (resulting in unpaid days) due to infections caused by unhygienic menstrual cloth or rags.</p>
      <p>In response, Reemi is set to begin their first major project supporting garment workers with their menstruation in Bangladesh at the end of this year.</p>
      <p>A registered charity, they’ve partnered with the best local organisations in Bangladesh to ensure 100% of their profits go towards providing much needed education and menstrual products.<br/>Funds will contribute to a trial in a garment factory in Bangladesh for late this year. This will help with understanding preferred product solutions, and help measure impact over a long period of time.<br/>Products include; wash bags, dry bags (to ensure the product is discreet) and period underwear. Menstrual cups are not culturally appropriate.</p>
      <p>Reemi launched their Kickstarter with a goal to see people all around the world have access to a convenient, safe, and healthy period; to not be held back.</p>
      <p>Good for you, good for the earth, good for others.</p>
