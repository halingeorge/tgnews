      <h1>Former friend of ISIS bride Lisa Smith says she should not be allowed 'roam the streets' on her return</h1>
      <h2>Ms Duffy described the former Irish soldier as “arrogant” and “argumentative"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:05:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/jerome-reilly/" target="_blank">Jerome Reilly</a></address>
      <p>ISIS bride <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/lisa-smith">Lisa Smith</a> should not be allowed to “roam the streets” when she returns home because her ideology and contacts make her a threat to this country, a former friend declared on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dundalk">Dundalk</a> native Smith, 38, is expected to be brought back to Ireland with her two-year-old daughter within days.</p>
      <p>But in a damning denunciation Carol Duffy, an Irish Muslim convert, said Smith has not shown any remorse and should not be allowed to live a normal life on her return.</p>
      <p>She said she was apprehensive and fearful about Smith’s repatriation.</p>
      <p>Ms Duffy described the former Irish soldier as “arrogant” and “argumentative.”</p>

      <p>She also claimed the Dundalk woman was desperate to wear the full face veil known as the niqab, not for religious reasons to protect modesty, but because she thought it was sexy.</p>
      <p>“She did think it was sexy. There’s a lot of people that think the niqab would be sexy because you just see the eyes. It’s stupid. It’s a ludicrous thing,” she told Pat Kenny on Newstalk radio.</p>
      <p>Ms Duffy said the Muslim women in her community had been discussing what would happen if Lisa Smith wanted to pray at the mosque.</p>
      <p>“| think we should chuck her out. Legally we could not stop her from praying but we will not allow her to participate in classes in the mosque or community centre. We don’t want that ideology,” she said.</p>

      <p>Ms Duffy of the Dundalk Muslim Community Centre, claimed, that to her knowledge, Smith has been married three times through religious rite and once legally.</p>
      <p>Her first marriage to an Algerian man in Ireland lasted just three months before she demanded “talak’ [divorce]. Another religious marriage to an Iraqi also failed in Turkey before she legally married a Tunisian.</p>
      <p>Ms Duffy admitted that she had initially believed Smith had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time and found herself in Syria through bad luck.</p>
      <p>Now she believes it was all planned.</p>
      <p>“How would she even get into Syria when it was a war zone. How would a white woman get into Syria from Ireland?” she asked.</p>
      <p>Ms Duffy said that Lisa Smith had to go to Syria with somebody because she wouldn’t have got there on her own.</p>
      <p>“That means this was definitely planned. She would have had to put things in motion to get there. How could she have got over the border? How would she get in there?</p>
      <p>She claimed that Lisa Smith was always radical and was not radicalised when she converted to Islam.</p>
      <p>“The stuff she had been reading was a little bit out there. It was very mixed up. She had very mixed information about Islam and even at that stage she was into politics. She spent an awful lot of time online.”</p>
      <p>“Lisa has been saying that she was just a housewife doing her shopping and visiting friends in Syria. People don’t realise that the friends she was talking to were Sally-Anne Jones (British born terrorist and ISIS recruiter and [her husband] Junaid Hussein [ both killed by US drone strikes in Syria)”.</p>
      <p>“In an interview on June 18th Lisa actually asked: ‘How did we fail?’ Who is the ‘we’ here? My fear is that we don’t know if she still has the connections she had. That ideology is not going to leave her overnight.</p>

      <p>MsDuffy said she was sure more information is going to come out about Lisa Smith.</p>
      <p>“This is not something in isolation. We should be very, very nervous about this because of her connections. No-one took Khalid Kelly seriously (Kelly was a Liberties-born Islamic terrorist who blew himself up in a suicide bombing near Mosul in 2016).</p>
      <p>"They thought he was a nut job. In some interviews they made a joke of him making out he was some sort of clown . Look what he did? “</p>
      <p>“We should be seriously worried about this. She should not be allowed to roam the streets. She rejected this life, rejected this country” Ms Duffy said.</p>
