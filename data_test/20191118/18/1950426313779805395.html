      <p><i>Joker</i>, which tells the origin story of Batman’s arch nemesis, received widespread acclaim and several awards despite its disturbing undertones and graphic violence, and has grossed over $1 billion at the box office, making it the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time.</p>
      <p>“The senior White House official said Trump liked the film,” Yahoo <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-hosts-white-house-screening-of-joker-162846043.html">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump, a known cinephile, has made several cameo appearances in films like <i>Home Alone 2: Lost In New York</i>, <i>Two Weeks Notice</i>, and <i>Ghosts Can’t Do It</i>.</p>
      <p>He even listed a few of his favorites films in a 2013 tweet, including <i>Citizen Kane</i>, <i>Gone With The Wind</i>, and <i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i>.</p>

      <p>Trump’s praise for <i>Joker</i> is notable given its parallels to the current political climate: in the film, billionaire Thomas Wayne decides to run for mayor but is protested by violent Antifa-like crowds wearing clown masks and holding signs that say “Eat The Rich” and “Resist.”</p>
      <p>The mainstream media did their best to hype up the film as a rallying cry for white people to commit violence, but to their disappointment, all the film did was make a lot of money and <a href="https://www.infowars.com/don-jr-endorses-infowars-clown-world-paradigm/">highlight the clown world</a> in which we live.</p>
      <p>Given the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/movies/joker-movie-controversy.html">mainstream media already billed <i>Joker</i> as “what happens when white supremacy is left unchecked”</a>, Trump’s praise for the film will likely make them double down on that ridiculous assertion.</p>
