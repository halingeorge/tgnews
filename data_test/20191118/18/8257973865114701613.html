      <h1>Chick-fil-A to stop funding groups that oppose gay rights</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:40:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Sakelaris</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Restaurant franchise Chick-fil-A announced Monday it will no longer donate money to organizations that oppose same-sex and transgender rights.</p>
      <p>The Georgia-based chain has donated for years to more than 300 charities, but the company said it will narrow the list to <a href="https://thechickenwire.chick-fil-a.com/News/Chick-fil-A-Foundation-Announces-2020-Priorities">three categories</a> -- education, homelessness and hunger.</p>
      <p>Among the groups that will no longer receive support is the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, whose mission statement maintains that marriage is the union of a man and woman. Chick-fil-A had previously given nearly $2 million to the FCA and similar groups.</p>
      <p>The change will begin Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>"There's no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are," Chick-fil-A President Tim Tassopoulos <a href="https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/retail/exclusive-amid-global-expansion-and-lgbt-pushback-chick-fil-a-changes-charitable-giving-structure-101818">told Bisnow.</a> "There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message."</p>
      <p>The restaurant had <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/chick-fil-a-to-end-donations-to-groups-that-oppose-gay-and-transgender-rights">pledged to give</a> about $9 million in 2020 to groups that include Junior Achievement USA and Covenant House International. That amount includes $25,000 to a local food bank each time Chick-fil-A opens a new restaurant.</p>
      <p>"This provides more focus and clarity," Tassopoulos added. "We think [education, hunger and homelessness] are critical issues in communities where we do business."</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy has previously been vocal about his opposition to gay marriage.</p>
