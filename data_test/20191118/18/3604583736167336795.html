      <h1>New homes for tragedy-hit Mount Pleasant road</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jolyon Attwooll</a></address>
      <p>Six new social housing residences are planned at Mount Pleasant sites where a man died at work and a woman was killed in unexplained circumstances.</p>
      <p>The DHHS has recently lodged a planning application for numbers 1 and 2 Kenworthy Place in the suburb in the south-east of Ballarat.</p>
      <p>Number 1 Kenworthy Place was where a Ballarat woman, Dannyll Goodsell, died. Her body was found in her partly burnt home on October 5 last year.</p>
      <p>On October 23, the address was the scene of another fire, which was described as "suspicious".</p>

      <p>Scott Cameron, the former partner of Ms Goodsell, pleaded not guilty to her murder last month.</p>
      <p>The other property listed in planning application was 2 Kenworthy Place, where a construction worker died on September 11 this year.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Horsham man was working alongside one other person to demolish the house when the wall collapsed.</p>

      <p>Both of the existing structures on the sites, which are owned by the DHHS, would be fully knocked down before construction of the new homes begins. There are currently small memorials at the front of both houses.</p>
      <p>Design plans show four one-bedroom single storey units as well as two two bedroom properties.</p>

      <p>The issue of social housing shortage has been a pressing one for the government of Dan Andrews.</p>
      <p>They were criticised last month by the opposition MP Louise Staley who recently highlighted the increasing numbers of people with urgent housing requirements.</p>
      <p>The most recent statistics, published in September, show a total of 1,882 social housing applicants in the area, with 1,106 of those recorded as "priority".</p>

      </p>
      <p>Last month, the state government's Minister for Housing Richard Wynne said there were a range of initiatives to address a shortfall right across the state, including new houses planned for sites in Mount Pleasant and Delacombe.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the 2018 state election, the Andrews government committed to building 800 one and two bedroom properties, and 200 three-bedroom properties, to be completed by 2022.</p>
      <p>Known as the "building new homes to fight homelessness" initiative, Ballarat is one of the focal points of the plan in regional Victoria.</p>

      <p>Other properties are slated to be built in Geelong, as well as the Darebin, Maribyrnong, Stonnington and Whitehorse council areas in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>The government put aside $209 million to build the new homes, which Premier Dan Andrews said would give vulnerable Victorians the chance to build a new life.</p>
