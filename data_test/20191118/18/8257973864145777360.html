      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- The U.S. Army announced it has chosen the Kobra robot made by FLIR Systems Inc. for the heavy version of its Common Robotic System.</p>
      <p>The track-mounted vehicles are used for explosive ordnance disposal and other heavy-lifting duties. <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/11/15/heres-who-just-won-a-contract-to-build-the-armys-heavy-robot/">The contract</a> with FLIR, headquartered in Wilsonville, Ore., is valued at up to $109 million for the five-year production run.</p>
      <p>The Army sought a vehicle that weighs up to 700 pounds to carry a variety of payloads and sensors to support missions. The Kobra can lift <a href="https://www.flir.com/products/kobra/">up to 330 pounds</a>, stretch to nearly 12 feet in height and fold down for storage and transportation.</p>
      <p>The vehicle is part of the ground robotics industry, a category ready to undergo transformation as the Army begins competitions to define its upcoming unmanned ground systems fleet.</p>
      <p>The use of unmanned ground vehicles is necessitated by the dangers of improvised explosive devices and similar threats found on battlefields in Iraq and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/War_in_Afghanistan/?tps=1">Afghanistan</a>. The result was an assortment of about 7,000 UGVs of various design.</p>
      <p>With the FLIR contract, the Army has indicated a preferred model of unmanned ground vehicles, using a small number of common platforms in which parts, sensors and other systems can be replaced easily and maneuvered by a common controller.</p>
