      <p>The age long debate about tithing has taken a dramatic twist after a Ghanaian pastor called Bishop Yaw Adu admonished all Christians never to pay tithes otherwise they will be placed under a curse.</p>
      <p>Yeah, that’s exactly what you read- this proclamation coming from a pastor will greatly surprise a lot of people since they are the ones who wield death threatening quotes to extort money from their followers.</p>
      <p>“Curse is on you those who pay tithe with money. Christians who pay tithe with money have been cursed. It is against the word of God to pay tithe with money”, the head pastor of the New Jerusalem Chapel, clarified.</p>

      <p>Speaking on Kumasi-based Angel FM Bishop J Y Adu supported his stance with Proverbs 3:9-10, cautioning all those who have been using money as tithe to desist or incur the wrath of God</p>
      <p>“Give honour to the Lord with your wealth, and with the first-fruits of all your increase: So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine”.</p>
      <p>According to Bishop J Y Adu “God ordered Jews to pay tithe to him. God told them to pay tithe after their harvest not money”.</p>
      <p>“Though God told Jews to pay tithe but Christians are not part of that covenant. Tithe covenant was between Jews and God”, he explained.</p>
      <p>His statement will surely reverberate within the four walls of Christendom in the days to come.</p>
