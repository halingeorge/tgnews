      <p><b>(CNN) -</b> Actor Nicolas Cage is in final talks with Lionsgate for a new movie project in which Cage would play a fictional version of himself.</p>
      <p>It's called "The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent."</p>
      <p>According to media reports, the script was written without Cage's knowledge by Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten.</p>
      <p>Gormican sent the script with a letter to Cage asking him to join the project and play himself.</p>
      <p>The metadrama will include nods to films Cage has starred in, such as “Leaving Las Vegas,” “Gone in 60 Seconds” and “Face-off.”</p>
      <p>If the deal closes, Cage will also co-produce and Gormican will direct.</p>
