      <p>Founder of Anointed Palace Chapel (APC),<b> Kwaku Agyei Antwi,</b> popularly known as Rev. Obofour has stated categorically that never in his pastoral job will he work for God to take the glory.</p>
      <p>In a viral footage sighted by <a href="http://ghbase.com/">ghbase.com</a>, the <b><a href="http://www.ghbase.com/obofour-episode-4-avram-moshe-gives-a-strict-warning-to-rev-obofour-over-his-new-moniker-iron-boy/">“Iron Boy”</a> Prophet</b> noted that the <b>Ultimate Reality</b> otherwise known as God does not share His glory with anyone, therefore, he’s also following same footprints in his pastoral job.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it’s not clear what resulted in his outburst against God but taking into consideration <b>his demeanour in the viral footage</b>, <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/rev-obofour-reveals-why-he-has-about-11-bodyguards/">Rev. Obofour</a> seems serious with his weird or better still blasphemous proclamation.</p>
