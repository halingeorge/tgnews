      <p>The deal will create the world’s largest deployment of LED screens by pixel density, the firm said.</p>
      <p>It marks an important step forward for the project, which will create a new media hub offering a unique broadcasting environment in the West End.</p>
      <p>Outernet London, located on the corner of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, will boast a 2,000 capacity live music venue, as well as a vast broadcasting display space.</p>
      <p>“We’re delighted that AOTO will be our display manufacturing partner for the London site,” said Outernet chief executive Phillip O’Ferrall.</p>
      <p>“They have vast experience in narrow pixel pitch LED display which will be vital in delivering the highly immersive experience we are going to achieve with our enormous display canvas.”</p>
      <p>He added: “These screens let us create a media environment like no other giving visitors a reason to return again and again and really engage with what they see every time.”</p>
