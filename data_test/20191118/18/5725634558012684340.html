      <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Puxin Limited earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Yunlong Sha</b>
      </p>
      <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
      <p>In the third quarter of 2019, Puxin Limited has achieved overall profitability for the first time. Net income reached RMB33.742 million compared to a net loss of RMB50.219 million. Gross profit margin was 50.3% which has shown a steady increase, potentially making us on track for continued profitability in the future. First, net revenue grew 48.7% year-over-year to RMB996 million beating previous expectation. We have continued implementing our execution and integration growth strategy and successfully acquired eight schools. In addition increasing student enrollment continues to see a key driver for our success. In the third quarter, Puxin student enrollment increased by 50.2% reaching a total number of 871,896 enrollments.</p>
      <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
      <p>As we take a closer look at our business, the K-12 service line performed exceptionally well. Net revenues increased by 86.4% year-over-year. This can be attributable to our acquisition and integration strategy. We have emphasized the acquisition of K-12 focus core as well as excellent organic growth of our existing portfolio.</p>
      <p>On organic growth, our quarterly highlights affirm the improved operational efficiency as Puxin business system continues to expand into lower tier cities. For example, our retention rate reached 70.3% and has exceeded 70% for three consecutive quarters. Such exceptional retention rate has solidified Puxin’s position as a top tier education service provider.</p>
      <p>In particular, the operating profit of K-12 service line excluding financial impact from online school and headquarters increased by 667.1% year-over-year, to over RMB90 million as we continue to scale up.</p>
      <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
      <p>We're also happy to announce Puxin study-abroad business turned profitable for the first time this quarter since the acquisition of Global Education and ZMN Education in the third quarter of 2017. This was another testament to our acquisition and integration strategy. The strategy proved its effectiveness in study-abroad business and led to positive results after eight quarters.</p>
      <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
      <p>Puxin has seen competitive and rapid revenue growth and turned profitable in the third quarter 2019. We're very optimistic about the future as we implement our acquisition and integration strategy and continue to be on solid organic growth.</p>
      <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
      <p>With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Peng, who will go over the financials.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Question-and-Answer Session</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Operator</b>
      </p>
      <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Lee with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mark Lee</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hi, management. Congratulations on the results. May I ask, what is our target for 2020 in terms of the revenue growth for both the K12 and study abroad? And also any margin color? And what will be our focus for M&amp;A? Thanks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Peng Wang</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you Mark for the questions. As to the 2020, we are looking at a high-double digit growth in terms of the top-line growth. And out of which the main driver will be the K-12 segment. And as you may well know that the study abroad segment is growing little slower than the K12. So for 2020, we are in general, we are looking at the high-double digit growth, driven by the K12 both from the acquisition and the organic growth, both together. So as to the margin, as shown in this earnings release, the overall gross margin for Puxin has risen to over 60%. But as a reminder of as a reference, we are looking at plenty of expansion in the high tier cities across China. So, for, in terms of organic growth, we are looking at a higher gross margin rates, but in order to balance the top line and bottom line, we are going to expand our learning centers in the higher tier cities. So gross margin is not the top priority of Puxin. Instead we're looking at a balanced growth with the top line expansion and also the bottom line. Thank you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mark Lee</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks. May I follow-up? So for the organic growth expansion or M&amp;A like any region particularly we would focus more on?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Peng Wang</b>
      </p>
      <p>In terms of organic growth, we are looking at a 30% plus organic growth rate. Mainly by the same store growth. As shown by the second and third quarter results of 2019. Again we are also looking to opportunities in a feasible expansion in the higher tier cities of China. So, of the other growth opportunity in 2020 we are expecting a growth driven by, mainly driven by the organic growth accompanied by expansion feasible expansion of learning centers in the high tier cities.</p>

      <p>Our next question comes from Zhoudon Zhang with CICC. Please go ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Zhoudon Zhang</b>
      </p>
      <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
      <p>So let me firstly translate my questions. So my first question is regarding the study-abroad business. So what's the trends the profitability right now, are we still targeting at increase the profitability of the study-abroad segments? And my second question is regarding the K-12 segments. So what's the general mergers and acquisition environment of this segment? And what's the level of valuation right now is for the segment?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Peng Wang</b>
      </p>
      <p>Okay, thank you for two questions. First, in terms of the growth for study-abroad segments. First of all I like to highlight that our study-abroad segment is growing at the very top in the industry as shown by the result in third quarter of this year. Our segment has grow for globalization, as an example, has grown over 30% and in the past eight quarters with a great reduction in the operating loss of the business, so we are looking at the next to 20% increase in the fourth quarter of this year, which ranks us at the high end of the industry. To the landscape of the M&amp;A firstly, driven by the regulatory movements more and more stakeholders of the state, the small and medium sized o office -- school tutoring companies, they are more ready to cooperate with Puxin.</p>
      <p>And secondly, the valuation is relatively the consideration or valuation is ranked higher, because as Puxin is growing bigger and bigger and pushing the bottom-line Puxin is becoming stronger and stronger. We are looking at relatively bigger and relatively more profitable target in the pipeline. So yes, the reason we are looking at, is raised higher compared with those targets in the pipeline prior to the IPO. But, again, we look rushing for those deals. So we are trying our best to get the reasonable deal.</p>
