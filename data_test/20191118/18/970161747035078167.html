      <p>The Crown has returned to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> for its third season (which incidentally, you can <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/watch-crown-free-netflix-11124702/">view for free for the next month</a>).</p>
      <p>From the Aberfan disaster to the miners’ strike, to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-charles/">Prince Charles</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/crown-season-3-slammed-historian-damaging-portrayal-prince-charles-camilla-relationship-11053061/">‘ love affair with Camilla: </a>the Royal Family had a lot to deal with in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>While it was a difficult time, it sure as hell makes for good viewing.</p>
      <p>The newest series covers the three-day working week in the UK, a government-enforced rule where electricity supplies were only available for three consecutive days per week.</p>
      <p>But when, and why did this initiative come about? Find out here.</p>

      <h3>When was the 3 day week in the UK?</h3>
      <p>The three-day week lasted from 1 January to 6 March 1974.</p>
      <p>During this time, people could only use commercial electricity services on three consecutive days per week.</p>

      <p>It meant that people could not work longer hours, and that television stations stopped broadcasting at 10:30pm.</p>
      <p>Essential services such as hospitals and supermarkets were exempt from the restrictions.</p>

      <h3>Why did the Conservatives introduce the blackouts?</h3>
      <p>The three-day week was introduced following the 1973 oil crisis and was offered as a solution to the dwindling supply of electricity, following industrial action by coal miners.</p>
      <p>At that time, most of the UK electricity was produced by coal burning stations, so the initiative was brought in to conserve the stocks.</p>

      <p>The Conservative PM at the time, Edward Heath, introduced the measures in order to avoid a total shutdown, which would have impacted the currency, rate of inflation, and businesses.</p>
      <p>Labour’s minority government victory in February 1974 brought the miners’ strikes to a halt after negotiating pay.</p>
      <p>Following this, the three-day week came to an end in March 1974.</p>
