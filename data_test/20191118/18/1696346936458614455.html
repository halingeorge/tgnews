      <h1>Mimblewimble Attacked Using $60 Per Week on AWS</h1>

        <b>Ivan Bogatyy of Dragonfly Research says he was able to use as little as $60 per week on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to expose a critical vulnerability on the Mimblewimble (MW) privacy architecture. This flaw in the MW protocol may dent the network’s aspiration of being a viable alternative to other privacy-focused blockchains like ZCash and Monero.</b>

      <h3>Massive Mimblewimble Flaw Uncovered</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/breaking-mimblewimble-privacy-model-84bcd67bfe52">Medium post</a> published on Monday (November 18, 2019), Bogatty revealed that he was able to expose the participating addresses in 96% of Grin transactions on MW. According to Bogatyy, this exploit of the MW protocol only cost $60 per week on AWS — Amazon’s cloud computing platform.</p>

      <p>An excerpt from Bogatyy’s post showing the severity of the problem and the ease with which attackers can exploit vulnerability reads:</p>
      <blockquote>In my attack, I was able to link 96% of all transactions while only connecting to 200 peers out of the total 3000 peers in Grin’s network. But if I wanted to spend a bit more money, I could easily connect to 3000 nodes to disaggregate almost all transactions.</blockquote>
      <p>By “disaggregate,” Bogatyy is referring to the process of preventing transactions from coupling together in MW’s CoinJoin which ensures anonymity.</p>
      <p>While other privacy-focused cryptos use decoy UTXOs or shielded transactions, MW achieves anonymity by means of massive CoinJoins. Each CoinJoin is an amalgamation of multiple transactions in a single block to create the ‘anonymity set.’</p>
      <h3>Still A Viable Alternative to ZEC and XMR?</h3>
      <p>Bogatyy did remark that the vulnerability was known to the MW developers. However, his findings prove that it requires little capital outlay to exploit the weakness in MW’s privacy architecture.</p>
      <p>For Bogatyy, the presence of and ease with which attackers can take advantage of the vulnerability also makes MW a poor alternative to the likes of Zcash (ZEC) and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/monero-reclaim-anonymity-online/">Monero (XMR)</a>. According to Bogatyy:</p>
      <blockquote>The problem is inherent to Mimblewimble, and I don’t believe there’s a way to fix it. This means Mimblewimble should no longer be considered a viable alternative to Zcash or Monero when it comes to privacy.</blockquote>
      <p>The presence of this vulnerability may also affect Litecoin’s proposed MW integration. Back in early 2019, the Litecoin Foundation <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-price-mimblewimble-privacy/">announced</a> that it was looking to incorporate extension blocks on Litecoin to ensure privacy and anonymity.</p>
