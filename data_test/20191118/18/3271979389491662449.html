      <p><b>Nicole Kidman</b> and <b>Margot Robbie</b> are not fighting over the lead role in an upcoming TV series, despite an untrue tabloid report. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can debunk the story. It’s completely made-up.</p>
      <p>According to <i><b>Woman’s Day</b></i>, Robbie was attached to star in the upcoming Australian TV series, <i>Lawyer X</i>, which tells the true story of Nicola Gobbo, a criminal defense attorney who secretly leaked information about her clients to the police. The magazine further contends that Kidman, who co-stars with Robbie in the upcoming movie <i>Bombshell</i>, has stolen the role from her.</p>
      <p>“Margot’s upset,” an alleged source tells the outlet. “It’s been hard sharing the limelight with the Aussie acting queen for the past year, but to have this happen has really put her nose out of joint.” The supposed insider adds, “This is the best role for an Australian actress in decades and Margot thought she had it locked in. Along comes Nicole and Margot’s sidelined.”</p>
      <p>The magazine’s article is total fiction. For starters, there’s no indication that either Kidman or Robbie have been in talks for <i>Lawyer X</i>, which is being produced by the Australian TV company Foxtel. When the project was announced earlier this year, there was online speculation that one of them would be offered the role. Other Aussie actresses, including Naomi Watts and Elizabeth Debicki, had their names thrown around as well. The role hasn’t been cast yet, and both Kidman and Robbie have a number of other projects lined up.</p>
      <p>The idea that Kidman and Robbie are at odds is also ridiculous. The two actresses, along with Charlize Theron, have been promoting <i>Bombshell</i> together for the past month and are continuing to do so. When they appeared on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i> last month, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3nl0I_pANP/">Kidman shared an Instagram photo of her and Robbie</a> backstage, along with the caption, “Backstage with my Aussie girlfriend.”</p>
      <p>There are also several <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/margot-robbie-and-nicole-kidman-attend-elles-26th-annual-news-photo/1181118326">photos of Kidman and Robbie hugging and laughing</a> at <i>Elle</i>’s Women in Hollywood event last month. Shortly after that, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4P74iIp3rm/">Kidman shared an Instagram photo of both Robbie and Theron</a>, and wrote, “Glad to have these two by my side.” The magazine’s feud rumors are baseless. Kidman and Robbie aren’t fighting over a TV series that neither one of them is involved in. <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with a source close to the situation, who tells us the magazine’s report is fabricated.</p>
      <p>This also isn’t the first time a tabloid has attempted to pit the two Aussie stars against each other. Back in January 2018, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted <i>New Idea</i> for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/nicole-kidman-margot-robbie-feud-w-magazine-cover/">Kidman and Robbie were feuding and jealous</a> of each other. In the time since we debunked that article, the two actresses worked together.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting, <i>Woman’s Day</i> came up with various articles linking Robbie to both Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio while they were filming <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>. The happily married actress never dated either of her male co-stars. Now the magazine wants readers to believe she’s fighting with a female co-star. These narratives are as lame and obvious as they are false.</p>
