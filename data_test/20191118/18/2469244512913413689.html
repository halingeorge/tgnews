      <h1>The Apprentice's Lubna Farhan accuses Lottie Lion of 'not learning' from racism scandal as the pair come to blows on Twitter</h1>

      <p>They've not seen eye to eye since day one, but now The Apprentice stars Lubna Farhan and Lottie Lion have clashed again on Twitter, with Lubna accusing Lottie of 'not learning' from racism scandal.</p>
      <p>Lottie, a librarian from Devon was investigated by the BBC a few weeks ago following complains after she told Lubna to 'shut up Ghandi' and threatened to 'f***ing knock her out' in a string of vile messages sent to a Whatsapp group chat between contestants.</p>
      <p>A now, Lubna has hit back at Lottie once more after the pair got vicious online.</p>
      <p>Fellow candidate Ryan-Mark Parsons posted a string of tweets joking about the rumour that he was dating Lottie.</p>

      <p>Lubna, who was eliminated from the show three weeks ago tweeted her fellow candidates saying "Lolzz, you guys are jokers." while Lottie hit back and replied "Stop trying to stay relevant."</p>
      <p>As a result, the  conversation turned nasty, as Lubna then wrote: "You don't sound like someone who regrets making racist comments. Too bad you don't learn from your mistakes.</p>
      <p>"Good Luck in your new publicity stunt."</p>
      <p>In light of the alleged racist incident, the BBC told The Metro: "While this happened on a private messenger service once filming had concluded, the BBC nevertheless still expects the candidates to behave appropriately.</p>
      <p>"The production company have looked into the issue and reported back, Lottie has been informed that her comments were wholly unacceptable and is in no doubt about our view on this."</p>
      <p>Jemelin Artiga was later added to the list of fellow candidates that have spoken out against Lottie, calling her out on Twitter after she was ‘let off’ by bosses.</p>
      <p>Lottie later defended herself claiming the comments were ‘misinterpreted’ and ‘taken out of context’.</p>
