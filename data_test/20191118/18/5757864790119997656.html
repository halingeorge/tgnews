      <p>Possibly because Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, and the rest of the reindeer are pretty busy at this time of year, Kimpton Hotel Monaco in Portland, Oregon, is offering guests the chance to hang out with a few jolly llamas instead.</p>
      <p><i>The Washington Post</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/11/15/therapy-llamas-are-coming-portland-hotel-holidays-because-portland/">reports</a> that the friendly, festively dressed llamas belong to Mountain Peaks Therapy Llamas and Alpacas, which usually brings them to hospitals, rehabilitation centers, senior communities, hospice care, special-needs organizations, and even schools. According to the organization’s <a href="http://rojothellama.com/areas-of-service/therapeutic-visitation/">website</a>, the visits help “alleviate loneliness, lower blood pressure, and reduce stress.”</p>
      <p>And, though the clinical benefits to the Kimpton’s guests haven’t been proven, hotel manager Travis Williams confirms that everyone definitely loves spending time with the quirky quadrupeds. Last year, after overwhelmingly positive reactions to the llama visits, the hotel decided to bring them back.</p>
      <p>“Once we saw the joy that it brought people, we just kept going,” Williams told <i>The Washington Post</i>.</p>
      <p>While it might seem like the use of llamas for therapy is a characteristically Portland-ish idea, it’s not the only place you can find them. <i>The New York Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/well/live/llama-therapy-nursing-homes-elderly-seniors-hospitals-pet-therapy.html">reports</a> that 20 llamas and alpacas are registered with Pet Partners, a national nonprofit organization for therapy animals, and many others are owned and trained by private family farms across the country.</p>
      <p>Jeff and Carol Rutledge, for example, have 13 llamas and alpacas on their property in Stockdale, Texas, outside San Antonio. Three of them are registered therapy <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/animals">animals</a>, having passed a test that includes being touched by strangers and staying unaffected while people argue near them.</p>
      <p>During their visits to assisted living facilities, veterans’ homes, and other events in the area, the Rutledges have observed the animals having a profound effect on residents’ behavior. One man, who is nonverbal and recovering from a motorcycle accident, will murmur as he grooms one of the llamas. And the Rutledges’ high-school-aged daughter, Zoe, even did a science experiment for her 4-H club that showed the residents’ blood pressure is lower after visiting with the llamas.</p>
      <p>While there’s not a very high chance of seeing therapy llamas in airports just yet, you might be lucky enough to see something a little smaller—like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/607840/lilou-airport-therapy-pig">LiLou</a>, San Francisco International Airport’s first therapy pig.</p>
