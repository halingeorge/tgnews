      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:33:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Danya Bazaraa, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/danya-bazaraa/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kate-middleton-duchess-of-cambridge?service=responsive">Kate Middleton</a> arrived at the Royal Variety Performance 2019 wearing a stunning Alexander McQueen gown along with Prince William.</p>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were greeted by two children, one handing over a posy of flowers, as they entered the London Palladium Theatre, where the show is held.</p>
      <p>They went on to meet the cast of Mary Poppins who will be one of the performers. Kate, wearing an exquisite black floor-length gown with a scooped back, appeared to share a joke with the cast members as they shook hands.</p>
      <p>She told the cast she'd had to tell George, Charlotte and Louis "not on a school night" when they'd asked to attend the show.</p>
      <p>As the royal pair entered the theatre, William was seen placing an affectionate hand on Kate's back.</p>
      <p>The annual event is in aid of the Royal Variety Charity, which the Queen is patron of, and this year is hosted by comedians Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan who joked William and Kate were on a 'date night'.</p>

      <p>As she chatted with Petula Clark the Duchess said her children had been really excited about where she and William were going - particularly the dancing and singing - and asked if they could come but she had to tell them "not on a school night".</p>
      <p>Kate was presented with a flowers picked from the garden of the Royal Variety Charity’s residential home in west London, Brinsworth House, when they first entered.</p>
      <p>This year it is called 'Frosty Winter Garden' and was handed to Kate by Lydia Jones, 10.</p>

      <p>Headline act Sir Rod Stewart was unfortunately forced to pull out at the last minute on ‘strict doctor’s orders’ due to a throat infection.</p>
      <p>He tweeted that he was "absolutely devastated" to be unable to perform and described it as an "amazing show which I love being part of".</p>
      <p>"I’m very disappointed that I can’t be there to give my support," he said.</p>

      <p>The Royal Variety Performance takes place every year, either in London or in a theatre around the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Money raised from the show helps hundreds of entertainers in the UK, who need assistance as a result of old age, ill-health or hard times.</p>
      <p>Giles Cooper, Chairman, said: "It's with great pleasure that I announce that this year’s Royal Variety Performance will be held on Monday 18th November, 2019, at the London Palladium Theatre.</p>

      <p>"We’re delighted to be returning to this iconic venue for what we hope will be both a fantastic fundraiser for the Royal Variety Charity and also a very enjoyable and memorable night of entertainment; in the presence of senior members of the Royal Family. The show will then be broadcast throughout the world over the Christmas period."</p>
