      <p>Hulu has good news and bad news for all you “Marvel’s Runaways” fans. The good: The Season 3 trailer finally dropped on Monday. The bad: The video revealed the upcoming episodes, which will be released on Dec. 13, will be the show’s last.</p>
      <p>An individual with knowledge of the streaming service’s decision to end the Marvel series says that creatively, the series had “come to a natural ending point” and that Hulu felt this was “the right way and time” to complete the Runaways’ journey.</p>
      <p>Here’s the official description for the third and final season of “Runaways”: In an action-packed Season 3, the Runaways frantically search for their captured friends Chase, Gert, and Karolina. The kids go head to head with an unstoppable enemy who has targeted Leslie — or more accurately, the child she’s carrying. Nico draws them all into a dark realm where its ruler Morgan le Fay, played by Elizabeth Hurley, is much more nefarious than anyone the kids have yet to face.</p>

      <p>“Runaways” is executive produced by showrunners Schwartz and Savage, along with Jeph Loeb (who, in the coming weeks, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jeph-loeb-to-exit-as-head-of-marvel-television/">will exit</a> as head of Marvel Television.) and Quinton Peeples. “Marvel’s Runaways” is a co-production with ABC Signature Studios, part of Disney Television Studios, Marvel Television and Fake Empire Productions.</p>
      <p>“Runaways” cancellation comes just under a month after fellow <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/cloak-dagger-canceled-by-freeform-after-2-seasons/">Marvel TV series “Cloak &amp; Dagger” got the ax at Freeform</a>, and as Marvel TV is being moved under Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios’ purview, which has left all of Marvel TV’s current projects in limbo.</p>
      <p>Feige, the architect of the hugely-popular Marvel Cinematic Universe, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kevin-feige-marvel-studios-chief-creative-officer/">was put in charge</a> of content creation across all of Marvel’s mediums last week, including publishing and animation. In addition to Marvel TV, Marvel Family Entertainment is also moving under Feige and Marvel Studios, which is under Disney co-chairmen Alan Horn and Alan Bergman.</p>

      <p>Marvel TV currently has six shows in development with Disney-owned Hulu — five animated series and the live-action “Helstrom.” “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” is heading into its final season on ABC next year.</p>
      <p>No decisions have been made on any of these current Marvel TV shows in development. Feige and his team are going to look at all of the projects on a case-by-case basis. Plans for a live-action “Ghost Rider” series that would’ve seen Gabriel Luna reprise his role from “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/marvel-tv-series-ghost-rider-not-moving-forward-at-hulu/">were dropped</a> in September.</p>
