      <p>CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo. (AP) — The Latest on the trial of a Colorado man accused of killing his fiancee (all times local):</p>
      <p>4 p.m.</p>
      <p>A Colorado rancher convicted of murder in the death of his fiancee has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
      <p>Patrick Frazee was sentenced Monday shortly after a jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, solicitation to commit murder and tampering with a deceased human body.</p>
      <p>Since prosecutors didn’t seek the death penalty against him in the death of 29-year-old Kelsey Berreth, the murder conviction carried a mandatory life sentence.</p>
      <p>Before the punishment was formally handed down, Berreth’s family and others impacted by her death told Judge Scott Sells how her death had affected them.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Frazee killed Berreth with a baseball bat while their infant daughter was in a nearby room and then burned her body on his property. Her remains have never been found.</p>

      <p>A jury has convicted a Colorado rancher of beating his fiancée to death while their 1-year-old daughter was in a nearby room and then burning the body.</p>
      <p>Jurors reached the verdict Monday in the case of 33-year-old Patrick Frazee following a three-week trial.</p>
      <p>He was accused of killing 29-year-old Kelsey Berreth with a baseball bat and burning her body on his property.</p>
      <p>Berreth was last seen nearly a year ago on Thanksgiving, but her body hasn’t been found.</p>
      <p>With little physical evidence, prosecutors relied heavily on the testimony of a former Idaho nurse who had an on-and-off relationship with Frazee.</p>
      <p>Krystal Lee testified that Frazee asked her to clean up the scene of the killing and that she watched him burn a plastic tote she believed contained Berreth’s body.</p>
      <p>Frazee’s lawyers questioned Lee’s reliability.</p>

      <p>11:50 a.m.</p>
      <p>A Colorado jury is deliberating the case of a rancher charged with beating his fiancée to death with a baseball bat.</p>
      <p>The Teller County jury is considering the murder case against 33-year-old Patrick Frazee after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and the defense Monday.</p>
      <p>Frazee is charged in the death of 29-year-old Kelsey Berreth, whose disappearance nearly a year ago drew national attention.</p>
      <p>Testimony wrapped up Friday with a jail inmate alleging that Frazee tried to get him to kill the lead witness in the case, a former Idaho nurse who was having an affair with Frazee.</p>
      <p>The defense has questioned her credibility and highlighted the lack of a body, motive and murder weapon.</p>
