      <p>IU spent some time with fans via a V Live broadcast in order to promote her newest album 'Love poem' on November 18th.</p>
      <p>The broadcast, which happened in her band's practice room, was a question and answer session in which IU stated: "<i>I got to show fans an album after a long while. The MV for <b>"Outside of Time"</b> came out and now we're finishing rehearsals. I think this is the most hectic release out of all. I can't really get a grasp of it.</i>" </p>
      <p>IU continued to state: <i>"I was dyeing my hair once a week. For those of you who came to my concert, my hair color changed again. However, my scalp has no issues whatsoever. Usually, when I dye my hair, my scalp never hurts. I have no regrets over my hair so please don't worry about me." </i></p>
