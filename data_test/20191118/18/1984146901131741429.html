      <p>A police officer and his beloved dog have walked the beat together for the final time as they prepare to retire together.</p>
      <p>PC Stewart Paine and his search dog PD Millie have met royalty, war veterans and walked in the footsteps of Olympians.</p>
      <p>Last week, they worked together for the last time paying their respects to the fallen at the Remembrance Day parade in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, nine-year-old Millie will look forward to long walks and cosy nights by the fire as she moves to a farm in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> to enjoy her retirement.</p>

      <p>Stewart, who joined <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">the police</a> in 1996 and will work his final shift on Christmas Eve, said his dog had helped him police a string of high profile events since he got her aged two in November 2012.</p>
      <p>These include <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle’s</a> wedding, the 2012 London Olympic Games, Champions League final in 2017 and Portsmouth D-Day landing anniversary event.</p>
      <p>PC Paine said: “I am so proud of Millie and the work that we have carried out together.</p>
      <p>“We have worked at places some people can only dream of and there’s no other dog I would have wanted by my side than Millie.</p>
      <p>“Working with Millie during my last years in the force has been amazing.</p>
      <p>"She has been a loving companion as well as a hard working police dog.”</p>
      <p>Millie, who is a Cocker Spaniel, worked as a specialist detection dog sniffing out drugs, weapons and cash.</p>
