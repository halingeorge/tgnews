      <h1>Adesanya: Jared Cannonier more dangerous than Yoel Romero, Paulo Costa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:36:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:36</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse Holland</a></address>
      <p>Newly-crowned Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya, has a target on his back after disposing of former division kingpin, Robert Whittaker, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/6/20900795/ufc-243-results-robert-whittaker-israel-adesanya-knockout-middleweight-title-fight-melbourne-mma">at the UFC 243 pay-per-view (PPV) event</a> last month in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>So who will “The Last Sylebender” be most cautious about?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20961468/latest-ufc-rankings-update-zabit-volkov-improve-following-victories-moscow-mma">A quick look at the division rankings</a> — as well as the 185-pound rubble — would suggest hulking bruisers like Yoel Romero or Paulo Costa, but Adesanya insists it’s former heavyweight Jared Cannonier, winner of three straight, all by knockout.</p>
      <p>“100 percent I’m looking at him,” Adesanya told <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/18/20959648/israel-adesanya-wants-to-embarrass-paulo-costa-jared-cannonier-second-most-dangerous-middleweight">MMA Fighting</a>. “He’s a beast in the division. He’s the dark horse in the division. He’s the guy everyone is sleeping on but you can’t sleep on him because you’ll get put to sleep. I think he’s the guy, the second most dangerous guy in the division behind myself. I look forward to fighting him after his next fight.”</p>
      <p>Adesanya was expected to fight Costa at some point in early 2020; however, “The Eraser” was rubbed from the title chase after <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/29/20938610/ufc-dana-white-israel-adesanya-wont-face-injured-paulo-costa-too-soon-jon-jones-super-fight-mma">undergoing bicep surgery</a>. A reluctant UFC President, Dana White, eventually <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20962120/ufc-dana-white-respects-israel-adesanya-desire-face-yoel-romero-will-work-booking-title-fight-mma">gave the green light</a> to a Romero title fight.</p>
      <p>Perhaps that would leave Whittaker <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/14/20964652/darren-till-accepts-callout-agrees-fight-robert-whittaker-ufc-london-mma">to face former welterweight, Darren Till</a>.</p>
      <p>Cannonier (13-4) is likely to have one more fight before earning his crack at the crown. Like Whittaker, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/15/20966790/robert-who-jared-cannonier-ready-fight-darren-till-earn-title-shot-mma">Till remains a viable option</a>, as does the hot-and-cold Kelvin Gastelum. I guess all we can do at this point is wait for pen to hit paper.</p>
