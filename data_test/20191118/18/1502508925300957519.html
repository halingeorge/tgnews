      <p>London: US buyout fund <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/warburg-pincus">Warburg Pincus </a>said on Monday that it had clinched a deal to sell its European <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/airline-services">airline services </a>firm Accelya to rival private equity fund Vista Equity Partners for an undisclosed amount.</p>
      <p>The deal, which was first reported by Reuters, allows <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/warburg-pincus">Warburg Pincus </a>to fully cash out after backing the Barcelona-based company for the past two years.</p>
      <p>The US investment firm launched an auction process during the summer to find a new owner for the business which serves more than 200 airlines including British Airways, Lufthansa and EasyJet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/warburg-pincus">Warburg Pincus </a>bought Accelya from French private equity firm Chequers Capital in 2017 and quickly tripled its revenues by merging it with Mercator, a Dubai-based travel services group in which the U.S. buyout firm had been an investor since 2014.</p>
      <p>Vista Partners, whose portfolio is mostly focused on software companies, was recently vying to buy a majority stake in WPP's data analytics firm Kantar but lost it to Bain Capital.</p>
      <p>Its Chief Executive Robert Smith said Accelya was "at the forefront of innovation and positioned to shape the airline and travel industry for decades to come."</p>
      <p>Accelya employs 2,500 employees across 24 offices in 14 countries and recently signed a long-term deal as the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">International </a>Air Transport Association's (IATA) technology partner.</p>
      <p>Bank of America and Evercore advised Warburg Pincus on the deal while Vista hired Goldman Sachs and Houlihan Lokey to work on the purchase.</p>
      <p>Law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Simpson Thacher served as the legal advisors to Warburg Pincus and Vista, respectively.</p>
