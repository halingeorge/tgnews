      <p>TAMPA, FLA. (WSVN) - Authorities have arrested over 100 people in a human trafficking operation in Central Florida.</p>
      <p>The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office <a href="https://teamhcso.com/News/PressRelease/42016fa4-3c6c-4be7-9f84-2e18ba34ca07/19-399">announced</a> the arrests of 104 suspects after the completion of “Operation Trade Secrets II.”</p>
      <p>Investigators said among those arrested included two men, 36-year-old Jason Fitzgerald and 29-year-old Luis Colon, who met individually with an undercover detective who posed as the stepfather of a 14-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Deputies said the men were under the impression that the undercover detective was selling his daughter for sex, and they arranged a time to meet up with the girl.</p>
      <p>“Fitzgerald and Colon showed up at a trailer park in North Tampa. They began negotiating a price for sex with the child, and when they were told they could take their pick, having sex with a 14-year-old girl or a 13-year-old girl inside one of the trailers, they jumped at the chance to be with the even younger girl,” said Hillsborough sheriff Chad Chronister.</p>
      <p>Fitzgerald and Colon were arrested and charged with human trafficking for commercial sexual activity, traveling to meet a minor to solicit certain illegal acts and unlawful use of a two-way communications device.</p>
