      <h1>Shane Williams urges Wales to cap rising number 10 star before England do</h1>
      <h2>The Cardiff-born 24-year-old has been impressing all season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:20:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Woolford</a></address>
      <p>Shane Williams is urging new Wales coach Wayne Pivac to bring Callum Sheedy into his Six Nations set-up to keep the exciting Bristol Bears No.10 out of the clutches of rivals England and Ireland.</p>
      <p>The Cardiff-born 24-year-old has been a pivotal figure in big-spending Bears' rise to the top of the Gallagher Premiership table this term.</p>
      <p>His form from the kicking tee and overall game management skills means Irish international outside-half Ian Madigan has been playing second fiddle at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>The former Millfield School captain has played 56 games in all for Bristol and scored 294 points in the process since his debut in the 2015-15 British and Irish Cup.</p>
      <p>Despite playing for England in the summer against the Barbarians in a non-capped international, Sheedy remains eligible for Wales through birth and Ireland having an Irish father.</p>

      <p>And Wales' record-breaking try-scorer believes Pivac should make a big play for putting Sheedy into his 2020 Six Nations squad - with Gareth Anscombe out for the season after knee surgery plus question marks surrounding Rhys Patchell following a shoulder operation.</p>
      <p>Shane <a href="https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/">wrote in his Rugby Paper column:</a> "I think he has to be looked at for the Six Nations. He has had an impressive start to the season.</p>
      <p>"You would imagine barring injury Dan Biggar will be the first-choice fly-half for Wales in 2020 and that would be quite right as I thought he had an excellent World Cup.</p>
      <p>"But with Gareth Anscombe a long-term absentee and Rhys Patchell a Six Nations doubt, I'd like to see Sheedy get a first international call up next year. He deserves one in my opinion.</p>
      <p>"For starters, he is being picked at Bristol Bears - who top the Gallagher Premiership after four rounds - ahead of Ian Madigan which tells you everything about how Pat Lam rates him.</p>
      <p>"I've watched him a few times this season and what I like about hias game is his control. I watched Bristol's comeback win at Exeter Chiefs.</p>
      <p>"Sheedy might not have got the headlines, but he was excellent in that game, playing the full 80 minutes and helping his team turn the tables.</p>
      <p>"If he can do that now, I'm excited about what he can achieve in the future at the next level up."</p>

      <p>Sheedy, who came through the Cardiff Blues academy, has previously kept his international options having withdrawn from a Welsh Under-20s squad for a match with France that would have tied him to the red jersey.</p>
      <p>"I think Wales would do well to get him into their international set-up as soon as possible because if he continues his upward curve, the other countries he could represent will surely come sniffing," added Shane.</p>
      <p>"The Six Nations would be the perfect opportunity to give him a first taste of an international environment.</p>
      <p>"No-one is expecting Sheedy to come in and start the tournament ahead of someone like Dan Biggar.</p>
      <p>"As a small nation Wales have to maximise what they can from their playing pool and at 24, Sheedy has all the ability to become a Test player. All he needs first is an opportunity."</p>
