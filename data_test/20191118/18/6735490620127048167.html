      <p>Mötley Crüe is back together – again.</p>
      <p>The hard rock band announced in a statement Monday that Netflix’s recent biopic “The Dirt” inspired bassist Nikki Sixx, drummer Tommy Lee, lead guitarist Mick Mars and lead singer Vince Neil to put their differences aside and head out on tour with Poison and Def Leppard.</p>

      <p>Machine Gun Kelly, who portrayed Tommy Lee in the movie adaptation of “The Dirt”, announced in a video that the band is ripping up their “cessation of touring contract” because the fans demanded a reformation.</p>
      <p>“I never thought I would see the day when this would become a reality,” Kelly says in a press release. “But the fans spoke and Mötley Crüe listened!”</p>
      <p>Before embarking on their 2014-15 Final Tour, the band signed a “cessation of touring agreement,” which they said was a binding document that would prohibit them from ever playing again after the tour ended.</p>

      <p>At that time, Sixx told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/motley-crue-def-leppard-poison-set-2020-stadium-tour-913823/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>, “Legally, we can’t play again… The only loophole is if all four band members agreed to do it, we could override our own contract. But we know that will never happen.”</p>
      <p>The tour will kick-off in 2020.</p>
