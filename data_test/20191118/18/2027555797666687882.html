      <h1>India fastest growing economy among G20: Sitharaman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:44:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/dh-web-desk" target="_blank">DH Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that India's economic growth has decelerated but it is still the fastest-growing among the G20 nations. She also assured that the goal of $5 trillion economy will be achieved by 2025.</p>
      <p>In a question raised by NK Premachandran, an MP from Kerala, Sitharaman replied that though India is seeing a deceleration in growth recently, its economy is being projected as the fastest-growing among G-20 countries in 2019-20.</p>
      <p>"The government has been taking several measures to address moderate levels of fixed investment rate in the economy, plateauing of private consumption rate and modest export performance, with a view to increasing the GDP growth," said Sitharaman. </p>
      <p>Sitharaman also said that the 15 per cent corporate tax rate for new domestic manufacturing companies announced in September was "amongst the lowest in the world".</p>
