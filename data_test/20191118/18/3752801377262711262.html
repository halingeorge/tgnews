      <p>A week after a bus driver was shot and killed in Redcliffe, KwaZulu-Natal, another one was shot and wounded on Sunday evening near Richmond.</p>
      <p>The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) confirmed on Monday that one of its Autopax drivers had been injured in a shooting incident.</p>
      <p>According to the police, an unknown man jumped out of his vehicle, opened fire and wounded the 58-year-old driver on the R56 near the Eston turn-off.</p>
      <p>"The bus driver sustained four gunshot wounds to the chest and was taken to hospital for medical attention," said spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele.</p>
      <p>A case of attempted murder was opened at the Richmond police station.</p>
      <p>Prasa spokesperson Nana Zenani said its protection services would continue to escort Autopax buses following the latest incident.</p>
      <p>Zenani urged anyone with information to call the police.</p>
      <p>Last Tuesday, a man posing as a passenger fired three shots at a bus driver in Redcliffe, KwaZulu-Natal, killing him instantly, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/bus-driver-shot-dead-by-gunman-posing-as-passenger-20191112">News24</a> reported.</p>
