      <p>It’s about that time that people stop questioning Dak Prescott.</p>
      <p>The Dallas Cowboys quarterback put up monster numbers once again on Sunday, throwing for 444 yards and three touchdowns on 29 of 46 attempts in Sunday’s 35-27 road win in Detroit.</p>
      <p>This game marked his third 400-plus pass yard game of the season. Through 10 games, Prescott has four tilts of 375-plus yards and 2-plus TDs. The only other player in NFL history to accomplish that feat in 10 games is Joe Montana in 1990.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys are averaging 444.6 total yards per game, most in franchise history.</p>
      <p>That is a lot of history that Dak is setting, and everyone sees it, including Troy Aikman.</p>
      <p>The hall of famer took to Twitter on Sunday and told the franchise to pay him.</p>

      <p>If he continues on this pace, his number is only set to get bigger and bigger whenever he receives his contract.</p>
