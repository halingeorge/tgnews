      <p>Grown people behaving terribly at sporting events continues to be a yearly thing, and every single incident just makes you shake your head.</p>
      <p>The New York Jets played the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field on Sunday, and it turned into a complete blowout as the road team enjoyed more success in the end zone than the home team.</p>
      <p>At one point during the team, Jets wide receiver Robby Anderson took a Lambo Leap into the crowd after scoring, but when he gave the ball to a young fan, it would be snatched out of that kid’s hands by a grown ass man.</p>

      <p>Anderson was too busy celebrating to notice what had happened to the poor kid.</p>
      <p>It’s no shock the Redskins fan base is upset with their terrible franchise, as displayed by them chanting ‘sell the team’ during the game.</p>

      <p>Still, that was a despicable act by that fan.</p>
