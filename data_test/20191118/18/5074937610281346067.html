      <p>Kpando (V/R), Nov. 18, GNA - The Volta Regional chapter of the Ghana Federation of Disability Organisations (GFD) has elected new regional executives to represent and work for the Federation in the Volta Region.</p>
      <p>The executives who were given the mandate through a popular acclamation at a meeting of the Federation in Kpando, will run affairs of the Federation in the Region for a four-year term.</p>
      <p>They are Mr Elolo Kofi Agyei, President, Mr Francis Foli, Vice President and Madam Meek Delali Ameworlor, Gender Representative of the Federation in the Region.</p>
      <p>Mr Wilson Anku, a former regional executive of the Federation, swearing-in the new executives, tasked them to work hard in the interest of the Federation, and aid its growth.</p>
      <p>Mr Agyei, the newly appointed President, said the major challenge facing the Federation was finance for executives at the regional level.</p>
      <p>He said the Federation in the Region had no office and also lacked facilities to enhance the effectiveness of its work and called for support.</p>
      <p>Mr Agyei said it had come to the notice of the Federation that some districts were not cooperating with some Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in the disbursement of the Disability Common Fund, and pleaded with Municipal and District Assemblies to offer organizational support to various disability groups in organizing their activities.</p>
      <p>He called on government to support the Federation with means of transportation to enable it visit and mobilize its members.</p>
      <p>Mr Agyei advised members of the Federation especially the executives to cooperate with the Assemblies, and offer assistance to one another.</p>
      <p>He also asked members to exhibit good hygienic practices, exhibit confidence wherever they found themselves, and put in their optimum efforts at their various workplaces.</p>
      <p>Mr Alex Korsi Akpo, Volta Region Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the GFD, told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) that issues relating to the Disability Common Fund were a problem for the Federation.</p>
      <p>He explained that a directive was issued for the procurement of investment materials instead of cash remittances for the beneficiaries, and alleged that some Assemblies had misconstrued the directive and were involving third party suppliers, leading to increases in the cost of the items.</p>
      <p>Mr Akpo said the Federation had since been "battling" with the issue, adding that "we know that grants are non-taxable and this Disability grant is not subject to tax”.</p>
      <p>He said subjecting to the procurement process resulted in the imposition of tax and a third party supplier, causing the Disability Fund not to meet its intended purpose.</p>
      <p>Mr Akpo urged Assemblies to form and make use of the Procurement Committee in order to eliminate profiteering third parties and taxes on the items and also cautioned against the introduction of partisan politics in the disbursement of the Fund.</p>
      <p>He called on government to pass a Legislative Instrument (LI) to back the Disability Common Fund to reduce or eliminate the interference of Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs).</p>
