      <p>From the Nakatomi Plaza to the North Pole, from Buddy the Elf to Turbo Man, Christmas movies are an unavoidable festive treat – <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/watching-christmas-movies-is-officially-good-for-you-says-expert/">and they’re actually good for you</a>.</p>

      <p>Talking to <a href="https://doyouremember.com/92889/health-benefits-christmas-movies-year"><i>Do You Remember?</i></a>, a psychologist explained watching Christmas movies triggers the release of dopamine, a feel-good hormone.</p>

      <blockquote>It does create that neurological shift that can produce happiness. I think anything that takes us out of our normal habituation, the normal day in, day out… signals our senses, and then our senses measure if it’s pleasing or not. Christmas decorating will spike dopamine, a feel-good hormone.</blockquote>
      <p>Christmas is the perfect time to be good to yourself – have that extra glass of prosecco, one more slice of cake, one more chocolate off the tree.</p>
