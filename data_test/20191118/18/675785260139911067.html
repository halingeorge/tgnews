      <p>Labour's Ian Lavery said that the "horrific" death of a 65-year-old in a job centre after being declared fit to work showed the "stark reality of Tory Britain".</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old, who has not been named, was sat in the waiting area of Llanelli Job Centre Plus in Carmarthenshire, Wales, when he fell unwell.</p>
      <p>Fellow customers and staff rushed to help him and started CPR but he died at the scene on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>It is believed he was declared fit for work by the job centre earlier this year, and was waiting for an appointment about Jobseeker's Allowance.</p>
      <p>Mr Lavery said:"This horrific incident shows the stark reality of Tory Britain.</p>
      <p>"By forcing unwell people to be ‘fit for work’, the Conservatives have shown they are unfit to govern.</p>
      <p>"The lives and well-being of vulnerable people depend on us removing them from power."</p>
      <p>One witness said: "I didn't know him myself, but the man who was sat next to me told me that he had grown up with the guy.</p>

      <p>"The man next to me told me that the poorly guy had diabetes and had been declared fit for work by the job centre earlier in the year but he was obviously ill.</p>
      <p>"The ambulance came but he sadly died and they had to take his body out of the job centre, it was awful."</p>

      <p>Everyone in the building was asked to leave after the man collapsed.</p>
      <p>It remained closed for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>The witness added: "This lady who worked there walked over to him after she thought he looked quite unwell and that's when they realised he'd collapsed.</p>
      <p>"Another woman and a man helped her put him on the floor and start CPR.</p>
      <p>"We were all very shook up, it was a horrible situation that should have never happened.</p>
