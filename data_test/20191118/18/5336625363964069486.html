      <h1>Dude pranks San Francisco by placing AirPod stickers all over the city</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:03:06+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/nicole-gallucci/" target="_blank">Nicole Gallucci</a></address>
      <p>Every single person who purchases <a href="https://mashable.com/category/airpods/">AirPods</a> does so with the knowledge that the wireless earbuds could get lost at any moment.</p>
      <p>AirPods are small, and are crucially wireless, which means that they have the potential to fall out of an ear or case without their owner realizing. The size also makes it easy for a rogue AirPod to drop into all sorts of hard-to-reach crevices, which could force owners to <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/12/16/apple-airpod-replacement/">invest in pricey replacements</a>.</p>
      <p>Losing an AirPod has become <a href="https://mashable.com/article/airpods-stress-dreams/">quite the source of anxiety</a> among Apple fans, but artist and digital creative <a href="https://twitter.com/PabloRochat">Pablo Rochat</a> decided to have some fun with the common fear by making life-size AirPod stickers to scatter around San Fransisco. Chaotic, right?</p>

      <p>Rochat, who you may recall as the mastermind behind those <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/07/13/instagram-stories-games/">fun Instagram Story games</a>, shared several photos of his AirPods prank on Twitter, along with a video of himself actually adhering one of the AirPod stickers to a post. The stickers look <i>extremely</i> realistic, so they're likely sending AirPods owners who spot them into a panic.</p>
      <p>"I often see people drop their AirPods, so I thought it would be funny to make it look like people are dropping their AirPods all over the city and see if people would try to pick them up," Rochat explained in an email. He's an AirPods owner himself, and while he has yet to lose an earbud he drops them all the time, so he thought this prank would be very relatable.</p>

      <p>So far, Rochat <i>has</i> witnessed a few gullible people fall for the stickers. "That's the best part. I love putting AirPod stickers on the ground and standing back to see people try to pick them up," he said. "Some people are amused by it, but a few have been angry that they were pranked. Joke's on them!"</p>
      <p>If you're in the mood to cause some lighthearted, extremely low-stakes chaos, Rochat tweeted a link to the sticker templates so that you can print your own and place them wherever you please. Not only can you print your own two-dimensional AirPods, but you can print some AirPod Pro lookalikes, too.</p>

      <p>Here's hoping that one day Tim Cook happens upon a loose AirPod sticker on the sidewalk and is forced to do a double-take.</p>
