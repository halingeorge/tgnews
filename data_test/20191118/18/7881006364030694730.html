      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> An avalanche hit Army positions in the Siachen Glacier after which eight personnel are stuck under snow, Army sources said.</p>
      <p>The avalanche had hit the Army positions in the northern glacier at around 3:30 pm today. The altitudes in the northern glacier are around 18,000 feet and above.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Army personnel hit by the avalanche were part of a patrolling party consisting eight persons and were in the northern glacier when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>Sources said that the patrolling party, including porters, were evacuating another person who had fallen sick at his post.</p>
      <p>All possible efforts are being made by the force to recover the troops from under the snow where the temperatures below minus 30 degrees are common during the winters.</p>
      <p>Siachen Glacier is the world's highest battlefield and more troops have been killed in weather and terrain-related incidents in the area than in enemy firing.</p>
      <p>India has deployed troops in its territory since 1984, after Pakistan tried to usurp the glacier by sending its troops and mountaineering expeditions in the area.</p>
