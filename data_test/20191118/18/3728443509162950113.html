      <h1>5 Laundry Tips that will Help You Save Water Everyday</h1>

      <p>India is facing a serious water crisis owing to inadequate rainfall, excessive usage of groundwater and improper water management. As reported in the Composite Water Management Index (CWMI), generated in August 2018, major cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad could reach zero groundwater levels by 2020 and nearly 100 million will be affected by this.</p>
      <p>To ensure that you conserve water and other precious resources, you can start by making small changes. For instance, laundry demands a lot of water, especially if you are using a washing machine. Nevertheless, there are ways by which you can optimise your appliance’s usage and also limit your overall water consumption. Here are 5 changes you can bring to the laundry room.</p>
      <h3>Switch to high-tech washing machines</h3>
      <p>An old and inefficient machine will needlessly require gallons of water for every washing cycle. On the other hand, the latest washing machines like <a href="https://www.bajajfinserv.in/emi-network-lg-washing-machines?utm_source=organic&amp;utm_medium=third-party&amp;utm_campaign=Nov-19"><b>LG Washing Machines</b></a> have features that allow you to optimise water consumption with every load. For instance, eco wash modes that you can use for clothes with slight stains only limit the amount of water usage. Similarly, machines with load-sensing adjust the amount of water per load. Moreover, it is a well-established fact that front load machines consume much less water than their top-load counterparts, making it a winner in the washing machine category.</p>
      <h3>As you go on the hunt for a new machine, here are 3 front load washing machines to consider.</h3>
      <p><b>LG Front Load Fully Automatic Washing Machine: F4J8JSP2S</b><br/>Capacity: 10.5kg<br/>Display: Touch LED<br/>RPM: 1400</p>
      <p><b>Haier Front Load Fully Automatic Washing Machine: HW70-IM12826TNZP</b><br/>Capacity: 7kg<br/>Display: LED<br/>RPM: 1200</p>
      <p><b>Lloyd Front Load Fully Automatic Washing Machine: LWMF 75S</b><br/>Capacity: 7.5kg<br/>Display: LED<br/>RPM: 1200</p>
      <h3>Select a washing machine that has a high energy rating</h3>
      <p>When you switch to a washing machine with a high energy rating, you are assured that the machine will consume as little energy as possible. The stars the washing machine has denotes the energy efficiency of the appliance, so be sure to factor this in when making your purchase.</p>
      <h3>Run your washing machine only for big loads</h3>
      <p>Consolidating washes instead of running the machine for small loads will help reduce water consumption significantly. So, unless it’s a necessity, or you have a machine that can detect the number of garments and thereby adjust the water consumption, avoid running small loads.</p>
      <h3>Use the right amount of detergent</h3>
      <p>When you use detergent without judging the load in the machine, your clothes are likely to have a soapy residue. This may prompt you to initiate an extra rinse to ensure that your clothes are soap-free. To avoid such wastage, use less detergent for moderately stained clothes and more for clothes with heavy stains.</p>
      <h3>Reuse water for more than one wash</h3>
      <p>If a final rinse is necessary and your machine allows you to reuse the water from the previous cycle for the next cycle, do it. This water, which is mostly clean, can be used to soak the next batch of soiled clothes and prepare them for washing.</p>
      <p>By following these tips you will be able to save water, money, and energy. As mentioned, one way to reduce water usage is to choose a high-tech, front load Haier, Lloyd or LG washing machine. While these appliances can be expensive, you can make your purchase pocket-friendly by bringing home a washing machine from the Bajaj Finserv EMI Network.</p>
