      <p>Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, the two co-stars of Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story,” will jointly receive the Outstanding Performers of the Year Award from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the festival announced Monday.</p>
      <p>The actors will be recognized with the honor during a ceremony on Jan. 17 at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara. They join an awards ceremony that is already poised to honor Martin Scorsese and Renée Zellweger.</p>
      <p>“Scarlett and Adam have had such admirable arcs to their careers – making smart choices between independent films and big Hollywood franchises. They both are such lyrical performers, imbuing their acting with keen sensitivity and intellect. Together in Baumbach’s ‘Marriage Story’ they regaled us with their best work to date,” Roger Durling, SBIFF’s executive director, said in a statement.</p>

          <figcaption>This Veterans Day, take a moment to honor someone who took the time out to serve our country in the military. On top of that, you can check out a film or show featuring one of these Hollywood stars who served in the military. Some of the actors on this list have military careers that date back to World War II. While this list excludes celebrity veterans who have died, including people like James Stewart, Elvis Presley and Bea Arthur, there's more than enough patriotism on this list to go around.<br/> <cite>Courtesy Rodney Wright/Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

He was assigned to Weapons Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines. Though he was never deployed, he did get a nickname from his fellow Marines: "Ears Two." He <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/adam-driver-military-nickname">explained</a> to Stephen Colbert that he was one of two guys in his battalion with big ears, but that he avoided most of the verbal ridicule. Driver also told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/09/adam-driver-acting-military-star-wars-the-last-jedi">The Guardian</a> how serving changed his outlook on life. “There’s something about going into the military and having all of your identity and possessions stripped away: that whole clarity of purpose thing. It becomes very clear to you, when you get your freedom back, that there’s stuff you want to do.”<cite>Courtesy Rodney Wright</cite></figcaption>
