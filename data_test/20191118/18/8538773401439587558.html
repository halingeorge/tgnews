      <p>If you're reading this, it's not too late.</p>
      <p>While we'll always have the waiver wire -- and yours truly will continue to write this column until the end of the season -- Wednesday at noon EST marks the trade deadline in fantasy football, at least for those who play with standard settings on ESPN.</p>
      <p>Trades are a fundamental part of fantasy football. They can -- and in many cases do -- benefit the two parties involved. They can be quite the process to negotiate. They create interest among all members of the league. They can impact things short term (re-draft league) and long term (keeper/dynasty leagues). They're fun.</p>
      <p>So with the deadline approaching, make sure you're looking around for a last-minute way to augment your roster. And, if you need some assistance to size up which way you're headed, <a href="http://promo.espn.com/espn/featured/tdameritrade/2019/fantasytrends/index">this handy tool from our friends at TD Ameritrade is quite helpful</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, as for the players who aren't available to trade because they might not even be rostered in your league, here's a look at the ESPN Fantasy Week 12 waiver wire adds.</p>
      <p><b>Note: </b>Players on this column are available in over 50% of leagues on ESPN.com.</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 byes: </b>Cardinals, Chargers, Chiefs, Vikings</p>
      <p><b>Colin Kaepernick note: </b>Kaepernick, who conducted a workout on Saturday, is available in the ESPN player pool and is available for those who would like to add him via waivers, particularly for those who play in dynasty and/or keeper leagues.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126486/deebo-samuel">Deebo Samuel</a>, WR, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> (25.1%): </b>A star has been born in San Francisco, as Samuel has stacked together back-to-back 100-plus yard receiving games, stepping into a shining role while <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13295/emmanuel-sanders">Emmanuel Sanders</a> admirably plays through substantial pain. Samuel has back-to-back games with eight catches and figures to be a top passing-game option for the 49ers going forward.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576623/devante-parker">DeVante Parker</a>, WR, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> (44.7%):</b> What more does Parker have to do to get off this list! Every week he seems to make the column, yet he cannot cross the 50% threshold. He put together his third game in his last five outings with at least 10 targets and has seven straight games with at least 10 fantasy points. Add this man!</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980077/jonathan-williams">Jonathan Williams</a>, RB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> (0.0%):</b> Williams saw some action prior to <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139605/marlon-mack">Marlon Mack</a> suffering a broken hand, but his role really increased following the injury, and he netted 116 rushing yards in a standout effort. With Mack out for Thursday night, per colleague Adam Schefter, Williams looks set to step into the Colts' lead-back role until Mack returns.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold">Sam Darnold</a>, QB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a> (12.4%): </b>Another strong week from Darnold is a precursor to a terrific three-game schedule stretch: the Raiders, Bengals and then Dolphins are on tap for the second-year signal-caller, who is coming off of a 25.4-point effort. There's plenty to like about Darnold's skill set, and he's only going to continue to build his confidence by the week. I project him as a top-15 quarterback for each of the next three weeks, and he should be added for anyone who needs to stream a quarterback because of a bye or a bad matchup.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126367/bo-scarbrough">Bo Scarbrough</a>, RB, Detroit Lions (0.0%):</b> The running back carousel in Detroit spun again in Week 11, as Scarborough scored the team's opening touchdown and handled 14 carries, a team high. He didn't see a single target, which certainly is a mitigating factor in overall value. That being said, he ran effectively, and the Lions have been searching for someone to handle their lead-back roll. He's a non-PPR consideration and a deeper league add too.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3843750/derrius-guice">Derrius Guice</a>, RB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins">Washington Redskins</a> (45.8%): </b>Guice returned to action in Week 11 after missing eight games and provided one of the few offensive sparks the Redskins have had in over a month. He handled seven carries and turned a short pass into a 45-yard catch-and-run touchdown. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10452/adrian-peterson">Adrian Peterson</a> still figures into the mix prominently, but perhaps Guice earns more and more carries as a team that should be focused on the future tries to develop him further.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14053/randall-cobb">Randall Cobb</a>, WR, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> (29.8%):</b> It's three straight games with at least six catches for Cobb, who has also gone over 100 yards in back-to-back games. The Cowboys' passing offense is absolutely incredible these days, with the ability to sustain multiple wideouts in any given week. While Cobb is not a must-start in 10-team leagues, he's a consideration in 12 team or larger leagues that use three receiver spots.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578533/chris-conley">Chris Conley</a>, WR, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> (11.6%): </b>While D.J. Chark remains the man in the Jacksonville receiver group, Conley has become a factor of late. He has four straight games with at least seven targets and double-digit scoring in three of those four. The days of Jacksonville grounding and pounding are behind us, with a high-octane passing offense that gives Conley enough volume as a deeper league flex consideration.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14054/kyle-rudolph">Kyle Rudolph</a>, TE, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> (40.9%):</b> Over the past five games, Rudolph has a total of five touchdowns and at least three catches in each game. Quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins">Kirk Cousins</a> has played rock solid of late, and with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16460/adam-thielen">Adam Thielen</a> out due to a hamstring issue, there's been more work to go around. The Vikes head into a bye this week, but Rudolph is in the weekly starter conversation going forward.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3125404/jacob-hollister">Jacob Hollister</a>, TE, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> (14.2%):</b> With three touchdowns over his past two games, Hollister likely has earned himself a role going forward with Seattle. There is a good chance that Ed Dickson will be activated prior to the team's game in Philadelphia, but I believe that Hollister will have an excellent chance to maintain his presence in the passing game going forward, making him a top 15-ish tight end option.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036131/noah-fant">Noah Fant</a>, TE, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a> (13.7%):</b> The Broncos first-round pick has been busy of late, including a career-high 11 targets in Week 11, plus two carries. He's a factor after the catch and can emerge as a really good red zone target too. Another tight end to consider if you've been juggling options at the position.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574630/jeff-driskel">Jeff Driskel</a>, QB, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</a> (2.3%): </b>Looking for a Week 12 streamer? Driskel should be on your radar, as he is coming off of a stellar 27.5-point effort. Given his athleticism, Driskel can be a consistent threat to run, and the Lions face a poor Redskins team in Week 12.</p>
