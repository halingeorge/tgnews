      <h1>Chick-fil-A slightly less homophobic now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:06:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/xeni_jardin" target="_blank">Xeni Jardin</a></address>
      <p>The popular fried chicken sandwich fast food chain Chick-fil-A has long been targeted by pro-human-rights groups for aligning with hate and homophobia.</p>
      <p>They say they will now focus giving on “education, homelessness &amp; hunger.”</p>
      <p>“Years after splitting from actively anti-LGBTQ orgs, Chick-fil-A will stop funding two huge charities that have also opposed same-sex marriage: The Salvation Army &amp; Fellowship of Christian Athletes,” reports <a href="https://twitter.com/ethan_kraft/status/1196485104329203712">Ethan Kraft at CNBC</a>.</p>

      <p>Excerpt from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/chick-fil-a-drops-donations-to-christian-charities-after-lgbt-protests.html">CNBC's report</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The fast-food chain’s foundation has donated millions of dollars to The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Both organizations have a history of opposing same-sex marriage. <br/><br/>Chick-fil-A said it no longer funds the organizations.<br/><br/>“We made multi-year commitments to both organisations and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018,” a spokeswoman for Chick-fil-A told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding the company would focus its giving on “education, homelessness and hunger.”<br/><br/>The Atlanta-based company has faced criticism in the past for its charitable donations and CEO Dan Cathy’s public comments opposing gay marriage.</blockquote>
