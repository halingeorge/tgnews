      <h1>Jodie Chesney's 'senseless' murder that caused untold agony and dad's marriage breakdown</h1>
      <h2>Peter Chesney has "no idea how I am going to continue with my life" after daughter Jodie, 17, was stabbed to death in a London park when two drug-dealing teens "mistook their target"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:43:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:43</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>He was ready to "take over the world" after landing a promising career as a salesman in the City with his wife and daughters supporting him every step of the way. <br/><br/>But almost a year on, Peter Chesney, 39, sits alone inside a cabin in his garden full of anger and grief as he agonises over how two drug-dealing teens have destroyed his life.</p>
      <p>Not only has he been forced to leave the job which gave him so much excitement, his marriage is in tatters with a divorce looming, his family home has to be sold - and most devastatingly his daughter, Jodie, is dead.</p>
      <p>"I have lost the most precious human being I will ever know," he sobs.</p>
      <p>"I have no idea how I am going to continue with my life or even come to terms with the loss, I guess only time will tell."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The "bright, warm and loving" teenager was fatally stabbed in East London on March 1 - Peter's 39th birthday - and now the "worst day of his life".</p>
      <p>The motive is unknown, but it is believed Jodie's murder was a "planned attack" and the killer pair "mistook their target".</p>
      <p>She collapsed in her boyfriend's arms before taking her last breath and being pronounced dead in the back of an ambulance in the forecourt of an Esso Garage.</p>
      <p>Earlier that day, Peter unknowingly had his last conversation with Jodie when she popped her head around the stairs at home and wished him a happy birthday.</p>
      <p>Jodie, a talented pianist and "proud geek", also apologised that his present would not be arriving until the next day.</p>
      <p>This was the last time Peter saw his daughter alive.</p>
      <p>That evening, as he celebrated his birthday at Dirty Martini in central London with brother, Dave, they received a phone call to say Jodie had been attacked and police were on the way to the cocktail bar to pick them up.</p>

      <p>Peter went "deep into shock".</p>
      <p>One minute he had been laughing and enjoying himself, the next he was trying to absorb the harrowing news.</p>
      <p>But before Peter and his brother reached the hospital, Jodie died.</p>
      <p>She was pronounced dead at 10.26pm at the petrol station forecourt in Illford.</p>
      <p>Peter realised Jodie "had gone" when he heard someone on the police radio saying to reroute to his house as there was no longer any need to go to the hospital.</p>
      <p>The dad dropped to his knees and cried all the way home.</p>
      <p>"There and then - my life fell apart," he told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-50001946">BBC.</a></p>

      <p>"She died, but there was no reason why she died."</p>
      <p>The day - a Friday - had started out like most days.</p>
      <p>Jodie attended Sixth Form, where she was studying A-Levels in Photography, Psychology and Sociology.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, she went home to Dagenham to walk her dog.</p>
      <p>Jodie and boyfriend Eddie Coyle then met up with four of their closest friends at Romford railway station, before heading to St. Neot’s Road play park, known locally as Amy’s Park, in Harold Hill.</p>
      <p>It was while Jodie was sitting on a bench, listening to music and chatting with her pals that Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and Arron Isaacs, 17, crept up behind her in the darkness.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>One of them, believed to be Ong-a-Kwie, pulled out a blade and plunged it into her back, before fleeing.</p>
      <p>A court heard "Jodie screamed until she could scream no more" as boyfriend Eddie, 18, caught her in his arms as she fell off the bench.</p>
      <p>The knife had come millimetres from fully passing through her body, leaving the white lining of her burgundy denim jacket splattered and stained with blood.</p>
      <p>Jodie - who had once visited Downing Street with the Girl Scouts - lost consciousness in front of her horrified friends as paramedics and police raced to the scene.</p>

      <p>Doctors met the ambulance while it was en route to the hospital and performed emergency surgery in an attempt to get Jodie’s heart beating again, but it was in vain.</p>
      <p>Today, Jodie's killers were <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-jodie-chesney-murder-teens-20905559">locked up</a> 26 and 18 years for the "sinister" attack that the judge concluded was not random, but instead a carefully planned "ambush".</p>
      <p>Judge Wendy Joseph QC said it "was part of a series of tit-for-tat attacks increasing in ferocity who have carved up areas of this capital city into turf".</p>
      <p>"Although the target was not Jodie," Judge Joseph added, "there was a degree of planning.</p>

      <p>"I am satisfied both defendants were prepared to carry out their attack.</p>
      <p>"When that knife was driven into Jodie, that intention was to kill."</p>
      <p>Both defendants attempted to shift the blame between them and showed no remorse during the eight week murder trial, which concluded with the sentencing today.</p>
      <p>Dad Peter sat in the court and listened to those involved in his daughter's murder deny any involvement.</p>
      <p>He could not face attending the trial every day or today's sentencing due to the emotional impact.</p>
      <p>However, a victim statement written by Peter was read out at the Old Bailey in his absence. Many could be seen sobbing in the courtroom as they listened.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “The murder of my beloved daughter has destroyed my life and the full extent as to how this has affected my family and me cannot possibly be explained simply in words.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Almost one year ago from the date of this statement I had started an exciting new job as a salesman in the City and I was about to take over the world in a promising career.</p>
      <p>"Now I sit here in the cabin in my garden writing this statement, I have left that job, the relationship with my wife has fallen apart and we are now getting divorced, I must sell my house, and above all, I have lost the most precious human being I will ever know.</p>
      <p>"I still have a fantastic young daughter Lucy and we are leaning on each other throughout this tragedy."</p>
      <p>Peter's wife and Jodie's stepmother Joanne, who was present in the public gallery throughout the trial, also laid bare her agony at how the teen's death has shattered the family.</p>
      <p>"Where do I even begin?" she said.</p>
      <p>"How has losing Jodie affected our lives? Well, I have lost not only my stepdaughter but also my family, my marriage, my dog, my home and at times, my sanity.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I have watched the people I love crumble to pieces. I have watched my best friend change beyond recognition through grief. None of us will ever be the people we were when Jodie was alive."</p>
      <p>She continued: "The thing that bothers me the most is that none of these kids, and they are just kids, care about what they have done to our family. Neither of them cares about what they did to Jodie that night and what they have taken away from us.</p>
      <p>"Neither of them have shown any remorse for what they have done. </p>
      <p>"If only they had known what they were doing that night, what they were taking away from us in that moment of madness. If only they knew the person, they were taking away from the world. Jodie was good, pure and kind in every sense of the word.</p>
      <p>"The night of the 1 March will remain etched in my brain forever. I will never forget the moment I was told those horrible words ‘Jodie’s been stabbed, she's dead’.</p>

      <p>"I will never forget my husband breaking down, blaming himself for not being with her when she took her last breath. Knowing there was absolutely nothing I could do to take that pain away."</p>
      <p>The court also heard how growing up Jodie was "the quietest of our crazy bunch" but as she got older, she got louder and funnier.</p>
      <p>She grew into a beautiful young woman and would leave friends and family in fits of giggles.</p>
      <p>The teen had "everything ahead of her, with so much to give the world" - until she was killed in the split second of violence.</p>
      <p>"She was not in the wrong place at the wrong time, she was simply living her life as a teenager should - carefree and with her friends," said one of the detectives investigating the murder.</p>
      <p>Jodie's cousin Jess added: "How could something so vile and twisted and filled with malice happen to someone so genuinely good? How was she stuck in the middle of someone else’s fight, someone else’s violent vendetta and why?"</p>
      <p>Jodie's sister Lucy also described the turmoil and impact of her loss. </p>

      <p>“I’m only 20 years old and already I’m dreading my life rather than looking forward to it," she said.</p>
      <p>"Losing her is like losing half of myself. We went through everything together and she was always there for me and always putting everyone before herself.</p>
      <p>"She gave me a type of love I will never feel again."</p>
      <p>Terry Chesney - Jodie's uncle - described his niece's murder as "senseless, motiveless, callous, cold and heartless".</p>
      <p>Jodie's other uncle, Dave, conducted her funeral and admitted it was "the hardest thing I have ever had to do".</p>
      <p>"Not just in a professional capacity, but as an uncle who was feeling such pain and grief," he said.</p>
      <p>"In my role, I am used to being close to families in their loss, but I did not for one minute expect that I would have to conduct the funeral of my 17-year-old niece.</p>
      <p>"It has been eight months since Jodie was taken away from us. That’s about 240 days of waking up in the knowledge that we will never see her beautiful face again.</p>
      <p>"That’s 240 days of lives turned upside down because of one stupid, cruel and senseless act of violence. Our lives have been put on hold and for Pete and Lucy, to a certain extent, changed direction entirely.</p>
      <p>"We are a big family, we are a close family, but we remain a broken family which is still coming to terms with the loss of a beautiful soul."</p>
