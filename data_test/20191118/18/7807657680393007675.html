      <p>I used a wooden chair as my office/gaming chair for nearly six years until earlier this year when I <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/easysmx-reclining-memory-foam-gaming-chair-review">reviewed one of EasySMX's gaming chairs</a>. I can't go back to anything less now, and the taste of a proper chair only makes me want something more. This Black Friday, I'll probably take the plunge.</p>
      <p>After doing a bit of my own research and looking around for the best options, I've come to find one I really like. My issue is that it's really, <i>really</i> expensive. The <a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-series?rfsn=1884149.79e6b&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=1884149.79e6b">Secretlab Titan 2020</a> has just about anything you could ever want in a gaming chair (except for a footrest), but it also comes at a steep price tag of regularly $400. My issue right now is that I don't feel cheaper chairs are so much better than my current one that it justifies me spending a couple of hundred dollars. I'm hoping SecretLab offers a deal I can't pass up.</p>
      <blockquote>The Secretlab Titan 2020 has just about anything you could ever want in a gaming chair.</blockquote>
      <p>The Secretlab Titan 2020 has cold-cure memory foam, a pillow with cooling gel, 4D armrests, a multi-tilt mechanism, and built-in adjustable lumbar support. Not a lot of gaming chairs can say the same. That it doesn't have a footrest is one of my biggest complaints, but I do have an ottoman I can use as a substitute. I'll compromise when I need to.</p>
      <p>I'm not here to say you <i>need</i> an expensive gaming chair, but you should have a good one, and Black Friday is one of the best times of the year to do it. As much as I hate the corporate "holiday," I can't always afford to pay full price for things. And if you're going out shopping to brick and mortar retail stores, please be considerate and kind to any workers. I've worked at GameStop on a Black Friday before, and it's not fun, but we did our best with only a month and a half of training.</p>
      <p>If you aren't looking to spend a ton of money, then you do have other options when it comes to gaming chairs. I promise that your back will be thanking you. Mine certainly is. And remember that just because something is expensive doesn't mean it's good.</p>
