      <p>While it hasn’t been the case for <i>every </i>week, it’s starting to feel like we’re getting these software updates at pretty regular intervals. Say hello to iOS 13.2.3.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Apple released iOS 13.2.3 and iPadOS 13.2.3. As the version number will probably tell you right up front, this is a minor software update. As such, it will more than likely not be adding any major forward facing new features to the mix for the end user. However, it will likely continue to patch issues behind-the-scenes and otherwise improve the overall performance of the software.</p>
      <p>iOS 13.2.3 and iPadOS 13.2.3 is available now as a free over-the-air update. If anything new <i>is </i>discovered in this new software, aside from any minor patches and improvements, we will update this post accordingly.</p>
      <p>As far as what’s new, here’s the official changelog, which notes fixes for the Mail app, Messages, fixing background downloads, and more:</p>
      <blockquote>iOS 13.2.3 includes bug fixes and improvements for your iPhone. This update:<br/>   •  Fixes an issue where system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes might not work<br/>   •  Addresses an issue where photos, links, and other attachments might not display in the Messages details view<br/>   •  Fixes an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background<br/>   •  Resolves issues that may prevent Mail from fetching new messages, and fail to include and quote original message content in Exchange accounts</blockquote>
      <p>For those keeping track, this is the second update to iOS 13.2 this month. On November 7, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/07/apple-releases-ios-13-2-2-ipados-13-2-2-with-fix-for-background-refresh-issue/">Apple released</a> iOS 13.2.2 to the public. That update focused on fixing issues with aggressive RAM management and background app refresh. It’s possible that iOS 13.2.3 will do the same, if Apple decided a little more tweaking was needed for users out in the wild.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Apple is already beta testing the next, slightly bigger update to iOS 13. The <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/12/ios-13-3-dev-beta-2/">company seeded</a> the second developer beta of iOS 13.3 last week, along with tvOS 13.3 and watchOS 6.1.1 for good measure.</p>
      <p>So, prime those supported iOS devices. A new software update is here!</p>
