      <p>Hulu has shared an exciting new trailer for Marvel’s<b><i> Runaways</i></b> that is filled with some great new footage of the Runaways teaming up with Cloak and Dagger as they face off with the villainous Morgan le Fay, who is played by <b>Elizabeth Hurley</b>.</p>
      <p>While the trailer should get fans excited for what is to come in Season 3, it was also revealed that this next season will be the show’s last. With all of the recent Marvel show cancellations, I think we all knew that this was coming. I’m actually pretty bummed to hear that <i>Runaways</i> is getting canceled, it was a good show! But, Marvel Studios has got bigger and better plans.</p>
      <p>In the upcoming third season, “the Runaways frantically search for their captured friends Chase, Gert and Karolina. The kids go head to head with an unstoppable enemy who has targeted Leslie — or more accurately, the child she’s carrying. Nico draws them all into a dark realm where its ruler Morgan le Fay, is much more nefarious than anyone the kids have yet to face.”</p>
      <p>The series also stars <b>Rhenzy Feliz, Lyrica Okano, Virginia Gardner, Ariela Barer, Gregg Sulkin, Allegra Acosta, Annie Wersching, Ryan Sands, Angel Parker, Ever Carradine, James Marsters, Kevin Weisman, Brigid Brannagh, James Yaegashi, </b>and<b> Brittany Ishibashi</b>. Then there’s<b> Olivia Holt </b>as Tandy Bowen and <b>Aubrey Joseph</b> as Tyrone Johnson from <i>Cloak &amp; Dagger</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Marvel’s Runaways</i> is executive produced by series showrunners/writers<b> Josh Schwartz</b> and <b>Stephanie Savage</b> (<i>The O.C. and Gossip Girl</i>) along with Marvel’s Head of Television,<b> Jeph Loeb</b> (Marvel’s <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, Marvel’s Cloak &amp; Dagger),</i> and <b>Quinton Peeples</b>.</p>
      <p>Season 3 is set to premiere on Hulu on December 13th. What do you all think about <i>Runaways </i>coming to and end?</p>
