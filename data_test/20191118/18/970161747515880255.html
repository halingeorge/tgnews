      <p>A driver has been jailed for eight years after killing his friend’s girlfriend in a late night 80mph road race.</p>
      <p>Neil Brooks, 49, and Jay Bayliss, 25, raced each other through 30mph residential streets in Brynmawr, South Wales in July 2017.</p>
      <p>Bayliss lost control of his vehicle and smashed into a lamppost, leaving passenger and girlfriend Sophie Brimble, 20, dead.</p>
      <p>He was so severely injured that he was not fit to be charged over his girlfriend’s death.</p>
      <p>Brooks denied causing Miss Brimble’s death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury to Mr Bayliss by dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>However, he was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to eight years.</p>
      <p>Brooks had instigated the race when he recognised Bayliss’ VW Polo, Cardiff Crown court heard.</p>

      <p>Mr Cobbe said: ‘Mr Bayliss was not solely responsible for the collision.</p>

      <p>‘Mr Bayliss was driving at excessive speed because he had got himself involved in an impromptu race with Mr Brooks.</p>
      <p>‘It is a race that started about half a mile prior to the collision.’</p>
      <p>‘Aggressive’ driving by Bayliss and Brooks ‘deteriorated into the impromptu race that in turn caused the catastrophic collision’, Mr Cobbe said.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘They both then drove at high speed along that road, having little or no regard to their excessive speed of the fact that it was through a residential area.</p>
      <p>‘They pushed their vehicles hard through this residential area, both of them reaching speeds in excess of 80mph, their focus now on their race.’</p>
      <p>The pair were driving at more than double the 30mph speed limit in the minutes before the fatal crash, Mr Cobbe claimed.</p>

      <p>The prosecutor added that it was a case of ‘one driver egging the other on’ that led to ‘catastrophe’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Mr Bayliss was travelling way above the speed limit in the lead up to the collision.</p>
      <p>‘He had been driving at excessive speed through a residential area in excess of 80mph.</p>
      <p>‘Mr Bayliss lost control, his car began to rotate and it slid towards a metal lamppost. The result was a catastrophe.’</p>
      <p>In a victim impact statement, Sophie’s mother, Ruth Jenkins said: ‘On that day our lives changed forever, having the police officer tell us that Sophie had died left us in complete shock and for days everything was a daze.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I was so angry with Bayliss for driving like an idiot. How could be so stupid and selfish.</p>
      <p>‘This should never have happened. It was all down to two drivers’ stupidity and carelessness with no thoughts of consequences.’</p>
      <p>Brooks was also disqualified from driving for nine years.</p>
      <p>Judge Michael Fitton said: ‘The loss of Sophie’s life at the age of 20 was a needless tragedy that could so easily have been avoided.</p>
      <p>‘The hurt that has been caused is incalculable.’</p>
