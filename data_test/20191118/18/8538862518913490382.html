      <p>Ever since <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/tetris_effect">Tetris Effect</a> first cleared lines on PlayStation 4 last year, fans have been wondering when they'll be able to get their hands on the soundtrack. As you'd expect of a highly music-driven title, the songs included in the game are fantastic, and many want to see the OST available as a separate purchase. The good news is that it's coming pretty soon, courtesy of <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/">Limited Run</a>.</p>

      <p>As is the fashion, the Tetris Effect soundtrack will primarily be available on vinyl. There will be two editions to pre-order from 22nd November. The first is a two-disc set which contains 17 of the game's most popular tracks ($34.99), while the other -- pictured above -- has the full 40-song soundtrack across five records ($99.99). Both editions also come with a digital download for the full soundtrack. This digital edition will also be available for separate purchase from Enhance Games' Bandcamp page early next year.</p>
      <p>Also coming at the start of 2020 is a new physical version of the game itself. This Limited Run edition will come with reversible cover art, which is nice. Finally, a free dynamic theme based on the final stage of the game is available right now <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0751-CUSA13594_00-TETRISEFFECTDYN2">on PlayStation Store</a>.</p>
