      <p>Robert Armstrong, the Guardian’s former rugby union correspondent, has died at the age of 76.</p>
      <p>Armstrong, who also covered football and tennis for many years, first joined the paper in 1970 as a sub-editor and worked on the arts pages in Manchester before transferring to London six years later.</p>
      <p>A proud son of Ulster, he wrote primarily about football before succeeding the late David Frost as the paper’s rugby correspondent in 1987-88. As well as the 1991 World Cup he reported on the 1993 and 1997 British and Irish Lions tours to New Zealand and South Africa before relinquishing the role in 1999.</p>
      <p>On far-flung overseas assignments for the paper it was not unknown for Armstrong to dictate his copy to his wife, Merete Bates, a former Guardian art critic, who would then phone it in to the sports desk.</p>
      <p>In his later years at home on the Dorset coast he retained a keen interest in sport and politics, even after the recent diagnosis of a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>He died in hospital in Dorchester on Monday with his wife at his bedside.</p>
