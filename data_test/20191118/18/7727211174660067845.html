      <h2>The bug leaves your phone vulnerable to hackers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:00:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>WhatsApp have issued a warning about a software glitch that could leave users vulnerable to hackers.</p>
      <p>The bug lets hackers hide malicious code inside MP4 video files.</p>
      <p>If the victim watches one of the videos, hackers can secretly <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/older-iphones-ipad-could-stop-17163349">run software</a> which lets them carry out a denial of service attack, which stops the target from accessing the internet, WhatsApp <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/massive-list-60-android-apps-17240428">or another service.</a></p>
      <p>The clip can also be used to in a ‘remote code execution’ assault, which means hackers could run a range of software on your phone, perhaps stealing bank account details or using your device to target other people.</p>
      <p>The bug affects Android users running versions of the software released before version 2.19.274 of the WhatsApp software and iOS users prior to 2.19.100.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/whatsapps-latest-update-solves-common-17209870">WhatsApp users</a> are advised to update their app as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Users are also advised to use a new privacy feature that stops them being added to group chats by random people.</p>
      <p>The feature was rolled out to a limited number of people earlier this year but has now been officially released to all users.</p>
      <p>Starting from today, you’ll be able to choose who can add you to groups, letting you block dodgy people or prevent annoying friends from adding you.</p>
      <p>When you’ve updated the app, just open up settings and scroll to ‘account’, followed by ‘privacy’ and then ‘groups’. You will be able to choose who’s allowed to add you to groups, with three options available.</p>
      <p>Select ‘everyone’ and you’re wide open whilst choosing ‘my contacts’ means only friends will be able to add you.</p>
      <p>The early version of the update allowed you to also choose ‘nobody’, which locked your account down entirely, This has now been replaced by ‘My Contacts Except’, which will let you allow only certain contacts to add you to a group.</p>
      <p>In a statement, WhatsApp said: "WhatsApp groups continue to connect family, friends, coworkers, classmates, and more. As people turn to groups for important conversations, users have asked for more control over their experience.</p>
      <p>"Today, we’re introducing a new privacy setting and invite system to help you decide who can add you to groups.</p>
      <p>"With these new features, users will have more control over the group messages they receive. ‘These new privacy settings will begin rolling out to some users starting today and will be available worldwide in the coming days to those using the latest version of WhatsApp."</p>
