      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>The Centre on Monday said that India's economic growth has decelerated but still remains the fastest-growing economy among G-20 nations and there is no slump.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Lok Sabha in a written reply that despite some recent deceleration of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, India is still projected by the World Economic Outlook to grow at the fastest rate in 2019-20 among G-20 countries.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said the average growth rate was 7.5 per cent in 2014-19, which is the highest amongst G-20 countries.</p>
      <p>"The government has been taking several measures to address moderate levels of fixed investment rate in the economy, plateauing of private consumption rate and modest export performance, with a view to increasing the GDP growth of the country," said Sitharaman.</p>
      <p>Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur, who took questions from members, said that the number of taxpayers had almost doubled after demonetisation.</p>
      <p>Responding to queries, Thakur said: "Five per cent (growth rate) is not slump. I want to know which the RBI Governor has said it."</p>
      <p>He said there was slowing down of economic growth across the world but India will be among the fastest-growing economies. He said the goal of a $5 trillion economy will be achieved by 2025.</p>
