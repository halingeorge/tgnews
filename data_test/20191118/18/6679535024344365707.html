      <p>The Hyderabad Pharma City project that the Telangana government proposes to develop on 19,000 acres in a phased manner would be an inclusive cluster comprising a gamut of activities in the life sciences space, a senior official of the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) said here on Monday.</p>
      <p>From research and development (R&amp;D), manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to formulations, to hosting a pharma university, it would encompass several facilities, TSIIC Vice-Chairman and Managing Director E.V. Narasimha Reddy said. Of the 19,000 acres identified for the project, the government has taken possession of 9,000 acres, he added.</p>
      <p>One of the key objectives sought to be achieved through the project is to contribute towards reducing the cost of manufacturing even while contributing to an improvement in the quality of production. The State government has also sought to facilitate collaboration between research institutions with an eye on improving manufacturing cost efficiencies and thereby making healthcare affordable.</p>
      <p>Mr. Reddy, addressing a Health and Pharma Conclave organised here by the industry body CII with the Institute of Management Technology (IMT), said, “We are thinking of launching this project soon, in a couple of months. And we have already got environment clearance”.</p>
      <p>Stating that the project would boost the eco-system that has contributed to emergence of Hyderabad as the pharma hub, he said a medical devices park has already taken shape near the city.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Eatala Rajender said health and education were the priority areas for the government. Highlighting the need for affordable healthcare, he said countries that have focused on good healthcare have progressed.</p>
      <p>A release from the organisers said the conclave discussed the leadership role in bringing in efficiency and addressed current challenges faced by the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
      <h3>Primary healthcare</h3>
      <p>Chairman of CII National Committee on Pharmaceuticals and co-chairman of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories G.V. Prasad stressed the significance of India investing more on primary healthcare, prevention and screening.</p>
      <p>While access and affordability of healthcare were not a “big issue in India”, what remained a key issue was a lack of robust insurance system and less than desired emphasis on primary healthcare and prevention aspects.</p>
