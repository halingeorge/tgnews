      <p>Attacking the government over the detention of sitting Lok Sabha MP Farooq Abdullah, Opposition members on Monday termed the National Conference leaderâ€™s detention as illegal and demanded that he be allowed to attend the House. Opposition leaders raised the issue of MPs not being allowed to visit <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>after the abrogation of its special status, whereas parliamentarians from Europe have been taken to the state, with Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury describing the EU delegation as hirelings.</p>
