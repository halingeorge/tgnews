      <p>cKLrUao9i9oA 1948 Dodge milk truck got a new life, with a car enthusiast transforming it into a hot rod of sorts, in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKLrUao9i9o&amp;feature=emb_title">new video</a> from Urban Hillbilly Videos. </p>
      <p>The rusty Ford milk truck hails from Holland, Indiana and is equipped with <b>34</b>-inch Chevy front fingers and Ford rear fingers. It's cut <b>21</b> inches off the bottom, chopped on the top front by <b>9.5</b> inches and has a grill shell made out of pointy dodge front doors. The milk truck is powered by a Chevy motor. </p>
      <p>The owner had the truck for about three years, not really sure what to do with it. He told Urban Hillbilly Videos he had a vision in his head and when he was asked to compete in a car build in Arkansas this is what he did. "It's totally different. 'Aint another one out there," the owner said. </p>
