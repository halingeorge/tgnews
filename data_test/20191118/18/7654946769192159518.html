      <p>The Supreme Court on Monday issued a temporary stay that will allow President Trump to keep his tax returns secret — at least temporarily.</p>
      <p>The ruling came in the case of Trump v. Mazars, his longtime accounting firm, and House Democrats will have until Thursday to file a response to the order, signed by Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
      <p>Trump’s tax returns <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/court-blocks-trump-bid-to-keep-financial-records-from-congress/">are the subject of multiple lawsuits</a> working their way through the federal court system.</p>
      <p>Trump lawyers filed an emergency petition with the High Court on Friday in a bid to keep the president’s tax returns and other financial documents out of the House’s hands.</p>
      <p>A lower court had ordered that Mazars had to turn over the president’s financial records.</p>
      <p>Trump has asked that the justices protect his financial records from both House investigators <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/trump-takes-legal-fight-over-tax-records-to-supreme-court/">and the Manhattan DA’s office</a>, which is conducting a criminal investigation into his business dealings and alleged hush money payment to porn queen Stormy Daniels and a one-time Playboy centerfold.</p>
