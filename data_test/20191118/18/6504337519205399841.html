      <p>Walking down San Francisco's bustling Market Street this week, something may catch your eye amid all the Allbirds-wearing young professionals scuttling to BART. A white object on the ground: small, but its shape is instantly recognizable. Is that... one half of a very expensive, very trendy pair of wireless headphones? Did that 2-inch $160 microbe of Apple ingenuity fall out of YOUR ear?</p>
      <p>If you're one of the San Franciscans who's been duped into leaning down to pick up what looks like a single AirPod on the sidewalk this week, then you'll realize by now that you've been pranked. SF art director <a href="http://pablorochat.com/">Pablo Rochat</a> has been leaving life-sized AirPod stickers on the ground, and you were gullible enough to fall for it.</p>
      <p>"I see people with AirPods all the time in San Francisco," said Rochat. "I got a pair myself recently, and they're an awkward shape so I drop them occasionally. I see my friends drop them, too. I thought it would be funny just to pretend like everyone's dropping them."</p>
      <p>Therefore, with the help of a high-resolution AirPod image, a printer and some sticker paper, Rochat's diabolical plot came to life. He went out for lunch and started sticking the fake AirPods to the ground on Market Street. Then, he watched the hilarity unfold.</p>

      <p>"A couple of people got mad, which was funny because it was kind of harmless what I was doing," said Rochat. "People get embarrassed that they were pranked, but joke's on them."</p>
      <p>Rochat has even invited others to join in on the fun, too — he posted a <a href="http://pablorochat.com/freebies">free template</a> on his website for fellow pranksters to print out their own AirPod stickers.</p>
      <p>This is not the first of Rochat's pranks. He's wandered through crowds of SF Fleet Week spectators with a giant fake remote controller pretending to be the one <a href="http://pablorochat.com/archive#/air-show-remote-control/">flying the Blue Angels</a>. He's parodied Apple's "Shot on iPhone 6" campaign with fake ads featuring <a href="http://pablorochat.com/archive#/also-shot-on-iphone-6-1/">unflattering selfies</a>. He's even set up a fake TED Talk stage at the 4/20 Festival in Golden Gate Park for stoners to share their ideas.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"I just love entertaining people," said Rochat. Having started out by making funny ads for brands, he eventually realized he wanted to entertain people without advertising. "I love getting a reaction and making people smile and laugh. And posting them online is a good way to get a reaction."</p>
      <p>It's all fun and games for Rochat, but watch out on your walks through downtown San Francisco this week: he's contemplating putting more AirPod stickers down this week.</p>
