      <p>Next month fans will get to hear him perform his Christmas Evening at Exeter Golf and Country Club. The performance is part of his seven night UK Christmas tour which will stop off in Exeter on Tuesday, December 10, from 7.30pm.</p>

      <p>The Osmonds have produced 47 platinum and gold records and no other recording artists have earned as many gold records in one year as the Osmond family.</p>
      <p>It’s Merrill’s voice you can hear on such hits as One Bad Apple, Let Me In, Love Me For A Reason and Crazy Horses. The Osmonds still hold the record today for achieving 11 Gold Award Certificates in one year.</p>
      <p>In August Merrill said his brother Jimmy's return to the stage is 'off the cards' due to his health.</p>
      <p>The US singer, the youngest member of the sibling band, suffered a stroke in December 2018 during a pantomime performance of Peter Pan in Birmingham, where he was playing Captain Hook.</p>
