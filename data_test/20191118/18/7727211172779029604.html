      <p>Barmaid Tina plunged from the balcony of the builders' yard before being beaten to death with a lead pipe by twisted Rob.</p>
      <p>Last week she won hearts when she shared a photo of herself in a car clutching a bag of McDonald's goodies with the words: "Keep what you love close, and your filet-o-fish even closer."</p>
