      <p>Australia captain Tim Paine has accused England hero Ben Stokes of using David Warner to sell his new book.</p>
      <p>Last week, Stokes claimed persistent sledging from Warner inspired his match-winning and Ashes-saving century in the third Test at Headingley last summer.</p>
      <p>Asked whether it was a cheap shot from Stokes, Paine said: ‘Oh absolutely.</p>

      <p>‘It just seems to be a common trend in England that they like to use Davey’s name to spike book sales.</p>
      <p>‘I was obviously standing next to David the whole time and you are allowed to talk on the cricket field.</p>
      <p>‘But by no means was he abusing him or sledging him.’</p>

      <p>Stokes’ stunning 135 not out steered England to a remarkable one-wicket victory over Australia in Leeds and kept the Ashes alive with two Tests to play.</p>
      <p>In an extract from his new book, ‘On Fire’, Stokes said: ‘Warner just wouldn’t shut up for most of my time out there.</p>
      <p>‘A few of the Aussies were being quite chirpy but, in particular, David Warner seemed to have his heart set on disrupting me.</p>

      <p>‘I could accept it from just about any other opponent. Truly. Not from him, though.’</p>
      <p>Stokes’ heroics at Headingley prevented Australia from winning the Ashes outright but the tourists still retained the urn after drawing the five-match series 2-2.</p>
      <p>England all-rounder Stokes will hope to help England beat New Zealand in a two-match Test series that starts on Wednesday evening.</p>
