      <h1>Refreshed England side and Sam Curran hoping to bowl New Zealand over in opening Test</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/scyld-berry/" target="_blank">Scyld Berry</a></address>
      <p>When Captain Cook <b>– </b>not the eminent Sir Alastair but the unknighted James <b>–</b> first saw this northern coast of New Zealand, he observed the beaches, breakers, ferns, forests and fruit and named it the Bay of Plenty, in contrast to the east coast which was Poverty Bay.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/11/17/refreshed-jos-buttler-hits-century-england-finish-new-zealand/">The first Test between New Zealand and the latest arrivals from England, starting on Thursday</a>, will be staged at Mount Maunganui on a peninsula which has one side lapped by the Bay of Plenty and the other by the Pacific Ocean. The England team are lodged across the bay in the more industrial port of Tauranga: Hove is to Brighton what Mount Maunganui is to Tauranga.</p>
      <p>England have played <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2018/02/28/emotional-ben-stokes-says-privilege-represent-country-starring/">a one-day international at this ground – this home from Hove – only last year</a>, when Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler of this squad were involved, and England turned on one of their finest fielding displays. But this will be their first Test, and indeed New Zealand’s. It is a reflection of how the Bay of Plenty is one of the biggest growth areas in the country, and Tauranga one of the fastest-growing ports.</p>
      <p>The Mount is one of New Zealand’s new boutique grounds, one for the coffee-table books. Yet, prosaic truth be told, the ground itself is barely more scenic than the new ground in Newport where Glamorgan played a championship match last summer. Look over the grass mound for spectators to sit on one side and there are train tracks and timber yards, and a white hill of salt awaiting shipment.</p>
      <p>What makes the Mount Maunganui ground “iconic” is the view of the Mount. not the view of the ground from the Mount. Over the next week, at the end of an over, a television camera will linger lovingly on the Mount, little more than a mile away. It was a Maori fort, and is still covered in original vegetation, and home to native birds as well, now that the imported rats <b>–</b> Cook to be blamed here, though not of course the blameless Alastair <b>–</b> have been exterminated.</p>

      <p>A lovely setting then for Root’s refreshed team to begin their two-Test series against New Zealand. They suggest spring-like growth, having so many fresh faces: only the captain, Stokes, Buttler and Stuart Broad have played 20 Tests. A 21-year-old nipper, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/11/13/england-decide-whether-chris-woakes-sam-curran-final-piece-test/">Sam Curran, will be the sixth most experienced in terms of Tests</a>.</p>
      <p>Curran is one member of the Surrey cohort, along with Rory Burns, Ollie Pope, and the debutant Dominic Sibley who moved to Warwickshire. “Sibbers was with me at the Surrey academy and Burnsy is our captain so it is really special to be playing with guys who are familiar faces,” Curran said.</p>
      <p>“I think it makes it a bit easier to be playing with guys you've grown up with. International cricket is international cricket but when you're playing with your mates and you're standing in the field with guys you're familiar with, if things are going badly you can kind of laugh it off and stay positive, because you're playing with mates and that's good fun.</p>
      <p>“I joined the Surrey academy at 14 and that is when I played against Cranleigh where Popey was, and Sibbers was at Whitgift, so I played against them all the way through the academy days until we got into the first team at Surrey. It is a nice little friendship we've got going and I know Popey and Sibbers' parents are coming out as well so it will be special to see so many familiar faces.”</p>
      <p>Burns is several years older but has a vital part to play in Curran’s progress in this series. Burns is the new ball-polisher, and getting the Kookaburra ball to deviate off the straight is a hard job on New Zealand’s boutique grounds which were specifically made for cricket <b>– </b>not like the rugby grounds at Dunedin, Christchurch, Napier and Auckland (to go from south to north) which stage Test cricket in the gap between rugby seasons.</p>
      <p>“I think any bowler who bowls with a Kookaburra is going to say they prefer the Dukes but you've got to learn somehow,” Curran said. “Broady's been saying he's played abroad for 10 years now and you've got to learn to do this because every time you go on tour this is what you've got.</p>
      <p>“It is going to be long hard graft as the series goes on and we'll have to bowl as a pack. Some days you won't take wickets but as long as you hold up an end and the other guys take wickets, that's fine.”</p>
      <p>In the two warm-ups, after his opening spell, Curran bowled mostly round the wicket. “I do it quite a bit in county cricket but probably more overseas where the ball doesn't swing as much. Trying to get the batsmen play a lot more coming round the wicket <b>–</b> it’s just about finding different ways. You've got to find ways, it is a new thing for me to bowl with a red ball in New Zealand so I'm still learning.”</p>
      <p>If these Surrey lads can fit in rapidly with their seniors, it might prove a bay of plenty for England’s cricketers too.</p>
