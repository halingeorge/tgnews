      <p>Several agitated cotton growers staged a dharna in front of the agricultural market yard here on Monday in protest against the alleged delaying tactics of some errant private traders and denial of remunerative price to their produce.</p>
      <p>Cotton farmers started arrived in large numbers at the market yard carrying their cotton produce since the early hours of the day.</p>
      <p>A section of the private traders allegedly refrained from trading expressing their solidarity with a State-wide protest called by cotton ginners over their unresolved demands, sources said. Irked over the non-commencement of trading, some of the cotton growers squatted in front of the market entrance demanding immediate resumption of trading. Leaders of various farmersâ€™ associations affiliated to the Left parties also joined the stir.</p>
      <p>The agitated farmers raised slogans against the errant traders accusing them of resorting to delaying tactics and offering low price for their produce.</p>
      <p>They demanded that the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) start its full-fledged procurement operations at the market yard to ensure minimum support price for the crop. The protesters called off the stir following the intervention of the officials concerned. Cotton trading resumed, albeit at a slow pace, later in the day, the sources said.</p>
