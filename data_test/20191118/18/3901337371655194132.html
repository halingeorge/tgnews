      <p>The 34-year-old took his international tally to 99 goals during Portugal's 2-0 win at Luxembourg on Sunday – is now just 10 strikes short of Ali Daei's world record – and will now return to his club.</p>
      <p>He also <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/cristiano-ronaldo-breaks-silence-on-maurizio-sarri-drama/667637">downplayed talks of a rift with Juve coach Sarri</a>, saying his recent early substitutions were based on him not being 100% fit.</p>
      <p>His recent outburst, though, once again showed how influential he is at Juventus, and the latest reports suggest that he has advised the club to go for a particular transfer target.</p>

      <p>According to <i>Tuttosport</i>, Ronaldo wants record Manchester United signing Paul Pogba to return to Turin.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman, who was on Juve's books between 2012 and 2016 before returning to his boyhood club, has been linked with a move back to the Bianconeri over past few months.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid are also said to be keen on the 26-year-old, but Juventus could perhaps offer United some of their unwanted stars as part of a potential deal.</p>
      <p>Players such as Danilo, Emre Can, Sami Khedira, Mario Mandzukic and even Paulo Dybala could reportedly form part of a swap deal for Pogba.</p>

      <p>The France midfielder has made 148 appearances for United so far, scoring 31 goals and assisting another 31 strikes, but has been sidelined with an ankle injury since September.</p>
