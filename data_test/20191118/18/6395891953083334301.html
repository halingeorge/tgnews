      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Massachusetts Senate is preparing to debate a bill to create a statewide ban on all carry-out plastic bags at checkout from retail stores.</p>
      <p>The bill would require retailers to charge at least 10 cents for a recycled paper bag.</p>
      <p>Five cents would go to the city or town for enforcement of the ban. The remainder would go to the retailer to cover the cost of the paper bags.</p>
      <p>More than 100 Massachusetts communities have already passed plastic bag bans.</p>
      <p>Democratic Sen. President Karen Spilka said she took a personal interest in the ban after a family trip to Vancouver and Alaska this summer where she learned sea animals who can starve to death because of the amount of plastic in their stomachs.</p>
      <p>The Senate will debate the bill Wednesday.</p>
