      <p>(CNN) – Ford is out with a new style of Mustang. For purists, it’s going to take some time getting used to it.</p>
      <p>The company unveiled the Mustang Mach-E Sunday night. It’s an all-electric SUV.</p>
      <p>The Mach-E can go from zero to 60 miles an hour in about 3.5 seconds, according to Ford. For a point of reference, that’s basically the same performance as a Porsche 911 GTS.</p>
      <p>Unlike most electric cars, this Mustang will come with a distinctive sound, like its other models are known for. Ford designers say sound is an important part of the Mustang experience.</p>
      <p>The Mach-E doesn't sound like a deep-throated V8, though.</p>
      <p>The artificially created sound, which can be heard both inside and outside the vehicle, varies to match the Mach-E's acceleration and speed, like an actual engine sound would. The SUV's sound most resembles an amplified electric motor whir, but with a hint of a rumble.</p>

      <p>The new Mustang is expected to be available in late 2020, which gives you plenty of time to save your money.</p>
      <p>Prices for the more basic versions of this new breed of pony start around $45,000. The fancier Mach-E GT Performance Edition begins at about $60,000.</p>
      <p>If that sounds a bit rich for your tastes, there’s some good news.</p>
      <p>Ford executives say the automaker’s electric vehicles still qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit. They expect Mach-E buyers will be able to get that full tax credit for at least the first year it’s available.</p>
