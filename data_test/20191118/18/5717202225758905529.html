      <h1>Report: Manchester City plot to hijack Arsenal’s January move for Upamecano</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:45:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City are reportedly interested in snapping up coveted RB Leipzig defender and supposed Arsenal target Dayot Upamecano.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-city-plot-january-bid-20905918">According to The Mirror</a>, the Premier League champions are weighing up a move for the talented French defender, who has been linked with the Gunners in the past few months (<a href="https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/sport/fussball/fussball/bundesligia-klub-lehnt-arsenal-angebot-ueber-60-millionen-ab-63767592,view=conversionToLogin.bild.html">Bild</a>).</p>
      <p>Upamecano is among the most talented young central defenders in Europe right now, alongside teammate Ibrahima Konate.</p>

      <p>He has made a fine start to 2019/20, appearing in 11 matches in all competitions so far for Leipzig.</p>
      <p>City’s defensive woes have been well documented this term, with Aymeric Laporte’s absence hitting Pep Guardiola’s team particularly hard.</p>
      <p>The loss of Vincent Kompany in the summer has also proven particularly detrimental.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Arsenal can’t lose out</h3>
      <p>Upamecano is an extremely talented player who has the potential to become world-class one day.</p>

      <p>The fact his current deal expires in the summer of 2021 is another reason why Arsenal can’t lose out – there is real potential to secure him at excellent value.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s defence needs bolstering with neither Sokratis and David Luiz particularly convincing. They are also ageing and won’t be around much longer.</p>
      <p>With William Saliba to join the club next summer, getting Upamecano in and at the expense of City would be fantastic by the Gunners.</p>
