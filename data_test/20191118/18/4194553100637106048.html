      <h1>Mixed injury news ahead of Crystal Palace as Gomez is back but Salah and Robertson are doubts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:31:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Joe Gomez is set to be fit to face Crystal Palace at the weekend despite having returned home from England duty early with a swollen knee, according to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-injury-17274638">Liverpool ECHO</a>.</p>
      <p>The less good news is that both Andy Robertson and Mo Salah, via the same report, are less likely to be able to feature thanks to their injuries. They are currently still considered to be doubts for the trip to Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>If neither Robertson nor Salah make it, James Milner will be likely to come into the side at full-back, with Divock Origi probably the favourite to slot into the front line.</p>
      <p>Xherdan Shaqiri could be another option, though he has only played a very small number of minutes this season and that would come as a little bit of a shock.</p>
      <p>With so many matches to come in the Champions League and the Premier League over the next few weeks and into the New Year, getting both players back fit again will be vital.</p>
      <p>The festive period is always a test for any squad challenging at the top, but the Reds will be confident of passing it.</p>
