      <p>MEXICO CITY, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Mexico, Uruguay and representatives of the Caribbean Community on Monday rejected the use of force and human rights violations in Venezuela, urging a peaceful and democratic solution to solve the crisis in the troubled South American nation.</p>
      <p>The group issued the statement after Venezuela's opposition staged nationwide protests against Nicolas Maduro on Saturday and called for a new wave of demonstrations to revive stalled efforts to topple the deeply unpopular ruling Socialist Party.</p>
      <p>"We call on all actors to take the path of a broad, credible and inclusive dialogue for that purpose," the group said. "We reiterate our concern about the humanitarian situation in Venezuela."</p>
