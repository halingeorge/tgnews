      <h1>Pete Buttigieg once said 'there is no way to know' whether he'd have joined the Navy Reserve if it were 'damaging politically'</h1>

      <p>On the campaign trail, Pete Buttigieg plays up his seven months in Afghanistan. But earlier this year, he didn't explicitly deny that his decision to join the military was politically motivated.</p>
      <p>During a conversation, David Axelrod, President Barack Obama's former chief campaign strategist, pressed Buttigieg, 37, on why he decided to join in 2007 while canvassing for Obama in Iowa. A cynic would argue there was "a political motivation" as a "resume enhancer," Axelrod said.</p>
      <p>"Not really, I mean, it was more of the family tradition. Back when I thought I was going to be a pilot, I figured it was the best way to get training, and then I learned that my eyesight precluded getting in that way," the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, replied during the March interview. "I've reflected on that. The thing I asked myself was, if it was as damaging politically as it was actually helpful politically, would I have still done it? I hope the answer is yes, [but] there's no way to know, there's no way to run that experiment, I guess."</p>

      <p>Although Axelrod has offered Buttigieg advice in the past, including suggesting he wear a jacket on the campaign trail to appear older, he's also been critical of the top-tier candidate. Axelrod criticized Buttigieg this month for analyzing the 2020 Democratic primary in an interview with Showtime's <i>The Circus</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/axelrod-says-buttigiegs-2020-prediction-is-campaign-strategists-nightmare">as "unhelpful" and a "campaign strategist's nightmare."</a> Buttigieg later walked back his prediction that the presidential nominating contest would come down to himself and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.</p>
      <p>"I don’t remember the exact context," <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pete-buttigieg-walks-back-claim-2020-democratic-nomination-fight-will-end-in-two-way-race-with-elizabeth-warren">he told reporters in Iowa</a>, adding his comments did not come out "right.”</p>
      <p>Buttigieg, a Harvard University graduate, Rhodes Scholar, and former McKinsey consultant, became a Navy Reserve ensign in 2009, training to become a naval intelligence officer with a specialty in counterterrorism. The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/buttigiegs-husband-america-ready-for-authentic-gay-president">openly gay, married man</a> took leave in 2014 during his first term as mayor to retrain for an Army-style role with the Afghan Threat Finance Cell based at Bagram Air Base and in Kabul. His great-uncle Russell Montgomery was an Army Air Corps captain before dying in a 1941 plane crash, Buttigieg wrote in his 2019 memoir <i>Shortest Way Home</i>.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg's White House bid received a boost last weekend with the release of a gold-standard poll. A CNN/<i>Des Moines Register</i> survey found Buttigieg was<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-status-pete-buttigieg-tops-gold-standard-iowa-poll"> leading the crowded primary field in Iowa</a> as the first choice for 25% of likely caucusgoers in the first-in-the-nation state, compared to Warren's 16%. The November research reflects a 16-percentage-point spike in support since the poll was last conducted in September.</p>
