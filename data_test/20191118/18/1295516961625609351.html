      <h1>Justice League: BossLogic Shares an Epic Snyder Cut Poster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:11:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Renaldo Matadeen</a></address>
      <p>Following petitions and vocal protests by <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/justice-league-film/">Justice League</a></i> fans to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, Warner Bros. also has to contend with <a href="https://www.cbr.com/all-justice-league-stars-demanded-release-snyder-cut/">several of the movie's actors</a> currently voicing similar opinions. Now, courtesy of graphic artist BossLogic, we have an idea of how a theatrical poster could look for the release.</p>
      <p>The image, posted on BossLogic's social media, is very intimidating, with the Lord of Apokolips, Darkseid, front and center. We can see the silhouette of his general, Steppenwolf, just below, and the Justice League's shadows even further beneath, making it clear Darkseid's the focal point of the piece, which even has an HBO Max tag on it.</p>

      <p>Snyder, who stepped away from finishing the film due to a family tragedy, admitted he was <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-zack-snyder-release-the-snyder-cut-support/">humbled by the recent wave of support</a>. He has released several key frames and concept art on his Vero account since the movie tanked. Some have <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-leagues-darkseid-snyder-cut/">shown sequences with Darkseid</a>, as well as deleted scenes with the other heroes, leaving fans to wonder just how different his vision was from what director Joss Whedon helped the studio finish and put out in cinemas.</p>
      <p>The DC Extended Universe continues with Cathy Yan's <i>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</i>, which is set for release Feb. 7, 2020; Patty Jenkins' <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>, out June 5, 2020; James Gunn's <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, which arrives August 6, 2021; and Matt Reeves' <i>The Batman</i>, which will brood into theaters June 25, 2021.</p>
