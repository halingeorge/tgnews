      <h1>Adam Schefter Has Injury Update For Colts RB Marlon Mack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:35:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>When Colts RB Marlon Mack gets going, it’s tough to slow down the Indianapolis offense. Mack was a key piece in the Colts’ 33-13 victory over Jacksonville on Sunday. But the win came with a cost.</p>
      <p>The running back suffered a right hand fracture during the game. According to the latest report from ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Mack will undergo surgery today and “is out indefinitely.”</p>

      <p>This is a tough break for the Colts as they are in the hunt for a spot in the AFC playoffs. But as Schefter points out, Mack’s injury “is not thought to be season-ending at this time.”</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the Colts RB will be able to return for a potential playoff game down the line. Mack was having one of his best games of the season on Sunday against the Jaguars. Before going down with an injury, he had 109 yards on just 14 carries.</p>
      <p>Prior to Sunday’s win, the Colts sat in eighth place in the AFC playoff picture. But their victory over Jacksonville and Houston’s loss to Baltimore has since vaulted Indianapolis up to the 3-seed for the time being.</p>
      <p>The Colts can further their lead in the AFC South division over the next two weeks with contests against the Texans and Titans. But for the time being, Mack will not be suited up for Indianapolis.</p>
