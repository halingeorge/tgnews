      <p>Your work bestie is more than just a colleague (obviously). She’s your career soulmate—by your side when the going gets tough to offer support, a shoulder to cry on, or the just-right meme.</p>
      <p>A trusty work wife is crucial for coping with a high-stress job, so they deserve an extra special gift when the holidays roll around. A candle just won’t cut it, and chances are their desk already has all the decor and monogrammed stationery it needs.</p>
      <p>To help navigate the increasingly complicated (and endless) landscape of potential presents this holiday season, we teamed up with Capital One to pull together a list of giftable experiences worthy of your office one-and-only, and guaranteed to result in some priceless memories. And as a little treat for yourself, you can buy them all with the <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/dining-and-entertainment/?external_id=USCARD_SA001_CNP_HEST_SARC_WEB_SAPDP_P99_D01_ZZZZZ">Capital One® Savor®</a> credit card and earn cash back along the way—4% on dining and entertainment purchases. Now <i>that’s</i> a gift that keeps on giving.</p>

      <p>1. Tasting Menu at a Local Restaurant</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>This is the perfect gift for those with good taste. Who wouldn’t love insanely delicious food and equally important wine pairings? Even if you don’t live in a culinary capital, cities across the country are beginning to see home-grown restaurants pop up that offer eclectic and inventive tasting menus featuring ingredients from local farms. (Here's hoping she wants to dine out with you!)</p>

      <p>2. Concert Tickets</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>Do you and your work bestie blast the same songs on repeat at your desks to blow off steam? Check to see who's playing in town the next couple months and <a href="https://www.vividseats.com/savor-cash-back?utm_source=CapitalOne&amp;utm_Medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=MarieClaire"><u>snag tickets</u></a> for whomever they can't stop listening to—even if it's a band you only want her to play on her headphones. (If you buy tickets at <a href="https://www.vividseats.com/savor-cash-back?utm_source=CapitalOne&amp;utm_Medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=MarieClaire">Vivid Seats</a> now through May 2020 with your Capital One® Savor® card, you'll earn 8% cash back.)</p>

      <p>3. Oprah 2020 Vision Tour</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>Three words: Oprah. Freaking. Winfrey. Lady O is hitting the road and touring North America in the new year for a series of <a href="https://www.vividseats.com/theatre/oprah-winfrey-tickets.html"><u>big-arena motivational talks</u></a> aimed at improving your overall well being and helping achieve positive change. There’s no guarantee everyone will get a car, but an all-around good time is a definite.</p>

      <p>4. An Immersive Theater Experience</p>
      <hr/>

      </figure>
      <p>For someone who’s a little adventurous, interactive theaters offer both an escape and a wild night of entertainment. <a href="https://mckittrickhotel.com/"><u>“Sleep No More”</u></a> changed the game with its fully immersive, mind-blowing experience. Now, there are <i>tons</i> of other options out there, from Shakespearean adaptations (<a href="https://www.drunkshakespeare.com/"><u>“Drunk Shakespeare”</u></a> involves less intense haunted-house vibes) to a contemporary take on Alice in Wonderland (<a href="https://thenshefell.com/"><u>“Then She Fell”</u></a> in Brooklyn is a serious trip).</p>

      <p>5. Art or Cooking Classes</p>
      <hr/>

      </figure>
      <p>Let them flex their creative muscles with a painting, drawing, or sculpture class—maybe they’ll return the favor with a one-of-a-kind work of art. If they’re <i>not</i> as artistically inclined, look for an interesting seasonal cooking class, like pie baking or a fresh pasta course. After all, everyone loves pie and pasta.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>6. A Spa Day</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/06-1571682811.jpg?resize=768:*"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This is probably the most tried-and-true gift for anyone and everyone. A little pampering will always be appreciated. Really wow them by opting for something a little unexpected. <a href="https://wthn.com/"><u>WTHN</u></a>, for example, offers an acupuncture experience that blends ancient traditions with a modern touch. Plus, whether they're looking to run the world (and could benefit from a little stress management) or need a gut check (and want to banish bloat and help digestion), WTHN's organic herb blends will help them start the new year on the right foot.</p>

      <p>7. Mini Wellness Retreat</p>
      <hr/>

        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/07-1571683071.jpg?resize=768:*"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If a spa day doesn’t sound exciting enough for your ultra-glam work bestie, try gifting them an out-of-the-box wellness experience. There’s an endless array of less conventional outlets for bettering one’s mind and body. <a href="https://www.infinityfloatnyc.com/"><u>Infinity Float NYC</u></a> offers a luxe floating sensory enhancement experience that is out of this world. If that’s not quite their jam, <a href="https://www.inscape.life/"><u>INSCAPE</u></a> offers guided meditation classes in their studio (they also have an <a href="https://www.inscape.life/meditation-app"><u>app</u></a>!).</p>
