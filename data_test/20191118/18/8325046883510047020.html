      <h3>Will Disney Plus have an app?</h3>
      <p>Yes, Disney Plus has an app. Not only can you stream its expansive collection of classic and new TV shows and movies on up to four devices simultaneously, but you can also download these titles as often as you’d like using the <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111419_disney-plus-download&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fbundle%3Fcid%3DDSS-Search-Google-71700000051863720-%26s_kwcid%3DAL%218468%213%21395367933346%21b%21%21g%21%21%252Bdisney%2520%252Bplus%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIyLXc8rzq5QIVFJSzCh1WdwWmEAAYASAAEgIo1_D_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds">Disney Plus</a> app for mobile and tablet devices. However, it’s unclear at this time if there are any exclusions on specific shows or movies.</p>
      <p>From the app, subscribers can watch downloaded shows and movies on their phones and tablets without Wi-Fi or a cellular connection. In order to watch offline, you must download the app and the titles you want to watch while connected to the internet. The download icon, located on the bottom menu, allows you to access your saved shows and movies in one place.</p>
      <p>Unlike competitor streaming services, there is no limit to the number of titles you can store and watch on Disney Plus – just make sure you have enough storage on your device and be sure to log in to the Disney Plus app from one of your devices at least every 30 days so the downloads don’t expire. Additionally, you can download the same title as many times as you’d like.</p>
      <p>In comparison, on Netflix, you can only download <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/54816">100 shows and movies on a single device</a>, and depending on your subscription plan, you can only watch downloaded content on <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/64923">one to four devices at a given time</a>. <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/54816">Additional restrictions</a> also apply.</p>
      <p>With Hulu, you’ll run into even more restrictions. Hulu users are limited to <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/downloads?language=en_US#limits">25 episodes and movies</a> downloaded at a time, which are only available on up to <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/downloads?language=en_US#devices">five compatible devices</a>. Another caveat is that <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/downloads?language=en_US#expiration">downloads are also temporary</a>, and there are <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/expired-content?language=en_US">other limitations</a>.</p>
