      <p>Tottenham Hotspur’s need for a new centre-half is clear.</p>
      <p>Both Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen will be leaving the club as free agents next summer as things currently stand.</p>
      <p>Certainly the former appears set to depart, while there have been whispers Vertonghen could yet agree an extension.</p>

      <p>But even if that happens the north Londoners need to buy a long-term prospect in one of the next two windows.</p>
      <p>Perhaps an ideal candidate would be Nico Elvedi of Borussia Monchengladbach, who has been in outstanding form this season.</p>
      <p>Gladbach currently top the Bundesliga by four points ahead of second-placed RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich in third, and boast the best defensive record in the division after 11 games.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Elvedi would be brilliant pick-up by Spurs</h3>
      <p>Tottenham have been linked with Matthias Ginter (<a href="https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/sport/fussball/fussball/fussball-tottenham-und-atltico-heisst-auf-weltmeister-63698034,view=conversionToLogin.bild.html">Bild</a>) and Denis Zakaria (<a href="https://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/fussball/gladbach-50-mio-plus-x-borussia-traeumt-von-rekord-transfer-65395576.bild.html">Bild</a>) already this year, but Elvedi is the Gladbach star they really need.</p>

      <p>The Switzerland international has been with the club since 2015 and is really beginning to shine as a result of the regular game time he has gotten since joining.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is a brilliant ball-player, as evidenced by his 92.5% pass success rate for club and country so far this season (<a href="https://www.whoscored.com/Players/243534/Show/Nico-Elvedi">WhoScored</a>).</p>
      <p>Elvedi is also physically strong. He is a good height for a centre-half (6ft 2in) and is also strong in terms of his positioning.</p>
      <p>He’s been Gladbach’s rock at the back this season, and Mauricio Pochettino could do a lot worse than to monitor him ahead of the coming transfer windows.</p>
      <p>He isn’t on a particularly lengthy contract, with his current deal set to expire in the summer of 2021, suggesting his potential transfer wouldn’t break the bank.</p>
