      <p>China on Monday vowed it would "never be soft" in its crackdown in Xinjiang, after a massive leak of government documents shed new light on the mass detention of Muslims in the far-west region.</p>
      <p>Over <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/leaked-chinese-government-documents-show-details-of-xinjiang-clampdown-report-262676">400 pages of internal papers obtained by the New York Times</a> showed that President Xi Jinping ordered officials to act with "absolutely no mercy" against separatism and extremism in Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>The documents, leaked by an unnamed official, included unpublished speeches by Xi as well as directives on the surveillance and control of the Uighur minority, the newspaper reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Monday accused the Times of "turning a blind eye to the facts" while "taking meaning out of context to publicise so-called internal documents, slander and smear counter-terrorism and de-radicalisation efforts in Xinjiang".</p>
      <p>"China will never be soft in its fight against violent terrorists," Geng said at a regular press briefing.</p>
      <p>Human rights groups and outside experts say more than one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities have been rounded up in a network of internment camps across the fractious region.</p>
      <p>China, after initially denying the camps existed, describes them as vocational schools aimed at dampening the allure of Islamist extremism and violence through education and job training.</p>
      <p>Geng said that "thousands of violent terrorist incidents occurred in Xinjiang" between the 1990s and 2016, but current policies had prevented any attacks in the past three years.</p>
      <p>"The leaked papers clearly reveal and confirm what has been going on in Xinjiang with regard to the all-out suppression and control of the non-Han peoples there (and elsewhere in China), including the massive detention and forced education camps," Fei-Ling Wang, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, told AFP.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Wang said the leak showed the Chinese Communist Party is "not nearly as monolithic as the Party pretends".</p>
      <p>The Times said the papers were leaked by a member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity and expressed hope that the disclosure would prevent the leadership, including Xi, from "escaping culpability" for the mass detentions.</p>
      <p>The documents included the confession of one local official, Wang Yongzhi, who was punished for releasing more than 7,000 people from camps in Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>Wang feared that "rounding up so many people would knowingly fan conflict and deepen resentment", the Times reported.</p>
      <p>Geng said at his briefing Monday that "officials and members of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang fully support" the government's policies in the region.</p>
