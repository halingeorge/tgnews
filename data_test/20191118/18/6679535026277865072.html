      <p>Assuring better service to migrant workers, the Labour Department on Monday opened an exclusive facilitation centre, ‘Shramik Bandhu’, on the Railway Station Link Road in the city. It is the third such centre in the State after Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam to ensure their welfare at the government level.</p>
      <p>Opening the facility, Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan said the welfare schemes initiated by the State government for the migrant labourers by assuring them free health insurance, social security, friendly work ambiance, and fair wages had already caught the national attention.</p>
      <p>“We did all this even as they were being discriminated against in some other States in the name of faith and language,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ramakrishnan said steps would be taken to provide free maternity care for migrant women under the Awaz insurance scheme. “Recently, the free treatment benefits of ₹15,000 under the Awaz scheme have been revised by the government and now, they will be able to claim benefits up to ₹25,000,” he said.</p>
      <p>Medical camps with the support of the Health Department would be conducted for migrant workers, he said.</p>
      <p>The Minister also made it clear that incidents in which migrant workers were found involved in criminal activities and drug abuse would be taken up seriously. “Strong legal actions will be taken against them.”</p>
      <p>Labour Department officials said the Shramik Bandhu would offer its services in seven specific areas. It would help the labourers get better idea on their legal rights and available welfare schemes for their safe stay in the State.</p>
      <p>It will also deal with the labour issues, local guidance requirements, help requests in case of accidents, distribution of Awaz cards and awareness campaigns for improving enrolments, they said.</p>
      <p>Labour Commissioner C.V. Sajan chaired the inaugural event, which was organised in the presence of various trade union leaders. Additional Labour Commissioner K. Sreelal and Kozhikode Regional Joint Labour Commissioner K.M. Sunil were present.</p>
