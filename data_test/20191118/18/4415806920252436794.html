      <h1>Meet the first leader for Operation Transformation 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/steve-neville/" target="_blank">By Steve Neville</a></address>
      <p>The first leader of Operation Transformation 2020 has been revealed.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-one Claire Beakhurst from Malahide was today named as the first leader of the health and fitness programme.</p>
      <p>Weighing 16st 5, the 31-year-old has five brothers and two sisters and is mum to five-year-old Ellie.</p>
      <p>A statement from RTÉ revealed that it was her daughter who inspired Claire to apply for the show.</p>
      <p>"Running around after Ellie is fun but tough, and Claire feels like she can hardly keep up with her.</p>
      <p>"Ellie's dad has never been in the picture, so being a single mum has brought challenges, but Claire says she couldn't have done it without her family.</p>
      <blockquote>It is Ellie who inspired her to apply for the show, to be a good role model and positive influence.</blockquote>
      <p>A barber of 11 years, Claire recently purchased her own Grafton Barbers franchise and is full of confidence in her professional life.</p>
      <p>"But underneath that, she has very low self-esteem," the statement read.</p>
      <p>"She doesn't look at herself in the mirror as she really dislikes what she sees.</p>
      <p>"Her hectic life means she doesn't always eat the things she should: after the school run, she'll stop at the petrol station for sausage rolls and coffee, and she drinks a lot of energy drinks to keep herself going through her busy day."</p>
      <p>A smoker since 14, Claire feels that now is the right time to change her ways.</p>
      <p>The statement revealled that Claire's friends and family "have noticed a change in her personality.</p>
      <p>"She used to be the life and soul of the party, but more and more shies away from being social."</p>
      <p>It added: "At 31, Claire feels all of the extra weight she is carrying. She is sore and tired all of the time.</p>
      <p>"Having tried every diet under the sun she thinks it's time to make a complete lifestyle change.</p>
      <p>"She wants to learn how to lose weight in a safe and sustainable way and introduce a healthy lifestyle into her home."</p>
