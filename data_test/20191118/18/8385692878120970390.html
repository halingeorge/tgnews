      <p>OnePlus has kicked off its <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday sale</a>, which includes discounting the 7 Pro pretty heavily.</p>
      <p>You can now get the OnePlus 7 Pro for just $549. That's $150 off of its regular price, and it is also good for its lowest price ever. This actually makes the OnePlus 7 Pro perhaps the best value in smartphones right now.</p>
      <p>The OnePlus 7 Pro sports a 6.67-inch Quad HD+ AMOLED display, powered by the Snapdragon 855 chipset, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Like with previous OnePlus smartphones, there's no micro SD card slot available here either. So you're stuck with just 256GB of storage. Which, honestly, should be plenty for most people.</p>

      <p>That display on the OnePlus 7 Pro was already big and beautiful, but it is also a 90Hz display. Which makes it feel so smooth when you're using the phone. And for those that are looking for something that's going to be great for gaming, the OnePlus 7 Pro is the one to get.</p>
      <p>The battery included in the OnePlus 7 Pro is a 4000mAh capacity power pack. Which should keep it going all day. Though, if it doesn't, OnePlus does have its Warp Charge 30 on-board. Which is going to charge the OnePlus 7 Pro at 30W. That's going to give you a ton of juice in as little as 20 minutes. So that you are good to go and won't need to sit around waiting for it to finish charging.</p>
      <p>OnePlus 7 Pro is available unlocked. It will work on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile though, as this is not a CDMA smartphone. So unfortunately, there's no support for Sprint or Verizon. Keep that in mind before purchasing your OnePlus 7 Pro, as you don't want to purchase it then turn around and not be able to use it.</p>
