      <p>Apple fans, we have good news and bad news. The good news is that Apple just released new updates for it mobile devices. The bad news is that unfortunately, iOS 13.2.3 and iPadOS 13.2.3 don’t include the major RAM management fix that speeds up iPhones and iPads by fixing the big multitasking bug everyone has been complaining about. You’ll have to wait for iOS 13.3 and iPadOS 13.3 for those fixes (or just install the beta). In the meantime, iOS 13.2.3 and iPadOS 13.2.3 have plenty of other bug fixes so definitely install these updates as soon as possible.</p>
