      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren" target="_blank">Tom Warren</a></address>
      <p>Apple is releasing iOS and iPadOS 13.2.3 today to address a variety of odd bugs that have been introduced with the release of iOS 13. The latest update includes a fix for the Spotlight system search feature that had been failing for some users recently. Search should now work consistently at the system level and in the Mail, Files, and Notes apps.</p>
      <p>If you use an app that downloads content in the background and you’ve noticed weird issues in iOS 13.2.2 or before, Apple is now addressing this in the new update. Mail is also getting updated to fix problems fetching new messages or quoting messages from Exchange accounts. The only other fix that’s listed on Apple’s release notes for iOS 13.2.3 is concerning an issue where photos, links, and other attachments haven’t been displaying properly in the iMessage details view.</p>
      <p>Apple continues to patch up its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20905166/ios-13-1-review-apple-iphone-update-software-app-bug-fixes-patches">buggy iOS 13 release</a>, and hopefully we’re closer to a more stable OS now. Apple is also testing betas of iOS 13.3, which is expected to include some fairly minor additions like better support for FIDO2-compliant security keys that use USB, Lightning, or NFC. Today’s iOS 13.2.3 update will also include any security updates for iOS and iPadOS, and you can download it immediately from your settings menu.</p>
