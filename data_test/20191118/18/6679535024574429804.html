      <p>The leaders of Transgenders’ Welfare Association extended their support to the striking TSRTC employees by visiting their relay hunger strike camp in front of the Collectorate on Monday. Speaking on the occasion, the Association leaders Alaka, Jareena, Ganga and Raksha said the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s actions would not go down well with people if he fails to address the demands of the RTC employees.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the BSNL Employees’ Union donated 25 kg pulses and as many kilos of edible oil to the RTC staff and expressed their cooperation to their cause. The union leader, E.V.L. Narayana, said the decision of the State government to privatise the RTC was insensitive. Noorjahan, District General Secretary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said 50,000 families of the RTC employees were agonised over the adamant attitude of the Chief Minister in solving their problems. “When the wages of MPs and MLAs are revised from time to time, how can the demand of the RTC employees for wage revision be wrong?” she asked.</p>
