      <p>Rudy Giuliani's unflinching love for President Trump didn't come out of nowhere.</p>
      <p>Sure, Trump and <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/871103/almost-comical-corruption-rudy-giuliani">his lawyer</a> have a lot of shared history thanks to their reputations as some of most well-known and <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/875724/trump-changes-residence-from-new-york-florida">New Yorkiest New Yorkers</a> of all time. But Giuliani's staunchest affinity for Trump comes from how the president brings Giuliani and his son Andrew Giuliani together, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/andrew-giuliani-white-house/602110/">Giuliani tells <i>The Atlantic</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Andrew Giuliani has a White House job as an associate director in the Office of Public Liaison, with current and former White House officials telling <i>The Atlantic </i>he coordinates events with athletes. Yet "sports-team visits are more special-occasion than scheduling staple in the business of government," especially with teams often rejecting meetings with Trump, <i>The Atlantic</i> writes. That's led White House officials to say it's clear Andrew Giuliani got a "nepotism job" thanks to his father's name, with one saying "he's just having a nice time" and not exactly working hard.</p>
      <p>But Rudy Giuliani says that's just not the case. This "wasn't the usual 'hire my kid' situation," Giuliani said, because even though his son has "known the president since he was a baby ... they also had a relationship independent of me." That relationship came into play when Andrew Giuliani was a teenager and Rudy Giuliani was going through a divorce with Andrew's mother Donna. Andrew Giuliani "credits Trump with helping him navigate" his father's divorce and "particularly with helping him repair his relationship with Rudy," two former White House officials tell <i>The Atlantic </i>â€” and Rudy Giuliani said he agrees.</p>
      <p>Andrew Giuliani didn't return a request for comment. Read more at <i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/andrew-giuliani-white-house/602110/">The Atlantic</a></i>.</p>
