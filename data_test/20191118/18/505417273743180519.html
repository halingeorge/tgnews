        <b>Mick McCarthy has announced the Republic of Ireland team to play Denmark.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fai.ie/">Ireland</a> take on the Danes for the sixth time in two years in a game where the objective could not be any clearer for McCarthy’s side – if they win, they will qualify automatically for Euro 2020. A draw or defeat will see Denmark go through to the finals, and Ireland will take their place in the Nations League playoff next March.</p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/ireland-mccarthy-fai-euro-2020/">McCarthy</a> has opted for Darren Randolph in goal. The Middlesbrough goalkeeper has returned to fitness after a spell on the sidelines recently.</p>

      <p>Shane Duffy captains the side and starts in the centre of defence, alongside in-form John Egan. Enda Stevens is at left-back and Matt Doherty starts at right-back, with Seamus Coleman missing the game through suspension.</p>
      <p>In midfield, Glenn Whelan, Conor Hourihane and Jeff Hendrick start. Alan Browne, who is a central midfielder by trade, is on the right of a front-three, James McClean on the left and David McGoldrick starts at centre-forward.</p>
      <p>Here is the Ireland team in full for a must-win match:</p>
