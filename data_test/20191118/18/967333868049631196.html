      <p>Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote Friday to IOC President Thomas Bach to "alert him of the risks and consequences" of travel firm Airbnb sponsoring the Olympics, according to her letter, a copy of which was obtained by AFP.</p>
      <p>In her letter, the mayor pledged to reinforce the regulations <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077317466-rent-indian-palace-suite-slept-in-by-oprah-winfrey-princess-diana-at-airbnb/">governing</a> the rental platforms and, if necessary, to have them banned in certain areas of Paris.</p>
      <p>According to Hidalgo, the deal with Airbnb will affect rent prices, cause nuisance to residents and destabilise local trade, with the middle classes particularly affected.</p>
      <p>Airbnb and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) formalised their $500 mln partnership in London on Monday.</p>
      <p>Airbnb will become the official Olympics sponsor at five games including the upcoming Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The company will also beecome a partner of the International Paraolympic Committee.</p>
