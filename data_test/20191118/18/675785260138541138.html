      <h2>The Missguided customer - who measures 5ft 11in - says she cried with laughter when she Tall White Cold Shoulder Satin Cowl Mini Dress online only to discover it was hilariously out of proportion</h2>

      <p>A Missguided customer says she "cried with laughter" after her supposedly tall dress arrived looking more like a "bed sheet".</p>
      <p>Robyn Bowen - who measures 5ft 11in - ordered the Â£10 garment, which is specially designed for taller women, in the hope it would show off her statuesque frame.</p>
      <p>But the 20-year-old says she discovered the Tall White Cold Shoulder Satin Cowl Mini Dress was comically over-sized.</p>
      <p>Despite being designed for women over 5ft 7ins, the dress goes to her knees rather than mid-thigh and the sleeves are so big they slip off her shoulders.</p>
      <p>Robyn, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, posted a snap of herself in the dress and the glossy "official" version offered online by Missguided, showing the dress as considerably shorter and much more fitted.</p>

      <p>She tweeted the photos with the caption: "Ordered a dress but received a bed sheet."</p>
      <p>Robyn, a customer service assistant, had purchased the dress to wear to a work Christmas party.</p>
      <p>Luckily she ordered two other dresses which arrived as expected.</p>

      <p>Speaking today, Robyn said: "I honestly cried with laughter when it arrived.</p>
      <p>"I found it so funny, but I was also disappointed because I had been looking forward to trying it on.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't say it's put me off buying there. I ordered 3 dresses and one of the three was not so good.</p>

      <p>"I've ordered from there before and never had this problem, it was just a bit strange as it looked so nice on the model.</p>
      <p>"The dress was just bigger in general, it was 100% definitely not a size 8 as it was advertised."</p>
      <p>It's not the first time Missguided has been in hot water over their unconventional sizing.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year in August, Leah Richmond slammed the retailer for sending her a pair of size 6 trousers the length of her entire body.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Missguided were also called out by an anonymous shopper who claimed her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/missguided-ad-shown-during-love-20588989">size 8 bikini bottoms</a> considerably bigger than swimwear from other stores.</p>
