      <h1>Chick-fil-A cuts charity ties with anti-LGBTQ groups</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:13:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Brown</a></address>
      <p>Chick-fil-A announced plans Monday to finally confront accusations that the fast-food chain is <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/chick-fil-a-says-it-has-much-higher-calling-amid-charity-backlash/">hostile to the LGBTQ community</a>.</p>
      <p>The company revealed that it would no longer donate to the Salvation Army, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and other groups that have been criticized for their stances on LGBTQ issues.</p>
      <p>Instead, Chick-fil-A said it will only give to charities involved in education, homelessness and hunger — with $9 million assigned to each grouping, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-ending-donations-criticized-by-lgbtq-activists-2019-11?utm_content=bufferfe4e1&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer-politics&amp;fbclid=IwAR2kXuIksawAUPNke-qHwlvUk7_JI4hKTIQiCLlRkWsZX9XlrmExYtulv7A">according to Business Insider</a>.</p>
      <p>“When there is a tension, we want to make sure we’re being clear. We think this is going to be helpful,” Chick-fil-A president and chief operating officer Tim Tassopoulos <a href="https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/retail/exclusive-amid-global-expansion-and-lgbt-pushback-chick-fil-a-changes-charitable-giving-structure-101818">told Bisnow</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s just the right thing to do: to be clear, caring and supportive, and do it in the community.”</p>
      <p>Another Chick-fil-A executive told Bisnow that the company had spent too many years “taking it on the chin” and ignoring protests and boycotts — but the escalating backlash was finally too much to ignore.</p>
      <p>Tassopoulos said the company wanted to narrow its focus on the three charitable areas to be “clear about who we are.”</p>
      <p>“There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message,” he told the site.</p>
      <p>The firm was focusing on education, hunger and homelessness because they are “critical issues in communities where we do business in the U.S.,” he told the site.</p>
      <p>Despite the backlash, Chick-fil-A was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/25/chick-fil-a-named-americas-favorite-restaurant-chain-for-fourth-year-running/">named America’s favorite restaurant</a> in June based on customer satisfaction — for the fourth year running.</p>
