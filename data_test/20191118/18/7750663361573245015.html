      <h1>Manchester United 'handed boost in Bruno Fernandes pursuit'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> have reportedly been handed a boost ahead of attempting to sign <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/sporting-lisbon/"><b>Sporting Lisbon</b></a> midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bruno-fernandes/"><b>Bruno Fernandes</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Despite frequent speculation regarding his future during the summer, Fernandes eventually remained with the Portuguese outfit for the first half of the campaign.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Sun</i>, Sporting may be prepared to do business at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Sporting's financial situation could lead to offers being invited during the January window, regardless of whether they meet the Â£65m valuation of Fernandes.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has contributed eight goals and six assists from 14 outings in Portugal's top flight and the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have also been linked with the playmaker, who helped his national team qualify for Euro 2020 over the weekend.</p>
