      <p>Even before the cargo plane arrived with the first consignment of onions, prices of the essential spice dropped further for the second consecutive day yesterday.</p>
      <p>Visiting different kitchen markets in the capital yesterday, our correspondents found that onions imported from Egypt were sold for Tk 120-150 while the onions imported from Myanmar was sold for Tk 150-170.</p>
      <p>Prices of these varieties rose to Tk220-250 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Zafar Uddin said the government had identified 2,500 traders responsible for manipulating the onion price across the country, reports UNB.</p>
      <p>Action would be taken against them, the secretary said.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of the government, I want to assure people that the prices of onions will come down soon,” he said.</p>
      <p>Cargo planes carrying onions from abroad will hopefully reach the country on Tuesday, said Zafar.</p>
      <p>“A huge amount of onion is also being imported trough sea route,” he said.</p>
      <p>Initiatives have been taken to import onions from Egypt, Turkey, and China via air cargo following the directives from the prime minister, he added.</p>
      <p>In Chattogram, wholesale price of onions imported from Myanmar came down to Tk140-150 per kg at Khatunganj kitchen market.</p>
      <p>The same variety was sold for Tk190-200 per kg a day before.</p>
      <p>Retailers in the kitchen markets, however, still found to be charging Tk 200-230 per kg.</p>
      <p>Abdur Rashid, a wholesaler at Karwanbazar kitchen market, told The Daily Star that there was no mechanism for controlling the onion price and that the traders were selling the bulbs at a price fixed by them.</p>
      <p>Prices dropped as the number of customers reduced significantly in the last two days, the trader said.</p>
      <p>Onion prices began to rise across the country about two months ago when the Indian government imposed a ban on onion export.</p>
      <p>But the prices started to rise sharply in the last week.</p>
