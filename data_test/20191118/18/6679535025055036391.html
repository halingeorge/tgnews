      <p>Indian School of Business (ISB) on Monday said its post graduate programme in Management for Senior Executives (PGPMAX) has been ranked 52nd in the Financial Times Global EMBA 2019 Rankings.</p>
      <p>ISB had participated in the FT EMBA rankings for the first time this year and it is the only business school to be listed from India, a release from ISB said.</p>
      <p>The school and the programme are judged on various parameters for these rankings. In terms of career progress, the school is ranked at 74, with 65% of its PGPMAX alumni fulfilling their goals with an average 43% as the salary increase. The salary increase is measured based on the average difference in alumni salary and their salary before the EMBA and now.</p>
      <p>Dean Rajendra Srivastava said, “We do very well on factors such as experience, international exposure and compensation levels of our graduates. But, we need to improve on gender diversity and attracting foreign students… look forward to improving our future position.”</p>
