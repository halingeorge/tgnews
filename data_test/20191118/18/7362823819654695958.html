      <h1>Chick-fil-A no longer donating to 2 organizations accused of anti-LGBTQ+ views</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:24:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author">Alexandra Deabler</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">Chick-fil-A</a> has announced it will focus on donating to initiatives that further its “mission of nourishing the potential in every child” in 2020 — and that it will no longer be giving to two organizations that it had previously received backlash for donating to in previous years: the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and The Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>The brand issued a news release on its blog, The Chicken Wire, announcing the current focus for the Chick-fil-A Foundation. In the coming year, the chain’s charitable arm hopes to "deepen its giving to a smaller number of organizations working exclusively in the areas of education, homelessness and hunger.”</p>
      <p>“Through these initiatives, Chick-fil-A Inc. and the Foundation will provide approximately $32 million in total cash gifts in 2020,” the <a href="https://thechickenwire.chick-fil-a.com/News/Chick-fil-A-Foundation-Announces-2020-Priorities">news release</a> read.</p>

      <p>For the coming year, the chain has expanded its partnerships with Junior Achievement USA (JA), which offers supportive education services for kindergarten through 12th grade to nearly 5 million students annually; and Covenant House International, which offers services to more than 70,000 homeless, runaway and trafficked children each year. Additionally, the brand has committed $25,000 to local food banks at each new Chick-fil-A opening to help fight hunger. In total, these three initiatives will account for $9 million of the donations, the news release confirmed.</p>
      <p>In the past, the fast-food chain has been highly criticized for donating to organizations that have been accused of harboring anti-LGBTQ+ views, though the restaurant and the foundation have always denied that they sought out these groups particularly for their stances on those issues.</p>
      <p>“To suggest that our efforts in supporting these organizations was focused on suppressing a group of people is misleading and inaccurate,” the company said in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chick-fil-a-responds-to-controversy-over-charitable-donations-denies-seeking-out-groups-with-anti-lgbtq-views">statement in March</a>.</p>
      <p>Still, not all Chick-fil-A fans reacted positively to Monday's announcement. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1196582160335069185">tweeted</a> that he's "headed to Bill Miller's tonight," a reference to a popular BBQ chain.</p>

      <p>Chick-fil-A stopped giving money to several conservative Christian groups in 2012 following backlash to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/twitter-ceo-shamed-for-eating-at-chick-fil-a-over-owners-lgbt-views-expresses-regret">CEO Dan Cathy’s comments opposing gay marriage</a>, but the chain continued to donate to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and The Salvation Army. According to a statement to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-ending-donations-criticized-by-lgbtq-activists-2019-11?utm_content=buffer34656&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer-bi&amp;fbclid=IwAR2gXS7He7-Hx8D2Is93FVGdp35TZVGmP4Qms_n1iOAjbPx5UPkB8-6yMmg">Business Insider</a>, the donations were due to a multiyear commitment the brand had made to both organizations, which ended in 2018.</p>
      <blockquote>“Additionally, the Foundation will no longer make multiyear commitments and will reassess its philanthropic partnerships annually to allow maximum impact. These partners could include faith-based and non-faith-based charities."<cite>— Chick-fil-A</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Going forward, the restaurant has announced it will no longer lock into multiyear contracts, though it may still give to religious organizations.</p>
      <p>“Additionally, the Foundation will no longer make multiyear commitments and will reassess its philanthropic partnerships annually to allow maximum impact. These partners could include faith-based and non-faith-based charities,” the news release shared.</p>

      <p>Chick-fil-A is the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chick-fil-a-will-soon-be-the-no-3-fast-food-chain-in-america-research-firm-claims">third fast-food chain in the country</a> and is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chick-fil-a-americas-favorite">voted America’s favorite chain year after year</a>, but its history of charity donations have hurt the chain’s international expansion in recent months. In October, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/lgbtq-protests-force-first-chick-fil-a-in-the-uk-to-close-just-6-months-after-opening">first U.K. location of Chick-fil-A was announced it would be closing after just six months</a> of opening because of pressure from gay rights activists and protests at the restaurant.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chick-fil-a-toronto-opening-protesters">In September, the first international location of the fast food-chain opened in Toronto</a> to a large protest from LGBTQ+ activists. The group carried signs reading “cluck off” and chanted “shame” as the doors opened.</p>
      <p>According to the news release, since the Chick-fil-A Foundation was founded, more than $52 million “has been donated to support education, entrepreneurship and leadership development.”</p>
