      <p>“I can confirm an arrest warrant was executed at the home of Mayor Dennis Tyler this morning, and he is currently in custody,” Christine Bavender, a spokesperson for the FBI, <a href="https://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/crime/2019/11/18/muncie-mayor-dennis-tyler-arrested-by-fbi-agents/4227206002/">told</a> the <i>Muncie</i> <i>Star Press</i>.</p>
      <p>It is not immediately clear what charges Tyler is facing.</p>
      <p>Tyler has served as Muncie’s mayor since 2012, WISH <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/crime-watch-8/muncie-mayor-arrested-by-fbi/">reported</a>. The Democrat mayor did not run for re-election this year and his term in office ends on December 31.</p>
      <p>FBI agents have conducted an investigation into allegations of corruption in the Tyler administration and those in Tyler’s orbit for nearly four years.</p>
      <p>The FBI investigation began in early 2016 when the agency brought forth allegations against Craig Nichols, the city’s building commissioner. Last January, a judge sentenced Nichols to two years in federal prison for wire fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the FBI also <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/breaking-news/fbi-serving-search-warrant-at-muncie-city-hall/">conducted</a> a search of city offices. When city officials asked about the FBI search, they refused to answer any questions relating to it.</p>
      <p>Authorities also arrested Muncie Sanitary District Administrator Debra Grigsby for allegedly steering contracts in exchange for kickback payments this past July.</p>
