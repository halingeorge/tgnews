      <p>An inquest has opened into the death of a Derbyshire woman who lost her life in floods earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Annie Hall, former High Sheriff of Derbyshire, was swept away in the swollen River Derwent in Rowsley.</p>
      <p>Her body was later found downstream in Darley Dale.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hall's inquest was opened at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/inquests">Chesterfield coroners' court</a> on Monday, November 18, <a href="https://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/inquest-opens-after-death-of-derbyshire-s-former-high-sheriff-annie-hall-in-floods-1-10109955">Derbyshire Times reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Phillip Bateman, of Matlock police station, told the court: "At approximately 1am on November 8, she and her husband drove into floodwater near Darley Dale.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately the car became partially submerged and the engine seized.</p>
      <p>"They left the vehicle on foot and we believe she got swept away by the current.</p>
      <p>"Her body was recovered from flooded farmland half a mile from where she was last seen."</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old, of Buxton Road, Ashford-in-the-Water, was pronounced dead at the scene by a doctor.</p>
      <p>Dr Robert Hunter, Derbyshire's senior coroner, said a pathologist listed the cause of Mrs Hall's death as drowning.</p>
      <p>Dr Hunter adjourned the inquest to a later date.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hall, who was retired, served as the countyâ€™s High Sheriff in 2017.</p>
