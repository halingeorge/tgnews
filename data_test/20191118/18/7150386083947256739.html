      <p>She was admitted to Apollo Hospital in Kolkata on Sunday due to respiratory problems. Other reports suggested that the TMC MP was taken to the hospital because of medicine overdose.</p>
      <p>Down with ill health, the TMC Lok Sabha lawmaker had to skip the first day of the winter session of the Parliament that began on November 18.</p>
      <p>“Jahan was admitted to Apollo Hospital in West Bengal’s Kolkata on Sunday night due to a respiratory issue. She has a record of asthma in the past as well,” Jahan’s office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>She had contested the 17th Lok Sabha election from Basirhat constituency in West Bengal with winning the seat with a huge margin against BJP candidate Sayantan Basu.</p>
      <p>Due to some other engagements, she had also skipped oath-taking for Lok Sabha members on June 17 and 18.</p>
      <p>After her candidature was announced by the TMC, the actress-turned-politician has been subject to trolling on social media for having no political experience to contest polls.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the TMC MP was in the news after she was spotted in the Ashtami celebrations at a pandal in Kolkata. She was also seen playing the traditional ‘dhaak’ or a traditional Bengali dhol.</p>
