      <p><b>DUBAI —</b> Airbus signed two mammoth orders for its A320 and A350 aircraft worth $30 billion at Dubai's Air Show Monday, with Boeing managing only a $1.2 billion sale of its troubled 737 MAX.<br/><br/>Turkish carrier SunExpress said Monday it was buying 10 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, on top of a previous order for 32 of the aircraft, in a vote of confidence for the grounded model.<br/><br/>"We have full confidence that Boeing will deliver us a safe, reliable, and efficient aircraft," the airline's CEO Jens Bischof said.<br/><br/>"However, it goes without saying that this requires the undisputed airworthiness of the model, granted by all relevant authorities."<br/><br/>But the big deals went to its European rival, with Emirates Airline becoming a blue-chip customer for the wide-body A350 jet, and Air Arabia tripling its all-Airbus fleet as it pursues an expansion plan.<br/><br/>Emirates Airline said Monday it would buy 50 Airbus 350-900 widebody aircraft in a $16 billion deal, as it reorganizes its fleet after cutting orders of the A380 superjumbo.<br/><br/>"I am happy to announce we are purchasing 50 Airbus 350 for $16 billion," the carrier's chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum told reporters at the Dubai Airshow, adding that delivery would begin from May 2023.<br/><br/>Emirates serves a global network spanning over 158 destinations in 84 countries. Its fleet stands at 261 large aircraft, including 113 Airbus A380 superjumbos and 158 Boeing 777 planes.<br/><br/>At the time, Emirates said it would buy smaller A330 and A350 models instead in a deal worth $21.4 billion.<br/><br/>The airline said that Monday's announcement "replaces the heads of agreement signed in February where Emirates announced its intent to purchase 30 A350s and 40 A330Neos."<br/><br/>Sheikh Ahmed said the decision "follows a thorough review of various aircraft options and of our own fleet plans."<br/><br/>The airline said the A350 will enable it to serve a range of new markets, including on long-haul routes up to 15 hours of flying time from its base in Dubai.<br/><br/>"It is very good news for Airbus," the European aerospace giant's CEO Guillaume Faury said at the air show, adding he was "very proud that Airbus 350 has been selected by Emirates".<br/><br/>Emirates Airline, the largest carrier in the Middle East, reported earlier this month that its net profits nearly tripled in the half year, mainly thanks to a drop in operating costs and fuel prices.<br/><br/>The result was a change of fortunes for the dubai carrier, which for the full year to the end of March took a heavy hit from high oil prices and currency fluctuations.<br/><br/>Air Arabia said Monday it would buy 120 Airbus A320s in a deal worth $14 billion that represents a major expansion for the United Arab Emirates low-cost carrier.<br/><br/>"The first delivery is expected to start in 2024," said Adel Al-Ali, the CEO of Air Arabia, based in the emirate of Sharjah which borders dubai.<br/><br/>Air Arabia currently operates a total fleet of 53 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft.<br/><br/>Last month it announced an agreement with Abu Dhabi-based giant Etihad Airways to launch a new low-cost airline based in the UAE capital.<br/><br/>The new carrier, Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, will be launched in "due course", Etihad said at the time. — AFP</p>
