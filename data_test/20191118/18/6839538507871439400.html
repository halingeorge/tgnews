      <p>A throwback song that celebrated 1980s funk and soul music has been singled out as the best of the past decade.</p>
      <p>Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’s Uptown Funk danced its way out in front of all others, according to Billboard’s Decade End Charts List.</p>
      <p>From superstars such as Adele and Cardi B, to a few honourable mentions for Aussies, it is an exhaustive list that sheds some light on our listening habits.</p>
      <p>But it’s Ronson and Mars’s catchy 2014 track — a nod to the soul, boogie and disco pop styles of the 80s — that had Billboard out of its seat.</p>
      <p>When it was released, the song was plagued by copyright controversies and became the subject of several lawsuits. Its similarities to the 1979 The Gap Band song Oops Up Side Your Head resulted in the band being added as co-writers of Uptown Funk and receiving 17 per cent of publishing royalties.</p>

      <p>But the controversies did little to diminish Uptown Funk’s popularity, with the song named as the Record of the Year at the 2016 Grammys and featured in the 2017 Guinness World Records for achieving the most weeks at No.1 on Billboard’s digital song sales chart.</p>
      <p>And the video for the song — depicting Ronson, Mars, and The Hooligans band decked out in retro suits walking and dancing languidly along a city street — is the sixth most viewed YouTube video of all time with 3.7 billion views.</p>
      <p>Party songs feature heavily in the top 100, with 2011’s Party Rock Anthem by electronic dance music duo LMFAO taking out second spot.</p>
      <p>Three Australian acts were named in the list, with Gotye’s Somebody That I Used To Know, rating highest at number eight, Iggy Azalea’s Fancy at 62 and Sia’s Cheap Thrills in 66th.</p>

      <p>Billboard senior director of charts Gary Trust said the Billboard charts of the past decade reflected not only memorable musical moments but also the industry’s ever-evolving technological landscape.</p>
      <p>He said the introduction of streaming had changed the way music was consumed — and how the best songs were singled out: “When the decade began, the Billboard ... chart was based purely on weekly sales.”</p>
      <p>But streaming, radio airplay and song sales in all music genres now guide the compilation of the list.</p>
