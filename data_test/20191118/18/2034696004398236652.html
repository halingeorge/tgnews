        <b>Sheeran reportedly played for free "as a favour"</b>

      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> once again broke <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ed-sheeran-announces-18-month-break-concluding-mammoth-world-tour-2542675">his current hiatus on live performances</a> to play a private show for the daughter of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay to celebrate her 18th birthday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-ed-sheeran-learn-to-box-in-shape-of-you-video-1963408">‘Shape Of You’</a> singer played a five-song set, as well as leading a rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’ for Tilly Ramsay, at a James Bond-themed party hosted at Cuckoo Club in Mayfair, London.</p>

      <p>Despite original reports suggesting that Ramsay paid Sheeran’s rumoured fee of £500,000 for a private show, <i><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/gordon-ramsay-hired-ed-sheeran-daughters-18th-birthday-bash-spared-no-expense-11173660/">Metro</a></i> subsequently claimed that he had played for free as “a favour”.</p>
      <p>The move also conflicted with his announcement, made at the end of his ‘Divide’ tour this summer, of an 18-month hiatus from live gigs. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/ed-sheeran-makes-surprise-appearance-tokyo-japanese-band-one-ok-rock-2566188">Sheeran also made another surprise return to the stage alongside Japanese band ONE OK ROCK during their Tokyo gig earlier this month</a>.</p>
      <p>Additionally, he broke the hiatus in September when <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-ed-sheeran-make-surprise-appearance-at-khalids-o2-arena-show-2549153">he appeared on stage</a> at <a href="http://nme.com/artists/khalid">Khalid</a>‘s O2 Arena show to sing his verse from the pair’s collaboration ‘Beautiful People’.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sheeran’s manager Stuart Camp has said that the singer, who’s been <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ed-sheeran-is-the-uks-richest-celebrity-under-30-after-doubling-fortune-to-170-million-2562128">named as the UK’s richest celebrity under 30</a>, is conscious of “overkill”.</p>
      <p>“I never want anyone to be bored of him. But I guess if he’s top of the charts then they’re possibly not,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ed-sheeran-is-conscious-of-overkill-says-his-manager-2562749">he said</a>.<i>“</i>You just want to make sure that’s a fair representation.”</p>
