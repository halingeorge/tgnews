      <p>BANGKOK (Nov 18): The maritime exercises participated by ASEAN member countries with China and the United States (US) reflects practical cooperation in strengthening ASEAN centrality in regional security architecture.</p>
      <p>In a joint statement, ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM)-Plus said the ASEAN-China Maritime Exercise conducted in 2018 and ASEAN-US Maritime Exercise conducted this year had also enhanced mutual trust and confidence among member countries.</p>
      <p>ADMM-Plus is 10 ASEAN member countries plus eight partner countries — Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Russia and the US.</p>
      <p>The statement said all ADMM-Plus defence ministers recognised that security threats and challenges in the Asia-Pacific are transboundary and increasing in frequency and severity.</p>
      <p>It said the increasing regional integration and connectivity, as well as technological advancement, impact non-traditional security threats and increase complexity and unpredictability.</p>
      <p>“This calls for countries in the region to forge practical cooperation to find sustainable ways to prevent and address these common security threats,” it said.</p>
      <p>The statement also said all ADMM-Plus member countries remained committed to ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region by strengthening defence and security cooperation.</p>
      <p>It said ADMM-Plus is a key component of a robust, effective and open regional security arrangement that contributes to trust- and confidence-building as well as practical defence and security cooperation.</p>
      <p>“We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region by working closely together to address common security challenges as stated in the Joint Statement by the ADMM-Plus Defence Ministers on Practical Confidence-Building Measures issued on 20 October 2018,” it said.</p>
      <p>The joint statement also recognised the progress of practical cooperation under ADMM-Plus Experts’ Working Groups (EWGs), namely Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, Maritime Security, Military Medicine, Counter-Terrorism, Peacekeeping Operations, Humanitarian Mine Action and Cyber Security.</p>
      <p>The dialogues and exercises within the framework of ADMM-Plus EWGs have contributed to capacity building and interoperability enhancement amongst ADMM-Plus countries in order to address security challenges for the collective benefit of the region, it said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the joint statement also recognised that the adherence to international law encourages safe and professional military interactions, prevents armed conflict and provides, in treaties and conventions, mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>
      <p>“We welcome the development of ADMM initiatives putting in place practical cooperation amongst ASEAN member states to collectively prevent miscalculation and respond to regional security threats,” it said. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
