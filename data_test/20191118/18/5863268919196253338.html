      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said that incompetent Prime Minister Imran Khan is inaugurating Hazara Motorway Phase II in Havelian which was gifted by the former premier Nawaz Sharif to Pakistan.</p>
      <p>She expressed why PM Imran is inaugurating the project of a person whom he called a thief, adding that he is politicizing the health of that person who initiated the project.</p>
      <p>The PML-N spokesperson said that Imran Khan, like the whole country, should have prayed for Nawaz Sharif, who gave the plan of Hazara Motorway to Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Marriyum Aurangzeb said that Shehbaz Sharif has always exercised politics by serving others, and signs of jealousy are evident on PM Imran’s faces. “Being jealous of Shehbaz Sharif has made you mentally ill”, she added.</p>
      <p>She continued saying that today another plan of Nawaz Sharif was plastered with the name of an incompetent leader. “With the completion of Hazara Motorway construction, the dream of the PML-N supremo has been fulfilled today”, she added, congratulating the people of Hazara and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p>
      <p>Marriyum Aurangzeb said that the incompetent premier has not been able to inaugurate even the already completed Lahore-Multan and Multan-Sukkur motorway for a year. “PM Imran is inaugurating those projects he used to criticize”, she added. </p>
