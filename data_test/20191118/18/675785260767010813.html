      <p>A man who kidnapped his girlfriend led a double-life in which he posed as the victim online and had a wife, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>John Matthew Chapman has been in custody after he allegedly kidnapped his former girlfriend Jaime Rae Feden, 33, in the US.</p>
      <p>The Pennsylvania man is accused of bounding and suffocating her then dumping her body in the Nevada desert.</p>
      <p>Feden, who was just over 4-ft tall, had been missing two months before a woman's remains were found in the desert.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that on Friday he admitted to officers at Bethel Park Police Department that he killed Feden in Las Vegas by suffocating her.</p>

      <p>Chapman is believed to have also confessed of his crime to Maureen Chapman - a woman he has been married to for just over a year.</p>
      <p>Maureen had no idea that her husband had another partner or that he killed her, until Chapman phoned from the police department at around 6am, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/who-is-john-chapman-man-who-told-police-he-left-local-woman-to-die-in-vegas-desert/1009193744">WXPI:</a> "He said he had murdered a woman. I was in disbelief."</p>

        <figcaption>Maureen said she was in "disbelief" when she heard the Chapman's alleged confession</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The apparent confession has left Maureen questioning her relationship with the 39-year-old, who she now believes was leading a double life.</p>
      <p>She said that her husband told her that he killed Feden "because I had to".</p>
      <p>Chapman allegedly told his wife that he had to travel in Feden's truck for work after a trip to see his aunt and uncle.</p>
      <p>"Oh, my God, it's sick. It's really sick," Maureen said.</p>

      <p>"I just want the truth as to what happened. I feel I'm owed that."</p>
      <p>The suspect's family told Channel 11 that he met Feden at a school for students with special needs in around 2009.</p>
      <p>Police said Chapman would often stay at Feden's Bethel Park home.</p>
      <p>The situation is confused by Chapman's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page which lists him as a single man from Pennslyvania.</p>
      <p>His relationship with Maureen is obscured by the fact she is listed as her sister on the website.</p>

      <p>Beneath one photo he commented: "Lookin good sis."</p>
      <p>According to police documents Chapman convinced Feden to drive into the desert for a photo shoot.</p>
      <p>He allegedly bound her feet and hands with zip ties before tying her to a lamppost.</p>
      <p>Chapman then bound her mouth and nose with duct tape, causing her to suffocate,  it is alleged.</p>
      <p>After the death he used feden's phone to send messages to her family while pretending to be her, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>Nikki Lawrence, a close friend of Feden's, said the 33-year-old probably had no idea that Chapman was married.</p>

        <figcaption>Nikki Lawrence was sceptical of the relationship before Feden went missing</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She claimed Chapman mistreated her friend, used her for money and once arrived at a bar with her sporting two black eyes.</p>
      <p>"The owner of the bar chased him down the street. After that he didn’t really come around any of her friends and family," she <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/olivianiland/john-chapman-alleged-murder-jaime-feden-las-vegas">told Buzzfeed News</a>.</p>
      <p>"It makes me physically sick," Lawrence said, adding that she believes Chapman was posting photos and check-ins to Feden's Facebook account weeks after she was last seen by family and friends.</p>

      <p>Feden's family, who had not seen her since September 15, reported her missing on Thursday.</p>
      <p>During a welfare check of Feden's home that day, crime scene investigators recovered her phone and a backpack with plastic zip ties and duct tape inside, according to CBS 2.</p>
      <p>Nevada officials are now working to identify a body they found on Oct. 5 that matches Feden's description.</p>
      <p>She was born with a syndrome a series of birth defects that affect several parts of the body and caused her short height.</p>

      <p>According to an anonymous listing on the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System a body found on October 5 matched Feden's description and bore two tattoos -  one read "Keith, Robin, Jason" and the other was a four-leaf clover on the right lower leg.</p>
      <p>Lawrence told BuzzFeed News that Feden had the same tattoo in honour of her uncle, brother and mother, who died when she was young.</p>
      <p>Chapman has been charged with kidnapping, obstructing administration of law, and criminal use of a communication facility.</p>
