      <h1>Ex-Notts County manager Kevin Nolan odds-on favourite to take charge of Grimsby Town</h1>
      <h2>Former Newcastle midfielder is keen on a return to the dugout</h2>

      <p>Former Notts County manager Kevin Nolan is the overwhelming favourite to take charge of Grimsby Town as the Mariners search for a successor to Michael Jolley.</p>
      <p>Nolan is currently 5/6 favourite to land the job at Blundell Park after Jolley left the League Two club   by mutual consent last week.</p>
      <p>The former Newcastle captain has been without a club since he was sacked by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> last August having been appointed John Sheridan’s successor by previous owner Alan Hardy in January 2017.</p>
      <p>After Nolan took over, he led the Magpies to safety in League Two before guiding them to the play-offs which they lost to eventual winners Coventry City in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>He was then instructed to bring down the average of the squad following that disappointment, and the former West Ham and Newcastle captain was then sacked after losing four of his opening five games.</p>

      <p>Many fans still feel that his departure was the catalyst for Notts sliding out of the Football League and he left Meadow Lane with a win ratio of more than 40 per cent.</p>
      <p>But the 37-year-old is keen on a return to the dugout and has been linked with Lincoln City and Bolton Wanderers in recent months.</p>
      <p>Should he take over at Grimsby he will inherit a side that is currently 18th in League Two.</p>
