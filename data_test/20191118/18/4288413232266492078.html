      <p>This beautifully-shot film from 2017 has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/dy48os/this_very_satisfying_video_of_the_process_behind/">making the rounds again</a> this morning, showing the making/assembly of <a href="https://www.adorama.com/lcm10s.html?kbid=67085">the Leica M10</a>. And like all “making of” videos that take us inside a camera or lens factory, it offers a mesmerizing look at the attention to detail that goes into assembling each digital rangefinder that Leica makes.</p>
      <p>The video, published under the very Leica-esque title “A masterpiece in the making,” takes you inside Leica’s factory in Wetzlar, Germany to see how each Leica M10 is hand-assembled.</p>
      <p>There’s no talk track or explanations during the video, just a quick 4-minute peek at the assembly process, starting with the chipset assembly and ending with the careful placement of the iconic “red dot” Leica logo.</p>

      <p>“The assembly process spans from connecting the roller-lever with the rangefinder, to calibrating the sensor and image board, all the way to attaching the rear shell and top plate,” writes Leica on <a href="https://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-M/Leica-M10/Designed-and-made-in-Germany#M10-LifeCycle">the webpage</a> that accompanies this video. “More than 50 adjustment steps are required to build a camera with the utmost mechanical and optical precision such as the M10. It encompasses around 1,100 single components – including 30 that have been milled from brass, 126 screws and 17 optical elements.”</p>
