      <p>The moment Jodie Chesney's killers were caught was captured on footage released on the day they were locked up for life.</p>
      <p>Today the killers of Jodie Chesney, Arron Isaacs and Svenson Ong-a-Kwie were locked up for her murder in Harold Hill, east London on March 1.</p>
      <p>Ong-a-Kwie, 19, burnt his clothes and disposed of the knife he used to stab the 17-year-old Girl Scout with immediately after the attack.</p>
      <p>He had been lying low at the home of 17-year-old Arron Isaacs' uncle in Dagenham, east London, when police swooped to arrest them both on the evening of March 10.</p>
      <p>As officers approached the house they heard a commotion outside and an officer shouted: "Around the back."</p>

      <p>In police body-worn video, Ong-a-Kwie can be seen clambering over a rear flat roof and crashing into the conservatory below.</p>
      <p>An officer shouted: "Stay where you are. Show me your hands now. Get over here now."</p>
      <p>As he was handcuffed, an officer confirmed to colleagues that he was "detained".</p>
      <p>When told he was arrested on suspicion of murder, Ong-a-Kwie said: "What? Murder? I killed no-one."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Isaacs had escaped through a window but was apprehended in the back garden with a rucksack containing a deadly Rambo-style knife.</p>

      <p>He was initially arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, but was later also charged with Jodie's murder.</p>
      <p>The footage was released by the Metropolitan Police as Ong-a-Kwie was jailed for at least 26 years and Isaacs was locked up for at least 18 years for their part in Jodie's death on March 1.</p>

      <p>At the Old Bailey sentencing hearing Judge Wendy Joseph QC spoke about the horrific stabbing.</p>
      <p>She said: "What matters is that they left the area, and prepared to attack and that is exactly what they did.</p>
      <p>"They came back to the park in the car of Manuel Petrovic.</p>
      <p>"He was asked to help because Ong-a-Kwie trusted him.</p>
      <p>"I reject that Svenson went back to his hostel to pick up two small bags on cannabis.</p>
      <p>"One of you plunged a knife into Jodie's back.</p>

      <p>"Jodie screamed until she could scream no more. Svenson burnt his clothes that night and the teenager disposed of his too."</p>
      <p>The defendants denied Jodie's murder, each blaming the other for inflicting the fatal wound.</p>
      <p>But prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors that both were responsible for the killing, amid incidents of "casual violence" in the drug-dealing world.</p>
      <p>The jury deliberated for less than six hours to find them guilty last week of Jodie's murder.</p>
