      <p>Tony’s charmed Joy – he sits down for a drink with her in The Bull to apologise for flying off the handle when she complained about his cow leaflet. They manage to have a conversation where Joy doesn’t refer to Rochelle once. Kate suggests Pat should watch out – Tony’s put a real spring in Joy’s step.</p>
      <p>There’s something afoot though. Rochelle and family were expected in town today yet Joy is drinking alone at The Bull. Is Joy actually just a lonely fantasist with no daughter?</p>
      <p>Mierrr comes to visit Will after a successful belated Bonfire Night party. She and Will are getting on nicely – but when she talks about coming to stay over at Greenwood Cottage, Will bottles telling her that he lost it along with his job.</p>
      <p>Lilian inadvertently lets the cat out of the bag when Mierrr is talking to Emma – and Mia is furious. That’s it – she should have known Will hadn’t changed. Time to send in Clarrie (again).</p>

      <p>Alice and Chris went to Anisha’s wedding – even if Rex couldn’t stomach it. Their heads are turned by the prospect of working at a farriers down in Newmarket. Alice spills the tea to Kate and Chris is not amused.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth talks to Jim about the Victorian ghost stories in the attic at Lower Loxley. It’s heartening to see Jim gradually getting back his confidence – first the piano at The Bull, now this. The grip of his life-long abuser could be loosening as he shares his trauma and rebuilds his life with more support around him.</p>
      <p>Russ and Lily have a bust-up – he thinks he’s still in the doghouse for keeping the details of his child bride but Lily has something else on her mind: photos on her friend’s phone taken at The Bull from the night of Freddie’s party reveal Bella kissing a mystery man.</p>
      <p>Lily is seriously rattled – can she tell Johnny? It will break his heart. Freddie says she must tell him – and quick. If Bella is doing the dirty, Johnny should know.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, love is apparently in the air for Jill and Leonard. He’s been looking after her after she injured her wrist – even going as far as to do up her buttons, to David’s horror (frankly David, you should be pleased he’s not undoing them…yet!). But now, with Jill reminiscing about her late husband on their anniversary and telling how much she had wanted him to propose to her so he was no longer his former wife’s widow, could she be hinting that she wants Leonard to propose?</p>

      <p>David will be horrified, of course. He can’t bear the idea of Leonard having more than a platonic interest in his ageing mother.</p>
      <p>So will Leonard pop the question? We will find out this week…</p>
