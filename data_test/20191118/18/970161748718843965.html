      <p>In Season 3, episode 3 of The Crown, the fictionalised TV show based on history <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/27/the-crown-season-3-recreates-aberfan-disaster-15-miles-from-village-to-avoid-upset-7984616/">portrays the Aberfan disaster</a> and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/04/olivia-colman-is-the-spitting-image-of-the-queen-as-she-films-aberfan-disaster-visit-for-netflixs-the-crown-8006860/">Queen’s response to the horrifying catastrophe</a>.</p>
      <p>But what actually happened in Aberfan and what was the Queen’s response in reality?</p>
      <h3>What happened at the Aberfan disaster?</h3>
      <p>The Aberfan disaster refers to a devastating tragedy that took place in 1966.</p>
      <p>Aberfan, a small village in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/wales/">Wales</a>, was rocked to its core when, at 9.15am on October 21, Pantglas Junior School was buried under an avalanche of slurry caused by the collapse of a nearby spoil tip full of surplus mining waste.</p>

      <p>The avalanche hit the school when it was full of children and teachers about to start their lessons for the day and sadly, 116 children and 28 adults were killed.</p>
      <h3>What was the Queen’s response to the Aberfan disaster?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/">The Queen</a>’s public reaction to the accident has been known to split opinion, as she did not visit the Welsh community until eight days after the tragedy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-philip/">Prince Philip</a> travelled to Aberfan without the Queen the day after the incident, visiting the Welsh village on October 22, 1966.</p>
      <p>Princess Margaret’s husband at the time, Lord Snowdon, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/30/crown-series-3-princess-margarets-marriage-lord-snowdon-comes-spotlight-new-sneak-peek-pics-8293983/">who will feature prominently in the current season of The Crown</a>, also visited Aberfan of his own accord.</p>
      <p>Speaking to WalesOnline in 2006 Snowdon said he felt: ‘the Welsh should stick together’ and because he was Welsh he, ‘just got on a train and went straight down.’</p>

      <p>When the Queen did make the journey to Aberfan, those who were there describe her as ‘visibly upset’ by what she saw and many did not criticise her decision to delay her visit.</p>
      <p>Jeff Edwards, who survived the disaster when he was eight years old, told the South Wales Echo in 2002: ‘When she did arrive she was visibly upset and the people of Aberfan appreciated her being here…She came when she could and nobody would condemn her for not coming earlier, especially as everything was such a mess.’</p>

      <p>According to biographer Sally Bechdel Smith, Queen Elizabeth’s decision to delay her visit to the Welsh village after the disaster was linked to her concern that she would be a potentially fatal distraction to the cause at hand, which was trying to rescue children from the buried school.</p>

      <p>”People will be looking after me,’ she said according to Smith. ‘Perhaps they’ll miss some poor child that might have been found under the wreckage.’</p>

      <p>In notes at the end of the third episode of season three of The Crown, it says that the Queen’s slow reaction to visit Aberfan remains ‘one of her biggest regrets as monarch’.</p>

      <p>The producers of The Crown have handled the inclusion of the Aberfan disaster in the series incredibly sensitively, and they also released a statement ahead of the new series about how they went about portraying the tragic event in the show:</p>
      <p>‘The third season of The Crown will cover the major historical events of Elizabeth II’s reign from 1963-1977 and all strongly felt the Aberfan disaster and the events that followed must be included, especially as it continues to hold a deep resonance for the nation and the Queen herself.’</p>

      <p>As producers, we feel a responsibility to remain true to the memory and the experience of the survivors, so have met with community leaders, as well as the people of Aberfan on a number of occasions as part of our in depth research and to discuss our approach.’</p>
