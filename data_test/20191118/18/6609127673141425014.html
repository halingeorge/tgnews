        <b>AN EDINBURGH Morrisons supermarket was robbed by a gang of thugs who stole thousands in cash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Four men broke into the retail giant’s store in the New Swanson area of the city at around 12.20am this morning after making their way in through a window.</p>

      <p>They then nicked a five-figure sum of cash before fleeing from the scene.</p>
      <p>And cops are now hunting the brazen thieves as they appeal to the public for information.</p>
      <p>They say the robbers would have only been in the store for a "relatively short period of time".</p>
      <p>And they also said that the thieves would have departed on foot.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Bob Campbell of Corstorphine CID said: "Our inquiries so far suggest that the people responsible for this incident would only have been within the store for a relatively short period of time before leaving on foot.</p>
      <p>"We would urge anyone who may have been in the area or could have seen any suspicious people or vehicles around the supermarket overnight to come forward.</p>
      <p>"I would also ask anyone who may have been driving in the area to review any dashcam footage and report anything which may be of use to us.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who believes they can help is asked to call 101, quoting incident 0038 of November 18 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111."</p>
      <p>We told last month how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4861274/thief-stole-donations-glasgow-chapel-christmas-day/">a thief who stole donations from a chapel</a> on Christmas Day has avoided jail.</p>
      <p>James Caldwell, 38, prowled St Brendan's in Glasgow's Yoker at the end of morning mass last December.</p>
      <p>He then waited until it was quiet before swiping the money.</p>
