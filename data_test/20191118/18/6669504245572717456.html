      <p>NEW YORK - You can never be too old for "Sesame Street." The beloved children's series premiered 50 years ago this month and is still a favourite among both kids and adults. Some celebrities share their thoughts on seeing the show — and some of being on the show.</p>
      <p>"'Sesame Street' is, I think, the purest form of entertainment that has ever come through the television screens. I grew up watching 'Sesame Street.' Seeing them grow along with the changing times, along with the impact that they've made on children who were going through different struggles, whether it was their parents divorcing or autism — they've adapted to so many different situations, but they've always had the purest heart with it. 'Sesame Street' actually makes me emotional with how caring and loving and pure and kind they've been throughout the years. It's just nothing lights up a kid's face like seeing Elmo." — TV personality Chrissy Teigen.</p>
      <p>“I forgot that there were people there. They were so real. I really felt like I was dealing with these critters and these creatures that were created so beautifully. The puppeteers were absolutely brilliant because you forgot that they were there. They just knew how to do it.” — Comedy icon Carol Burnett, who appeared in the first broadcast and returned frequently.</p>
      <p>"I learned how to count on 'Sesame Street.' I learned the alphabet. While people were watching it on television, I was part of it, so that to me was really, I think, the beginning of this very creative world.” — Actress Kim Raver, a former child "Sesame Street" cast member.</p>
      <p>"Jim Henson's been one of my idols ever since I was a little kid. I still have a workshop down in my basement right now where I make puppets out of foam, ping pong balls for eyes and things. I think there's something so special about making inanimate objects animate and when they can teach kids globally about not only letters and numbers and vowels but about sharing and responsibility, that's something that will endure for 50 more years realistically." — Actor Neil Patrick Harris.</p>
      <p>"'Sesame Street' just has always pushed the envelope and pushed us to look at ourselves in a different way and each other in a compassionate way. And they did it with humour and they did it in a way that made it very palatable. So I think that's the genius of the show and why it's touched so many for so long." — Actor/director Emilio Estevez.</p>
      <p>"I definitely watched it as a kid. I think it's not just entertainment, you know? I think there's some lessons to learn behind it and I think as humans, we're drawn to that. We're drawn to sort of seeing people in this problematic light and then watching them sort of cope with it and how they cope with it. I think as kids we're sort of taking those things in and we're soaking it up and we're like, 'Oh, one day when I'm there, then this is how I'm going to deal with it.' So I don't think it's just entertainment. I think you're really learning something and I think that's what makes great television." — Actress Olivia Holt.</p>
      <p>“I watched it as a kid. Everyone watched it. It's amazing. My mom was like, 'Oh that's the anniversary of when I watched it,' and I'm like, 'Oh, my gosh,' because it came out when she was born. So, yeah. It's not even like an iconic thing, it's a lifestyle." — Singer Meghan Trainor.</p>
