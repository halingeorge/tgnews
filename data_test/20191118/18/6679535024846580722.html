      <p>The GHMC would take up 360 degree sanitation work in all the 150 wards in the coming days, said Mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan, and appealed to the citizens, resident welfare associations, self help groups and NGOs to participate in the programme.</p>
      <p>He addressed the representatives of RWAs, and basti committees on Monday and said though regular sanitation work was on, the corporation proposed to intensify the city clean-up by organising a special sanitation drive.</p>
      <p>For the special drive, 50% of the staff from Engineering, Town Planning, Entomology, Urban Biodiversity, Veterinary, Urban Community Development and Enforcement wings would be roped in.</p>
      <p>Dates for the drive would be announced in future, and it would go on for two to three days in each ward. It would include work such as cleaning the main roads, filling of pot holes, removing debris and construction waste, weed removal in open places, and removal of solid waste material from manholes, drains and nalas.</p>
      <p>Clearing the plastic covers, replacing of manhole covers, repair of sewerage lines, removing debris near transformers, repair of footpaths and dividers, fogging and anti-larval operations, checking street dog menace, and others too would be part of the drive.</p>
      <p>Besides, inspections would be conducted to ensure hygiene at various roadside eateries and hotels, a press statement said.</p>
