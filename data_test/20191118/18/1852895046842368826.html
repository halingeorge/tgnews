      <h4>Kristen Doute tells HollywoodLife that she’s just as clueless as ‘Vanderpump Rules’ fans about why Stassi Schroeder and Katie Maloney aren’t speaking to her! She opens up about their feud, which was previewed in the season 8 trailer.</h4>
      <p><b>Kristen Doute</b> is still trying to figure out what led to her ongoing rift with her <i><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/vanderpump-rules/">Vanderpump Rules</a> </i>co-stars <b>Katie Maloney </b>and<b> Stassi Schroeder</b>. The feud between the once close friends was previewed in the new, <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/07/vanderpump-rules-season-8-trailer-video-watch/">explosive trailer</a> for season 8 that dropped on November 7. “The trailer was like, ‘Oh snap.’ And then I saw the first episode and my brain just exploded,” Kristen told <b>HollywoodLife</b> during an exlcusive interview while at the first annual <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/pics/bravocon-2019-pics-photos/"><b>BravoCon</b></a> in New York City on November 16. </p>
      <p>“It’s really not — no,” Kristen replied when asked if it was awkward to be at BravoCon with Stassi and Katie. “We’re not at the level that we were at before, but I’m hopeful that one day we can get back there,” she said, noting that she would “die to know,” why they’re not speaking in the first place. </p>
      <p>Ultimately, Kristen is hoping that she can get to a better place with Katie and Stassi. “I would actually prefer if we could just get to a different place because I think, you know, there were obvious moments of toxicity, that people saw. You can even watch it on the show, with the bickering and the fighting,” she said, explaining, “I think we were growing up and we were going to these big monumental changes and like buying houses and getting engaged and getting married and being single.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, Kristen has faith in at least a civil future with Stassi and Katie because of how much all three care about <i>Vanderpump Rules</i>.  “When we’re all here together, like we’re just so proud of the show and what we’ve all created together that all of the bullsh-t just goes out the window. It doesn’t matter,” she said. </p>
      <p>I’m going to watch it with the fans. I hope that I get an answer by the end of the season. So, when I get to the reunion, I know what to talk about because I really don’t know.</p>
      <p>As for the upcoming eighth season of the hit show, Kristen revealed that she tried to work things out with the two. “You’ll see it all over season eight. I tried to have many conversations. Like deep-rooted conversations, oh God,” she said. </p>
