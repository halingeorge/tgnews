      <p>On Monday night viewers saw the first Dingo Dollar Challenge of I'm A Celebrity's new series but there was something, or rather someone, missing again - Kiosk Keith.</p>
      <p>In years gone by we've seen straight-faced and tough-talking Keith take no prisoners as campmates have got plenty of questions wrong, resulting in him pulling the shutters down on his kiosk rather than handing them a treat.</p>
      <p>But this time round, just like last year, he has been replaced by, and while his replacement is just as ruthless, fans of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> have once again been left wondering where Kiosk Keith was.</p>
      <p>"Remember in Neighbours when Lucy Robinson was sent to boarding school and she came home from the holidays and she was a completely different actress?" explained <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> to co-host Holly Willoughby last year.</p>
      <p>"Well it's a little bit like that."</p>
      <p>But there seems to be more to it.</p>
      <p>Twelve months ago <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/7668674/why-is-kiosk-keith-not-on-im-a-celeb-this-year-who-is-replacing-him/">The Sun</a> alleged the 53-year-old was dropped from the show after bad behaviour at work.</p>
      <p>A source told the paper he turned up drunk and behaved inappropriately towards a female colleague.</p>
      <p>The source alleged: “It wasn’t unusual for Keith to turn up to work drunk as he’s done it before but this incident has shocked everyone.”</p>
