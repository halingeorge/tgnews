      <p>A group of bounty hunters waded into a freezing river to capture a fugitive suspected pedophile on the run since 2017.</p>
      <p>The gang of US Army veterans, who call themselves BEAST (Bail Enforcement Apprehension &amp; Surveillance Team) snared Vinton Nation, 30, late on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>BEAST shared snaps of the moment they caught Huntley in Fayetteville, North Carolina, <a href="https://www.wral.com/fayetteville-bounty-hunters-dive-in-to-aid-in-capture-of-sex-crimes-fugitive/18775946/">WRAL</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Writing on Facebook, they said: ‘Ladies and Gentlemen it is with great excitement to announce that B.E.A.S.T Fugitive Recovery apprehended one of North Carolina’s most wanted Fugitives tonight.</p>
      <p>‘We had to jump in a freezing cold river to get him as he was running from us, but it was definitely worth it.’</p>

      <p>He fled in a hospital gown and handcuffs, but had managed to remain below police’s radar until he was finally apprehended Sunday.</p>
      <p>The suspect had been arrested on charges including statutory rape and sexual assault of a child when he began to complain of back pain and breathing difficulties.</p>
      <p>He fled shortly after being discharged, while under police supervision.</p>
      <p>Further details on his alleged crimes and underage victim have not been released by police.</p>
      <p>Vinton, who also faces drug and fraud charges, was later handed over to police, and is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail.</p>
