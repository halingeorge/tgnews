      <h1>Ballarat's Trent Bunney denied bail, accused of crashing stolen ute</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Ford</a></address>
      <p>A man who was only released from prison two weeks ago is now on remand after he was denied bail for allegedly crashing a stolen ute.</p>
      <p>Trent Bunney, 27, appeared at the Ballarat Magistrates' Court on Monday, representing himself from the dock.</p>
      <p>The court was told Bunney was arrested after police followed grind marks on the road from a crash in Sebastopol on Saturday - a parked four-wheel-drive was left with "extensive damage" and had moved about five metres.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said they saw the ute drifting onto the centre median before hitting the parked car and losing its front left wheel, then driving off.</p>
      <p>Police arrived at a Sebastopol address to find Bunney and a co-accused allegedly attempting to attach a new wheel to the ute.</p>
      <p>Two different number plates, also allegedly stolen, were found in the back.</p>
      <p>Bunney's jacket was searched, and police allege they found nine Xanax pills and a "modified torch", which could act like a Taser.</p>
      <p>The informant, Senior Constable Rory Mitchell, told the court Bunney had just served a 22-month sentence for similar offences, and had a history of serious offending.</p>
      <p>"(He) immediately returned to his offending ways," he said.</p>
      <p>Bunney challenged Senior Constable Mitchell to provide any evidence of him being in the car.</p>
      <p>"We were looking for two Caucasian males, one with white jacket, and you had a white jacket with you," Senior Constable Mitchell replied.</p>
      <p>He also asked if there was any forensic evidence - a search had not yet been completed - and why there was no police interview recorded - Senior Constable Mitchell replied Bunney was incoherent at the time of his arrest.</p>
      <p>Bunney told the court he had not been involved in any offending since his release, and had been concentrating on the Reconnect program.</p>
      <p>"That's the first time I've had help in the community, it's helping me with my mental health," he said.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Gregory Robinson said Bunney presented an unacceptable risk to the community.</p>
      <p>"Given the motor vehicle theft and accident and drug use, by themselves they are sufficient," he said.</p>
      <p>"The circumstantial evidence is strong that you were in the stolen vehicle at the time of the accident and then drove off."</p>
      <p>Bunney will appear again on November 25.</p>
