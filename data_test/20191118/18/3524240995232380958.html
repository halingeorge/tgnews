        <b>James Abraham, Jos</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Plateau State High Court sitting in Jos on Monday granted a former Governor of Plateau State, Jonah Jang, 14-day leave to file his no-case submission.</p>
      <p>Jang and a former cashier in the office of the Secretary to the State Government, Yusuf Pam, are being tried on 17 amended charges by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission bordering on alleged corruption and money laundering amounting to over 6.3bn during his tenure as governor</p>
      <p>Both Jang and Pam pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
      <p>Following the closure of the prosecution case after calling over 12 witnesses, Jang through his lead counsel, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), told the court on Monday that he was going to make a no-case submission stating that all the witnesses and documents exonerated his clientÂ (Jang) from financial misdeeds.</p>
      <p>Ozekhome said that no case has been established against Jang to warrant his indictment by the court.</p>
      <p>He told the court that they needed 14 days to write the formal no-case submission because of the volume of exhibits and documents tendered at the proceedings which they have to go through.</p>
      <p>Before adjourning the matter to December 17,2019 for adoption of the no-case submission which the counsel to the second accused, Mr. Samuel Adeniyi Oguntuyi, also associated himself with, the trial judge, Mr. Justice Daniel Longji granted the first and second defendants 14 days to file the no-case submission while the prosecution was given 10 days to file composite response.</p>
