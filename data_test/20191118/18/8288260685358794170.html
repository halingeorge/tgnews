      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news includes what McGinn said after a move fell through prior to AVFC switch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:31:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Hibernian’s sporting director has revealed John McGinn’s brilliant reaction to a failed transfer prior to signing for Aston Villa.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">McGinn</a> joined <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> in the summer of 2018 and ranks as one of the club's best bargains in recent years having been snapped up for under £3m.</p>
      <p>The midfielder played a starring role in the Championship promotion campaign and has continued to impress in the Premier League for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith’s</a> side.</p>
      <p>But it might have been very different had Hibs not shown such steely resolve in the face of interest from Nottingham Forest beforehand.</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa - End of Decade</h3>

      <p>There's been some lowlights, and a smattering of highlights from January 2010 to now - and we'll bring you a host of them here.</p>

      <p>The Championship side tried to prise McGinn away from Easter Road two years ago but failed to agree a fee with Hibs.</p>
      <p>Now, the Scottish Premiership club’s sporting director Graeme Mathie has spoken about what happened in more detail.</p>
      <p>Mathie revealed Forest were offering ‘four or five times’ McGinn’s wages at Hibs – and also opened up on how he reacted when the proposed deal fell through.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I'll never forget the text he (McGinn) sent back," Mathie told <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/making-john-mcginn-how-aston-20905748">the Daily Record.</a></p>
      <p>"He came back and said: 'Look, I get it, this is football, it's no problem at all. I'm loving being at Hibs and I want to have the best season of my career and hopefully get a move to a good club'.</p>
      <p>"Let's be honest, while John was committed to Hibs, somebody was potentially offering to give him four or five times his money to take him to the English Championship and us, as a club, had said no to that.</p>
      <p>"I thought that was an unbelievable thing for a young man to say."</p>
