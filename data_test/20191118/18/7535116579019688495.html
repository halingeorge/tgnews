      <p>Car safety is such an important feature, but we have to admit that we do overlook it sometimes. Especially with small children. It’s mandatory for passengers both in the front AND back to wear seatbelts, but how many of us are actually following the rule?</p>
      <p>This horrifying video below shows how an accident that happened on Kilometre 155.4 on the Lebuhraya Utara Selatan heading north near Jawi that could’ve ended with dire consequences, but thankfully didn’t.</p>

      <p>The video shows a red Proton Waja suddenly losing control and ramming onto a Honda City car which immediately skidded into the barrier tat the side of the road. The scariest part is that two kids can be seen being thrown out of the car. Thankfully, despite being thrown out towards the barricade, the kids were miraculously unhurt. The mom immediately rushed out of the car to see her kids and hugged them in relief upon seeing that they weren’t badly injured.</p>
      <p>The mom, Norseha Abdullah, 44, told <a href="https://www.hmetro.com.my/utama/2019/11/518334/ya-allah-anak-aku">Harian Metro</a> that she was talking to her daughter who was in the co-pilot seat when she saw the shadow of a red car passing in the corner of her eye, and they were rammed suddenly.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“My both kids are extremely traumatised and they’re both not talking like normal.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Waja was driven by a woman with her twin daughters who lost control for no apparent reason in the middle of the road. Initial assumptions were that her tyres exploded but investigations confirmed that this wasn’t the case. She had some light injuries to her neck and left leg while her kids were uninjured. A summons has been issued to the driver and Seberang Perai District Chief Police said that as of now investigations are still being conducted.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Danger is unpredictable and worse, it’s inevitable. The best thing we can do is to always be cautious and take careful steps all the time.</i>
