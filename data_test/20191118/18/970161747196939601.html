      <h1>Prince Andrew reminded us that powerful men are always protected</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T18:55:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/mandu-reid/" target="_blank">Mandu Reid</a></address>
      <p>Saturday night’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">‘testimony’ from </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>, so easily extracted by Emily Maitlis on BBC Newsnight, once again lifted the veil on how pervasive the culture of ‘impunity for the powerful’ is in relation to sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>It also proved that despite global movements like #MeToo, we are still at base camp at the foot of the mountain we have to climb to address sexual abuse, harassment and male violence against women and girls.</p>
      <p>Barely into the painful hour, it became clear that Prince Andrew, one of the most senior members of the royal family, perceives himself as the victim in all of this. He only remained friendly with Jeffrey Epstein because of his business connections. He only stayed in one of his properties because it was convenient. He only travelled to New York to end a friendship with a convicted sex offender because that was the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The way in which he framed his own response (or lack thereof) to Epstein’s crimes as ‘honourable’, while the strongest condemnation he could offer was to describe Epstein’s behaviour as ‘unbecoming’, speaks volumes.</p>

      <p>At no point does Prince Andrew show any empathy or compassion for his friend’s victims. Not once. Not even when Maitlis asks him whether he would like to add anything at the end of the piece.</p>
      <p>Instead, he states that he doesn’t regret his friendship with Epstein – a man who trafficked underage girls for the sexual pleasure of powerful men. What message does this send to the many thousands of women and girls who have been sexually exploited or abused in this country?</p>
      <p>However, something positive has come out of all of this, and I am grateful to Emily Maitlis’s careful questioning for eliciting Prince Andrew’s stumbling answers.</p>
      <p>Since the #MeToo movement went viral just over two years ago, it has been difficult to take the public narrative beyond the stories of individual victims, and take a real look at how and why abuse continues to happen.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Saturday’s interview marked a step change. It has proved just how powerful the structures that allow abuse to happen time and time again are, and how easy it is to distance oneself from, cover up, deny, and close down accusations.</p>
      <p>This societal norm, which rewards men with money and power, is a system that not only legitimises, but also hides, sexual abuse. A system which coddles the powerful and allows alleged perpetrators and enablers to evade proper scrutiny – while simultaneously stigmatising, silencing, and undermining those who make allegations.</p>
      <p>A system where, if outed, the men involved can, and do, react without any contrition, and instead portray themselves as hapless martyrs.</p>
      <p>Until we acknowledge these systems and work to correct and rebuild them, we will not move forward. The same stories will continue to crop up, time and time again, with those in power doing as they wish, without repercussions.</p>
      <p>At a time that the number of people prosecuted for rape in England and Wales has slumped to an all-time low, sitting at a measly 1.7 per cent, despite a surge in the number of cases, and when 20 per cent of women have experienced some type of sexual assault since the age of 16 (3.4million girls and women), it is so important the powerful are held to account.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Without this, the lack of faith women already have in the system will persist – stopping them from coming forward and getting the justice they deserve.</p>
      <p>This is why this general election, the Women’s Equality Party fielded five women who are incredible campaigners as well as survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault against male MPs with unresolved allegations of violence or harassment against them (some on multiple occasions).</p>
      <p>We did this to highlight the systems that enabled and protected these MPs from scrutiny. Whether the parties that closed ranks to protect and defend them, or regulations that make the media skittish about reporting details of allegations.</p>
      <p>We must banish this culture of impunity. Anything less amounts to a betrayal of women and girls and does a disservice to us all.</p>
