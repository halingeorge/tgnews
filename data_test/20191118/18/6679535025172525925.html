      <h2>‘This will help break the rigidity of police-public relations’</h2>

      <p>The city police have taken to sports to bond with the public. As part of its community policing initiative, they have announced a city-level Police Cup for cricket and kabaddi in December.</p>
      <p>The matches will be played at the police station level, providing a platform to break the rigidity of police-public relations, city Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao said.</p>
      <p>The police will invite teams from Resident Welfare Associations, apartment complexes, IT companies, industries, NGOs, and other government organisations, including police teams, for the tournament. After the initial round of matches, the winner and two runner-up teams will be selected from every sub-division — a set of four to five police stations — who will face off at a city-level tournament during December 19 to 22.</p>
      <p>Both sports will have separate women’s teams as well. The zonal Deputy Commissioners will be in-charge of the tournaments in their zones, including invitation to teams for the tournament.</p>
      <p>Hemanth Nimbalkar, Additional Commissioner (administration) and nodal-officer for community policing in the city, said: “The police-community relations are usually marred by fear and distrust. These sports tournaments will bring the police and the communities together at a more informal level, which will help the communities familiarise with their officers, humanise them and hopefully help bridge the trust deficit.”</p>
      <p>Holding sports tournaments has been a tried and tested method to organise people and bring about community participation, especially followed by several politicians who organise cricket and volleyball tournaments in the city.</p>
      <p>Former DGP S.T. Ramesh, who has been working on community policing initiatives in the city, said any informal interface between the police and the public was a step in the right direction as it had great potential.</p>
      <p>However, Mr. Ramesh added that it was only effective service delivery and humane interface with the public that will earn the police respect in the long run.</p>
