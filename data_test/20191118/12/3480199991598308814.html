      <p>Glastonbury’s greatest headliners have often brought controversy with them.</p>
      <p>Each year the news of who will take to the Pyramid Stage is met with wild celebrations or deep groans.</p>
      <p>One thing is for certain – the Somerset festival’s organisers are not afraid to take risks, last year booking grime figurehead Stormzy despite the then 25-year-old only having released one album.</p>
      <p>Here the PA news agency runs down 10 of the festival’s biggest and most controversial headliners.</p>
      <p>
        <b>T Rex in 1970</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Marc Bolan made an entrance as he christened the first edition of Glastonbury with a storming set on the event’s then much smaller main stage.</p>
      <p>In the time-honoured fashion of headliners dropping out at the last minute, T Rex had themselves stepped up to replace The Kinks.</p>
      <p>Bolan arrived at Worthy Farm in a Cadillac so large it barely fitted down the property’s narrow lane.</p>
      <p>The festival’s founder, Michael Eavis, told the NME that the late star’s performance “remains one of the most memorable slots ever at the festival”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pulp in 1995</b>

      <p>Carrying on the tradition of last-minute no shows, the Stone Roses were forced to pull out when guitarist John Squire broke his collarbone on a bike ride.</p>
      <p>Jarvis Cocker and his oddball crew were on hand to step in as Britpop’s popularity peaked.</p>
      <p>Primal Scream, Blur and even Rod Stewart were approached by the Eavis family but Cocker struck lucky.</p>
      <p>Pulp did not fail to impress, crowning their set with the now-ubiquitous Common People.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Radiohead in 1997</b>

      <p>Hot from the release of their revered third album, OK Computer, the Oxfordshire band were in fine form as they took to the Pyramid Stage.</p>
      <p>Heavy rain blighted – or added drama to – their performance.</p>
      <p>They tore through songs from Pablo Honey, The Bends and the most recent addition to their fast-growing back catalogue.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David Bowie in 2000</b>
      </p>

      <p>Bowie played at the second Glastonbury in 1971, and often recalled how he roused the audience with a late-night rendition of Oh! You Pretty Things.</p>
      <p>He returned in 2000, this time as a bona fide rock star with a back catalogue to match.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jay-Z in 2008</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Jay-Z’s booking in 2008 caused controversy (Yui Mok/PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The New York rapper’s notorious headline slot proved hip hop could fill the top slot with ease.</p>
      <p>Noel Gallagher was famously riled by the booking, saying at the time: “Glastonbury has the tradition of guitar music. I’m not having hip hop at Glastonbury. It’s wrong.”</p>
      <p>But Jay-Z arrived on stage brandishing a guitar and opened his set with a cover of Oasis’s Wonderwall, a knowing wink to the nay-sayers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Beyonce in 2011</b>
      </p>

      <p>In a performance only bested by her own 2018 slot at Coachella, Beyonce brought her A-game to Glastonbury.</p>
      <p>While still controversial, her show attracted less negative attention than her husband Jay-Z’s.</p>
      <p>And like him, she exceeded expectations with a show-stopping performance including tracks such as Crazy In Love and Single Ladies.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Rolling Stones in 2013</b>
      </p>

      <p>“After all these years they finally got round to asking us,” quipped Mick Jagger as he strolled on stage to the roar of 100,000 fans.</p>
      <p>Of course, Glastonbury’s organisers had been asking the band to headline for years.</p>
      <p>But touring commitments and reported quarrels over their fee blocked the way.</p>
      <p>Their eventual performance was hailed a masterclass by critics, and showcased their energy, despite their advanced ages.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Metallica in 2014</b>

      <p>Glastonbury once again broke the mould in 2014, booking Metallica as the first heavy metal band to headline.</p>
      <p>Any scepticism was pushed aside by an opening salvo of hits before the band reached a crescendo with Enter Sandman.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kanye West in 2015</b>

        <figcaption>Kanye West’s turn in 2015 divided opinion (Yui Mok/PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Critics dubbed the US rapper’s performance a compelling but messy affair.</p>
      <p>West re-started his song Black Skinhead and forgot the lyrics to an impromptu version of Bohemian Rhapsody.</p>
      <p>He ended by repeatedly shouting: “I am the greatest living rock star on the planet.”</p>
      <p>Prior to him taking to the Pyramid Stage, a petition to stop him headlining had reached 55,000 signatures.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Adele in 2016</b>

      <p>Adele began with Hello and, from the moment she opened her mouth, she had everyone in the palm of her hand – despite dropping copious f-bombs.</p>
      <p>The Skyfall singer spoke for long periods between songs – at one point revealing she “had a Chinese and did the dishes” as she watched Muse’s headline set from her home the previous night.</p>
