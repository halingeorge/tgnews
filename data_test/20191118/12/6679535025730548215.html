      <h2>Re-surfacing work, at an estimated cost of ₹150 crore, will start on November 20.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:13:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Flight services from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. till March 28 stand cancelled at the Kochi Airport as the four-month-long runway re-surfacing work is set to start on November 20.</p>
      <p>Since almost all services have already been re-scheduled, the project period would see cancellation of only five services, a statement from the airport said on November 18.</p>
      <p>Cochin International Airport Ltd. (CIAL) had started the preparatory work for the project well in advance, thereby ensuring minimal cancellation of services, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The winter schedule, which became effective from the last week of October, has re-scheduled the services to the available operational time. Thus only one service in international sector — Maldives service operated by Spice Jet — and four services in the domestic sector stand affected.</p>
      <p>CIAL, the seventh busiest airport in the country handling 240 aircraft movements and 30,000 passengers a day, expects a rush in the early morning and early evening hours, as the operational time is set to decreses from 24 hours to 16 hours.</p>
      <p>In anticipation og the rush, it has decided to increase the check-in time to 3 hours for domestic passengers and 4 hours for international passengers, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The CISF, which manages airport security, has deployed 100 additional personnel raising their total strength to 950. It is set to deploy another 400 personnel in the weeks to come.</p>
      <p>The re-surfing project, being done in an area of five lakh square meter, is estimated to be completed at a cost of ₹150 crore.</p>
