      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:04:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Porter, Business Insider US</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>On Saturday, Democrat John Bel Edwards claimed a narrow victory over his Republican rival Eddy Rispone in the race for Louisiana governor.</li>
        <li>Key to the Democratic victory was strong support in traditionally conservative suburban areas, such as Jefferson Parish outside New Orleans.</li>
        <li>The result underlines a growing trend of suburban areas swinging to vote for the Democrats, which was key to recent victories for the party in the southern states of Kentucky and Virginia.</li>
        <li>The Democratic victory came despite Trump having personally campaigned for Republican candidate Eddy Rispone.</li>
        <li>Tim Miller, a Republican strategist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/us/politics/louisiana-governor-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">told the New York Times</a> that the result is proof President Donald Trump is “human repellent spray for suburban voters who have a conservative disposition.”</li>

      <p>For the second time in weeks, President Donald Trump’s personal bid to lift a Republican candidate to victory in a closely fought gubernatorial race failed.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/louisiana-governor-live-election-results-bel-edwards-rispone-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">socially conservative Democrat John Bel Edwards won his reelection</a> bid in the deep red-state of Louisiana, beating Republican challenger Eddy Rispone with 51% of the vote to 49%.</p>
      <p>It came soon after a Democratic victory in another tightly fought election in a southern state, when the party’s candidate, Andy Beshear, won the Kentucky gubernatorial race.</p>
      <p>The results underscore some worrying trends for Republicans.</p>

      <p>They’ve exposed the limits of Trump’s personal capacity to help Republican candidates win, as in both cases the president campaigned hard for the losing GOP candidate.</p>
      <p>And they show that support from a key demographic of Republican voters – those living in the suburbs of major cities – may be waning.</p>
      <p>In Jefferson Parish, the most populous of the suburban New Orleans parishes, Edwards took 60% of the vote – <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/1117/Lessons-from-Louisiana-for-Democrats-and-Republicans">reported the Associated Press –</a> with only half of the voters who’d backed Trump in 2016 backing the GOP candidate. In 2016, Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton took only 41% of the vote.</p>
      <p>In partly urban and partly suburban east Baton Rouge, Edwards took 66% of the vote, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/17/politics/john-bel-edwards-louisiana-governor-republicans-election/index.html">reported CNN. This is a significant increase on the 52% of the vote Clinton won in 2016.</a></p>
      <p>Also key to the victory was strong turnout by African-American voters in urban areas.</p>
      <p>In Kentucky on November 5, Democrat Beshear <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kentucky-governor-election-2019-live-results-vote-count-beshear-bevin-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">won in large part</a> thanks to strong support in suburban areas.</p>
      <p>The results mirror those in the 2018 midterms, when Democrats seized back control of the House of Representatives partly by winning suburban areas in states including Pennsylvania, and Illinois. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-should-worry-about-swing-state-suburbs-in-2020-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Recent further gains</a> for Democrats in Pennsylvania compound the trend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/virginia-elections.html">A shift to the Democrats in the suburbs also defined the early November state</a> legislature elections in Virginia, in which Democrats claimed control of each of the state’s legislative bodies, flipping a series of traditionally Republican seats.</p>

      <p>“If you had any doubt that Trump was a human repellent spray for suburban voters who have a conservative disposition, Republicans getting wiped out in the suburbs of New Orleans, Louisville and Lexington should remove it,” Tim Miller, a Republican strategist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/us/politics/louisiana-governor-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">told The New York Times.</a></p>
      <p>Though neither Kentucky nor Louisiana are likely to vote for a Democratic president in next year’s election, this growing national trend will likely cause alarm to Republicans, as it could be a key factor in races in swing states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina.</p>
      <p>“They continue to lose needed support in suburban districts, especially among women and college-educated voters,” Republican strategist Rick Tyler told <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/06/suburban-voters-trump-losing-election-results-2019/">Fortune in early November.</a></p>
      <p>“That trend, if not reversed, is a death spiral.”</p>
