        <b>Photos of a ‘sweaty’ Prince Andrew appear to contradict claims made by the royal during a BBC interview that was roundly condemned as a PR disaster.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Duke of York was attempting to rebut allegations that his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein included the provision of trafficked underage girls, including Virginia Roberts-Giuffre who was 17 at the time she alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her.</p>
      <p>The royal attempted to debunk one of Roberts-Giuffre’s claims, that he was sweating profusely during a dance between the two at a London nightclub, by claiming that he had suffered a medical condition which prevented him from sweating.</p>

      <p>“There’s a slight problem with the sweating because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time…because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falkland’s War when I was shot at and it was almost impossible for me to sweat,” said the prince.</p>
      <p>However, several photos from the time clearly show the Duke of York sweating profusely, while others published by the Daily Mail contradict the royal’s claim that he rarely partied.</p>

      <p>The royal also suggested that a photo of him with his arm around Roberts-Giuffre could have been faked because he rarely displayed physical affection, a claim which is again contradicted by numerous other photos.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, during his claim that he had no recollection of meeting Roberts-Giuffre, the Duke blinked no less than ten times in the space of ten seconds while making the denial.</p>
      <p>According to numerous scientific studies, including one published by the Journal of Non-verbal Behaviour, rapid blinking is a reliable indicator that a person is lying.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The overwhelming consensus after the interview was that it was a PR disaster and had only resulted in Prince Andrew looking more guilty.</p>
      <p>It has since emerged that the Duke’s PR adviser quit two weeks ago after warning him not to do the interview.</p>
