      <h1>A Dubai bar is giving women free drinks based on their weight</h1>

      <p>Fusion Club in Dubai has gone viral due to a very unusual happy hour offer.</p>
      <p>The bar, located at the four-star Cassells Al Barsha Hotel, has introduced a promotion which offers women free drinks based on how much they weigh.</p>
      <p>The more they weigh, the more free drinks they can receive.</p>
      <p>A woman can either weigh herself on a scale near the entrance to the bar, or write her weight on a slip of paper and give it to the barman.</p>
      <p>One kilogram is equal to one United Arab Emirati Dirhams (AED). So, for example, if a woman weighs 60kg, she would get free drinks to the worth of 60 AED – which equates to around £12.60. The deal applies for all drinks.</p>

      <p>The bar says the offer is designed to show that ‘it’s good to gain weight’ – a motto that is splashed across the posters for the promotion, too.</p>

      <p>Vice president, Mr Baburaj, told Metro, ‘We believe in being different than the rest of the night Clubs and hotels in making our guests delighted. We wanted the ladies to surprise their partners and friends that it’s good to gain weight.</p>
      <p>‘We have different promotions at Fusion Club every month, which are often “crazy” and unique and are enjoyed by both men and women. ‘</p>
      <p>He added, ‘Dubai is a city for entertainment and fun.</p>
      <p>‘We never ask any women to check their weight, we trust them and just serve whatever number they wrote on the paper without asking any questions and therefore we don’t see any reason to feel having bad intention about the offer’</p>
      <p>But the happy hour offer has attracted a mixed response from Dubai residents, with some claiming that the deal promotes obesity.</p>

      <p>One said on Twitter: ‘This is just stupid, and FYI it promotes fat gain and obesity… like the fatter you are the more we’ll allow you to consume empty calories which, in turn, will make you… even fatter?’</p>
      <p>But the bar says the deal has been met with a positive reaction, so much so that it has led to an extension.</p>
      <p>The promotion was due to end in August, but has since been extended to run until December.</p>
