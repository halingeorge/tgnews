      <h3>Knife control?</h3>
      <p>The axe, hammer, crowbar, knife and gun are common tools used on prairie farms, all of which can kill. In Canada, 37.8 per cent of the homicides are stabbings and 31.2 per cent are shootings (NP, Nov 27, 2015).</p>
      <p>The Liberal government during the implementation and introduction of Bill C-68 (gun control) in 1995 spent millions of taxpayers’ dollars to make all law-abiding gun owners look bad. Canadian citizens who do not understand legal hunting and shooting sports soon became prejudiced against legal gun owners.</p>
      <p>It would be more logical for the Liberals to have knife control where every man, woman, and child would have to take an eight-hour course, pass a practical and written test (80 per cent) then buy a licence to be permitted to handle and buy knives; however, this would be as stupid as gun control.</p>
      <p>Successive Liberal governments have gone after the law-abiding gun owner rather than the criminals. The Liberal motto since the 1982 Bill of Rights has been “soft on crime and tough on legal gun owners.” Before Bill C-68, you couldn’t find an unregistered restricted handgun, and now they’re easily available.</p>
      <p>A lot of police would like guns taken away because they feel they would have an advantage. The fact that the RCMP have to enforce gun laws makes people very untrusting of law enforcement. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/moe-scheer-line-up-against-proposed-handgun-ban">If the Liberal government decides to ban handguns</a>, it will leave handguns only in the hands of criminals and the police.</p>

        <b>Climate change denial is misleading</b>
      </p>
      <p>Multiple peer-reviewed studies have looked at the scientific literature and concluded that at least 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming.</p>
      <p>Climate scientists have given us clear warnings that we must act urgently to avoid widespread catastrophe. As such, it is unacceptable and dangerous to have members of our Legislative Assembly calling climate change a hoax or saying that those who recognize the scientific consensus “can go back to the Flat Earth Society,” while dismissing those concerned about climate change as “the end-of-the-world-crowd.”</p>
      <p>However, those are <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/mandryk-moe-may-be-listening-to-too-many-angry-backbenchers-offering-little">recent comments from Sask. Party MLAs Warren Michelson and Hugh Nerlien</a>.</p>
      <p>I can understand members of the public being confused about climate change, given that companies have poured millions of dollars into deceiving people. The misinformation and manipulation of the climate change denial movement has now been well documented.</p>
      <p>Nerlien and Michelson are not simply members of the public, though. As MLAs, they are responsible to respect the rights of everyone in our society, including the rights of the children who will live with the consequences of their actions.</p>
      <p>We cannot afford to have our climate policies being determined by those who get their scientific information from conspiracy theory websites. Their remarks present a clear call to look seriously at Sask. Party climate policies. How could those policies possibly be sufficient if climate change deniers feel at home in that party and if the party has not even denounced their remarks?</p>
