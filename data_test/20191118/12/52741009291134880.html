      <p>ADEN, Yemen — Yemen’s internationally recognized government has returned to the country for the first time since it was forced out by southern separatists during infighting last summer.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed landed on Monday in the southern port city of Aden, fulfilling a key point in the power-sharing deal signed in Saudi Arabia that ended months of infighting.</p>
      <p>The government had been slated to return last Tuesday but officials said the separatists were stalling and refusing to handover the key headquarters building and the presidential palace.</p>
      <p>In August, the ousted secessionists, backed by the United Arab Emirates, ousted President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi’s forces, setting off violence between the two side.</p>
      <p>The government and the separatists are nominal partners in the Saudi-led coalition’s war against Iran-allied Houthi rebels.</p>
