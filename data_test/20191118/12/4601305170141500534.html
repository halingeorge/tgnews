      <p>Brilliant fun <a href="http://erickissack.com/#/thegunfighter/">from Kevin Tenglin and Erik Kissack</a> featuring Nick Offernan as a narrator with entirely too much influence over proceedings and Shawn Parsons as a hapless gunslinger. A <a href="https://youtu.be/FBJlVlugZYc">16:9 version</a> is on YouTube.</p>
      <blockquote>Filmmaker Eric Kissack tells the story of a lone gunslinger who walks into a saloon and begins to hear a voice -- the all-knowing narrator.<br/><br/>In a small town in the Old West, a weary man enters the room. Suddenly, an omniscient voice begins to narrate the scene, revealing who the gunslinger is and what he's about to do.<br/><br/>But the characters in the film can hear the voice, too.<br/><br/>The narrator quickly divulges the deepest, darkest secrets of the people in the saloon. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the narrator wants nothing more than to see a "ballet of death."<br/><br/>Featuring the mellifluous voice of comedian Nick Offerman.</blockquote>
