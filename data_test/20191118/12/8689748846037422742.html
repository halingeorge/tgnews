      <p>There’s often a myth associated with Krobos which has been passed on from generation to generation. The Krobo people are an ethnic group in Ghana.</p>
      <p>They are grouped as part of Ga-Adangbe ethnolinguistic group and they are also the largest group of the seven Dangme ethnic groups of Southeastern Ghana.</p>
      <p>The Krobo are a farming people who occupy Accra Plains, Akuapem Mountains and the Afram Basin.</p>
      <p>According to a popular legend, they love sekz a lot and are very good in bed too. This was confirmed by TV personality and marriage counselor, Joyce Akumaa Dongotey-Padi popularly known as Akumaa Mama Zimbi.</p>
      <p>Mama Zimbi told Andy Dosty on Hitz FM that her people (she’s a Krobo, don’t forget) are great cooks and ‘dribblers’ I’m bed as well.</p>
      <p>“<b>We as Krobo are taught how to have sex, and that’s why Krobo ladies are so good in bed. We know how to cook, we are good cooks. We were taught how to keep ourselves. Get a Krobo lady.”</b></p>
