      <p>LONDON, Nov 18 — China’s ambassador to the United Kingdom today dismissed reporting by Western media on the Chinese government’s policies in Xinjiang as “pure fabrication” and “fake news”.</p>
      <p>United Nations experts and activists say at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in the western Xinjiang region in a crackdown that has drawn condemnation from the United States and other countries.</p>
      <p>Beijing denies any mistreatment of the Uighurs or others in Xinjiang and says it is providing vocational training to help stamp out Islamic extremism and separatism and teach new skills.</p>
      <p>Asked in London about a <i>New York Times</i> article based on leaked Chinese government documents the newspaper said revealed details of the clampdown in Xinjiang, the diplomat said: “I can categorically deny there is such a document. It is sheer, pure fabrication.” — Reuters</p>
