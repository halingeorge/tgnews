      <h1>New Lifestyle Estate East London: Secure Country Living In The City</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:43:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/neelket/" target="_blank">NT Editor</a></address>
      <p>Even prior to launch later this month (November 2019), a sizeable, new upmarket lifestyle estate called Toboshane Valley Estate, situated in a picturesque natural setting in Dorchester Heights in East London, is attracting keen interest from buyers and investors, with 27 plots already reserved.</p>
      <p>The developers, MW Properties and SKG, both have vast experience in property development – MW Properties having successfully completed Bishops Country Estate in East London and various other upmarket lifestyle estates, and SKG who have huge property development experience throughout South Africa. Exclusively marketed through Pam Golding Properties, the Toboshane development company was formed with a vision to offer exclusive estate living in a secure, country environment close to all amenities within the urban edge of the city.</p>
      <p>Says Sean Coetzee, Pam Golding Properties area principal in East London: “With 208 separate title stands coming online in the next three years, the location is prime – alongside the meandering Nahoon River, yet only 2km from Hemingways Shopping Mall, 6km from popular schools and Life Beacon Bay Hospital and 8km from Nahoon Beach.</p>
      <p>“Combining the charm of the countryside with modern living and luxury amenities, adding to the appeal is the fact that there is a relative lack of residential development in East London when compared to cities such as Port Elizabeth, resulting in a pent-up demand, especially for a luxury lifestyle estate which offers secure living and peace of mind.</p>
      <p>“This development is ideal for up-and-coming young families who are looking to provide a safe, play-filled and unspoilt, natural environment for their children as well as the more mature buyer who seeks to escape the bustle of city life and live in a countrified environment with scenic, tranquil views.”</p>
      <p>Set on 850ha of land rich in vegetation and wildlife, the separate title stands comprise 196 erven of 1 000sqm and another 12 erven of 600sqm at prices starting from R850 000, while plot and plan options start from R2.4 million with 11 house plans to choose from. For those who wish to design their own homes, the development guidelines direct the architectural vision of the estate.</p>
      <p>Adds Coetzee: “Installation of infrastructure should commence within two years. Each house will have its own garages and parking area, with communal parking also available. The entire estate will have security perimeter fencing, controlled access and 24 hour patrols.”</p>
      <p>Numerous amenities will include a clubhouse, gym, two tennis courts, horse stabling, fishing and recreational dams, picnic/camping spots, hiking and cycle trails and game and bird viewing.</p>
      <p>The development is named after the Toboshane River, a Nahoon River tributary which runs through the estate.</p>
