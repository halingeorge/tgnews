      <p>If going by the calendar, Black Friday is about a week and a half away. The deals have already started to <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/best-buy-black-friday">trickle out</a>, and we suspect as Thursday, November 28 gets even closer in view, more bargains will make early debuts. In the meantime, companies have started previewing upcoming Black Friday discounts, including <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google">Google</a>, which will be offering a range of gadgets on sale.<br/><br/>One of the highlights is a $200 discount on unlocked <a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_4"><b>Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</b></a> models. The slashed pricing will actually go into effect on Sunday, November 24, bringing the cost of entry down from $799 to $599 for the Pixel 4, and from $899 to $699 for the Pixel 4 XL. This presumably will apply to all three color options, those being Clearly White, Just Black, and Oh So Orange.<br/><br/>The other early bargain applies to the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate?hl=en-US"><b>Pixel Slate</b></a>. Users will be able to save up to $648 on the Pixel Slate and select accessories. Starting on Sunday, November 24, it looks like the baseline model will drop in price from $799 to $449. That's the version with an 8th generation Intel Core m3-8100Y processor, 8GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. The more powerful configurations will likely drop in price as well.</p>
