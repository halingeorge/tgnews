      <h1>Fury as Black Country Christmas lights switch-on ends in chaos</h1>
      <h2>Families were “crushed” during overcrowding at a Christmas lights switch-on, it has been claimed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:40:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/jamie-brassington/" target="_blank">Jamie Brassington</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of people, including those with young children, attended the Blackheath switch on event on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>But organisers were left facing criticism over management of the event by hundreds of people who took to Facebook over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Event organiser Walk Works CIC, which has managed the event for three years, said the switch-on was scaled back this year.</p>
      <p>Sandwell Council cut the budget for festive events across the borough this year including the costs of Christmas trees.</p>
      <p>The authority has apologised that the event "fell well short" of expectations.</p>
      <p>Blackheath ward councillor Kerrie Carmichael said the event was "very crowded" with the event made "60 per cent smaller".</p>
      <p>The event attracted a similar crowd from 2018, which is around 6,000 people.</p>
      <p>Members of the public slammed Sandwell Council on Facebook, branding the event "car crash" and an "utter disgrace".</p>
      <p>Councillor Maria Crompton, cabinet member for safety communities, said a debrief will be taking place in light of complaints.</p>

      <p>Writing on the council's Facebook page, Samantha Crumpton said: "I actually thought me and my baby was going to die at one point!</p>
      <p>"We were getting crushed and pushed and I looked around with no way out of the crowd.</p>
      <p>"It was horrible and stressful and couldn’t even see the lights turn on! Terrible organisation. I go every year!"</p>
      <p>Julie Ann Finch said: "My kids got stuck by the stage getting crushed. We couldn't move.</p>
      <p>"I had to hold my seven-year-old in the air. How dare you put our safety at risk! Never again you - should be ashamed of yourselves!"</p>
      <h3>'Disgrace'</h3>
      <p>Kel Thackery said: "Utter disgrace of a event. Talk about putting families in danger.</p>
      <p>"Not closing roads off, sticking it all in one tiny part of the street. Too many people crammed in a small space. You're actually breaking health and safety."</p>
      <p>Stacey Caffrey added: "Absolute car crash! Only half of the town closed off! Everybody squashed trying to see the stage!</p>
      <p>"The road wasn’t even closed off far enough to see the Christmas tree lights turn on! Next year close the whole town off as you have previously!"</p>
      <p>Money to organise the switch-on is taken out of an allowance called the Local Area Budget (LAB).</p>
      <p>This budget is also used by community organisations for events throughout the year.</p>
      <p>But there has been a cap placed on Christmas spending this year.</p>
      <p>In Blackheath and Cradley Heath, which shares the spending on Christmas events, the amount available has been reduced from £8,000 to £5,000.</p>
      <p>Councillor Carmichael said: "What happened was the budget was cut for the Christmas lights event.</p>
      <p>"Each town has an allowance to spend, but the allowance has been capped.</p>
      <h3>'Very crowded'</h3>
      <p>"Around 6,000 people attended the lights switch-on, but about 40 or 35 per cent of the high street was used from last year.</p>
      <p>"I was told people were having to lift pushchairs over other people, although I didn't see that myself.</p>
      <p>"It was very crowded and people couldn't get to the stage."</p>
      <p>The Christmas tree budget in Sandwell <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/sandwell/2019/09/05/bah-humbug-christmas-tree-cash-cut-after-ridiculous-6k-overspend/">was also reduced earlier this year from £16,000 to £10,000.</a></p>
      <p>Halesowen and Rowley Regis parliamentary candidate Ian Cooper, a former Sandwell Council officer who previously used to organise the event, said: "They have asked organisers to do the job with much fewer resources.</p>
      <p>"The decision to cut the funding was made by someone with no connection to Rowley Regis.</p>
      <p>"I'm told the police were consulted throughout the event. They said the event was safe and they would have shut down the event straight if it wasn't."</p>
      <p>Councillor Maria Crompton said the decision to cut the budget was made so more resources could be allocated to community organisations during the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>Walk Works CIC is understood to have been paid £2,000 to organise the event.</p>

      <p>Councillor Crumpton said: "The lights switch-on was very popular. We will have to have a debrief about this.</p>
      <p>"The money that pays for the Christmas lights event comes out of the LAB fund. This money goes to helping charities and organisations.</p>
      <p>"In past years, a huge chunk has been taken out of that budget for Christmas events, which should be given to organisations.</p>
      <p>"We put a cap on Christmas events which allowed for more LAB organisations to get more money throughout the year."</p>
      <p>She added: "Walk Works saw that the space had gotten smaller, there was fewer road closures, and knew what space we had.</p>
      <p>"They, therefore, should have tailored the event to fit that space. Obviously it did get overcrowded.</p>
      <p>"I am not saying anyone is to blame. We have got to have a debrief over what happened."</p>
      <p>In a statement, Walk Works, said: "This is our third year of organising Blackheath Christmas Lights Switch-on.</p>
      <p>"We had a conversation with Maria [Crompton] during peak attendance time, but no overcrowding issues were raised by her then.</p>
      <p>"We consulted and checked with police, security and first aiders numerous times during the event and they were happy with the how things were.</p>
      <p>"Prior to the event Walk Works attended a Sandwell Safety Advisory Group meeting where all risk assessments and insurances were approved.</p>
      <p>"The smaller footprint for the event was due to Sandwell Council cabinet decision to cut the Christmas budget.</p>
      <p>"We accommodated this by omitting the Christmas market stalls, Sandwell Youth Bus and street entertainment, there was a smaller funfair than usual."</p>
      <p>A Sandwell Council spokesman said: "We’ve received lots of complaints about Saturday’s Blackheath Christmas lights switch-on event.</p>
      <p>"We have arranged an urgent meeting with the organisers to discuss the concerns people have raised around safety and other matters.</p>
      <p>"We want these events to be a huge success for everybody to get into the Christmas spirit and we’re sorry to hear that this event fell well short of expectation.”</p>
