      <h4>The Kardashian and Jenner sisters are widely known for rocking a red carpet, but even when they are strutting down the pavement, they make their casual style a major fashion moment!</h4>
      <p>The KarJenner sisters have been serving looks ever since they first came on the scene! While their styles have transformed over time, one thing remains the same: they are always dressed for the occasion. Fans know that these women can hit a red carpet with some of the best, most daring looks we’ve seen. But even when <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/kim-kardashian/"><b>Kim Kardashian</b></a>, <b>Kourtney Kardashian</b>, <b>Khloe Kardashian</b>, <b>Kendall Jenner</b>, and <b>Kylie Jenner </b>are just out running errands or simply on the town, they still manage to pull together a fashionable frock.</p>
      <p>One of the many times the KarJenners strutted their stuff while rocking some semi-casual attire, was when Kim Kardashian wore a stunning black top and long black skirt while out in New York City on Oct. 24, 2019. The <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians </i>star looked positively radiant while <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/24/kim-kardashian-almost-has-wardrobe-malfunction-sexy-top-pic/">out and about</a> enjoying the fall weather. Kim, who held her phone in one hand while walking through the city, accessorized with subtle gold jewelry. Kim sported two lovely necklaces and one pinky ring while out and her hair was worn long and down with a pair of strappy heels to finish off the look!</p>
      <p>Naturally, Kim wasn’t the only who showed fans how to do street style with a fashionable flair. Kourtney was dressed to the nines while running errands on May 30, 2019 in Los Angeles. The mother-of-three looked positively flawless, wearing patterned <b>Asos</b> trousers and a tank top. Kourtney donned a pair of sunglasses for the bright, sunny summer day while carrying what appeared to be two green juices in her hands. That wasn’t all she was carrying, though. Kourtney finished off her look by toting a bag by <b>Hermes </b>that really brought the whole look together.</p>

      <p>While molding her own style and being inspired by her older sisters, Kendall is someone who always puts her own spin on street style. The supermodel turned the streets of New York into her own runway on June 17, 2019, wearing a stunning, <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/kendall-kylie-jenner-tight-dresses-pics-3642255/">body hugging</a> yellow <b>Bec And Bridge</b> dress with thin straps and a length that just hit her knees. Kendall looked drop dead gorgeous in the casual ensemble, and dressed up her look with a pair of strappy heels designed by <b>Amina Muaddi</b>.</p>
