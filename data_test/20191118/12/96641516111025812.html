      <p>We've described the Oculus Quest as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/30/oculus-quest-review-wireless-vr">best standalone wireless VR headset yet</a>, but there was one feature missing from the system: the ability to plug the headset into a PC. That feature is coming, with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/oculus-link-quest-rift-VR/">Oculus Link</a> software which is launching today in beta.</p>
      <p>With Oculus Link, Quest owners can access the entire library of Rift PC games via a USB-C cable. We tried out the Link feature at Oculus Connect 6 and were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/26/oculus-quest-link-hands-on-pc-vr/">impressed by the simplicity</a> of the setup: you just plug in the Quest and the Oculus Desktop software recognizes both the headset and the controllers.</p>
      <p>Once connected, you can use the Quest to play Rift games like <i>Asgard's Wrath</i> and <i>Stormland</i> much like you would on a Rift S. You can also purchase games through the Rift Store and access non-gaming features like the 3D-modelled Oculus Home and the Dash central hub.</p>
      <p>The Link software will work with most third-party cables, or you can wait for Oculus to release its own premium 5-meter-long cable with a right angle connector later this year.</p>
      <p>With the introduction of all these new features for the Quest, it can now do <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/oculus-rift-s-vs-quest/">practically everything the Rift S can do</a>. To try it for yourself, Oculus will be rolling out the Link software in beta mode starting today.</p>
