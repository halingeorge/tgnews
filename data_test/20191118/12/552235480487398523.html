      <p>A couple who lost 12 babies in three years told of their heartache - and called for more funding to be allocated for research into <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/family-kids/how-men-deal-trauma-miscarriage-20395054">miscarriages</a> .</p>
      <p>Amanda Gordon, 34, suffered a bilateral ectopic twin <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/rangers-star-alfredo-morelos-wife-20883496">pregnancy</a> last month, the odds of which were one in 100,000, according to medics.</p>
      <p>Tragically, she had been expecting <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=twins+daily+record&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enGB864GB864&amp;oq=twins+daily+record+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4479j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">twins</a> but each foetus was trapped in each of Amanda's fallopian tubes and she miscarried at six weeks.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The mum-of-four, from Dreghorn, North Ayrshire, told how after her 11th experience of miscarriage she had become 'nearly desensitised' to it.</p>
      <p>Amanda said: "We are sitting in that waiting room and because we have been here so many times before and it has been terrible news, you are almost expecting it.</p>
      <p>"It's horrific and when it was the first few times it took me so long to understand it and get over it.</p>
      <p>"Now we have lost two babies in our 11th pregnancy and we are still devastated but eventually you almost become desensitised in a way, because it is the worst possible news so at that point I know what has to happen next, so I just want to get it over with."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Her partner, Robert Beaton, described the experience as 'torture'.</p>
      <p>Robert said: "In the past three years we have been through torture.</p>
      <p>"This last time was really hard.</p>
      <p>"The doctors said it was a one in 100,000 chance of having a double ectopic pregnancy."</p>
      <p>Now the couple, who are also parents to twins Michael and Callum, 16, Erin, 14 and Darcy, nine, have launched a petition calling for more funding into NHS research on why miscarriages happen.</p>
      <p>Robert said "We have been through hell and we just feel like we need answers.</p>
      <p>"The care and treatment we have had from NHS staff has been exceptional.</p>
      <p>"We just can't fault it, but this issue is underfunded, we need to have more money invested into all types of baby loss so we can find out why this happens.</p>
      <p>"One in four pregnancies end in baby loss. I think that is a shocking number."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The couple are planning to send the petition, which has already gained more than 700 signatures, to cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, Jeane Freeman.</p>
      <p>Robert added: "If that petition can help get finding for research then we hope that more couples won't have to go through what we have."</p>
