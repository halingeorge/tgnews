      <p>Airbnb is becoming a worldwide Olympic partner in time for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo as the games' organisers bid to cut the costs associated with hosting the event.</p>
      <p>Airbnb said that the partnership with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would cover five Olympics and Paralympics over the next nine years. Alongside next year's Tokyo Olympic games this includes: the Beijing 2022, Paris 2024, Milan 2026 and LA 2028 winter and summer games. All are major rental hotspots for the accommodation platform.</p>
      <p>Details of the partnership were not disclosed, but the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d5e5684-09d0-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">reported the deal was set at $500 million,</a> citing sources briefed on the talks.</p>
      <p>IOC President Thomas Bach said that the partnership would not replace the Olympic village but would be based on a guarantee of accommodation for visitors, families of athletes, and officials, and would reduce the need for host cities to unsustainably invest in new hotels.</p>
      <p>"One of the goals of (our) agenda is to make the Olympic Games more feasible and more sustainable," Bach said at an event in London to announce the partnership.</p>
      <p>"There, this partnership will greatly help, because it will provide accommodation that will reduce the costs for the Olympic Games organisers and all the stakeholders."</p>
      <p>Locals staged protests at the last summer games in Rio de Janeiro because of the cost of hosting the event while Brazil was mired in recession.</p>
