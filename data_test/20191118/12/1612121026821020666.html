      <p>The November update has hit the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/xbox-one/">Xbox One</a> with the most notable change being Google Assistant’s voice controls moving from beta to full availability. We recently detailed all of the voice commands for <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/google-assistant/">Google Assistant</a> in beta (check them out <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/guides/beginner/xbox-google-assistant/">here</a>), and if you have a Google Assistant Home-enabled device, you can power the Xbox One on and off, and launch games, apps and videos with just your voice.</p>

      <p>Gamertag improvements for the console have also arrived, which comes after the PC update that added a new display option and 13 worldwide alphabets. Profiles, friends lists, messages, clubs and more are all supported. Players don’t have to do anything to keep their Xbox tag, either. Text filters have also been introduced, allowing players to customize what’s acceptable in text-based messages. Four filters are included, with <i>friendly</i> keeping everything clean to <i>medium</i>, <i>mature</i> and completely <i>unfiltered</i>. Players can still report messages that are in violation of the system’s community standards, regardless of the set filter. To configure these settings, go to Settings – General – Online safety &amp; family – Privacy &amp; online safety – Message safety.</p>

      <p>Mixer viewing improvements are also on board, allowing you to either hide Mixer chat or move it around the screen. Voice dictation has added new languages as well, including Spanish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Japanese and Simplified Chinese. The settings menu has been simplified and all new consoles can be customized via the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/xbox-app/">Xbox app</a> on Android or iOS – language, time zone, power settings, and more. This can be done while your Xbox is installing the latest update, saving valuable time.</p>
