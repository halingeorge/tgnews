      <p>If you have been asked to add keywords in your resume, chances are it’s words like ‘team player’, ‘quick learner’, ‘hard-working’. If yes, you are doing it all wrong. The trick to using keywords is to create a balance between right word choices and yet avoid cliches.</p>
      <p>Based on a report by Indeed, a job search platform, here is a list of top 10 keywords to avoid mentioning in your resume to get the right kind of attention.</p>

      <p>Sashi Kumar, Managing Director, Indeed India, said, “In order to ensure their story is heard in an increasingly crowded world of applicants, candidates are taking an active interest in storytelling, and rightly so, given that the average recruiter looks at a resume for only six seconds.”</p>
      <p>The problem is restricted not just to job-seekers, but employers as well. Data from Indeed indicates that the most commonly used term by Indian recruiters in job descriptors is ‘scalable’, followed by phrases such as ‘authentic’, ‘disruptive’, ‘evangelist’ and ‘value add’, used to describe the qualities expected in a potential employee.</p>
      <p>Here is a list of overused words by recruiters, which act as a hurdle in finding the right kind of talent.</p>
