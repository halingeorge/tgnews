      <p>Valve has spent nearly a decade perfecting indifference to everything that's expected of it as a game developer. Despite creating some of the most beloved franchises of all time, Valve has been content to simply quit making those games. <i>Portal 2</i> (2011) is the most recent singleplayer-focused title from Valve. People complain about sequel fatigue all the time; with Valve, they ravenously crave those very same sequels.</p>
      <p>We might get a sequel soon -- but in true Valve fashion, it doesn't come without twisting your emotions and tugging at your heartstrings. There are reports that a direct followup to <i>Half-Life 2</i> will be revealed this week (although it's not clear if it'll tell the story immediately after <i>Half-Life 2</i> or <i>Half-Life 2: Episode 2</i>). It's called <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> and it's a virtual reality game.</p>
      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will presumably take place from the perspective of deuteragonist Alyx Vance. There's no more information about this game apart from a vague and jumbled description that was reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rumour-valve-are-about-to-announce-a-vr-game-called-half-life-alyx/">PC Gamer</a>: "You can see their whole body -- Respond to the situation. You know, panicking, dropping clips on the ground as they fumble their weapons 'cause a zombie's in front of them, all these things, they're just -- it's been really fun watching playtests."</p>
      <p>Although many <i>many</i> people will be eager to get their hands on another official <i>Half-Life</i>, <i>Alyx</i> will be something few will find themselves equipped to play. It's said to be releasing for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-valve-index-556196.phtml">Valve Index</a>, which is Valve's new $1,000 VR headset (however, cheaper models are available). Valve had teased that it has a "flagship VR game" for Index in the pipeline. This is evidently it.</p>
      <p>There are two components to the rumor that <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will be announced soon. First, it's said that the unveiling will happen this week. Second, there are substantial reports that <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will receive screentime at December's Game Awards. A since-deleted script leaked from a Game Awards interview where Geoff Keighley interviews members of Valve. Keighley ends the segment by confirming <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will launch in March 2020.</p>
      <p>As for the obvious question that most people are wondering right now: No, there's not a good chance it'll be ported for non-VR use. That same leaked script includes a section where an unnamed Valve developer says "I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard, but like as we said, it began as an exploration of VR."</p>
      <p>Those who have patiently (and not-so-patiently) suffered through year after year without new <i>Half-Life</i> will have three options -- assuming this rumor comes to fruition. They can shell out big bucks for a Valve Index, they can simply not play it, or they can live it secondhand through a YouTube Let's Play. <i>Half-Life</i> fans know best that it's never easy being a <i>Half-Life</i> fan.</p>
