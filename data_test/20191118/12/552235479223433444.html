      <p>Dalbeattie is set for an affordable-housing boom.</p>
      <p>Loreburn Housing Association is looking at building nearly 30 units on two sites in the town.</p>
      <p>The social housing landlord’s plans are outlined in a report for a meeting of the council’s economy and resources committee on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They are looking to add two developments in the town to the local authority’s strategic housing investment plan (SHIP). The document is used by the Scottish Government when it comes to making decisions for affordable housing.</p>
      <p>One of the sites is the old Jewson’s builders’ merchants yard on Dalbeattie’s Station Road, which has lain empty for three years.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, planning permission in principle was given for 15 houses on the site, which is currently owned by Auchencairn-based IBF property Ltd.</p>
      <p>They also have planning permission for four industrial units on the site. The report for councillors shows Loreburn want to build 15 homes, which would add to one of their developments nearby.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Housing strategy co-ordinator Jamie Little says there “has been significant local support for bringing this vacant land back into use”.</p>
      <p>He adds that Loreburn are also looking at a site on Barhill Road, which has been allocated 30 units in the latest version of the council’s local development plan. That is being targeted for 12 affordable homes. Mr Little’s report says there are a number of requirements that need met to develop the site, including the need for a flood risk assessment.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the council’s economy and resources committee, Rob Davidson, said: “The delivery of the SHIP makes a significant contribution towards our council priorities: <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">to protect vulnerable people, provide the best start in life for all our children and build the local economy.”</a></p>
