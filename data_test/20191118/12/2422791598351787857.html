      <p>SYDNEY, Australia -- A prosecutor told an Australian court that actor Craig McLachlan kissed an actress's neck, stomach and buttocks more than 20 times during a scene in a stage musical in which he was meant to only simulate a sex act.</p>
      <p>Details of charges against the 54-year-old actor who starred in Australian soap operas "Neighbours" and "Home and Away" were aired in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>McLachlan is facing multiple charges, including counts of indecent assault, one of attempted indecent assault and others of assault, involving four complainants who worked with him on a production of "The Rocky Horror Show."</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Matt Fisher alleged McLachlan "went beyond the role he was directed to perform" in relation to the allegations, which McLachlan denies.</p>
