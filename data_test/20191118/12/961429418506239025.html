        <b>One of England’s largest clinical commissioning groups has increased its planned deficit by nearly £40m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devon CCG, formerly part of a “success regime”, is now forecasting a £66m deficit in 2019-20, despite initially targeting ending the year £27m in the red.</p>
      <p>The £1.2bn-income CCG broke even for the first time in its history in 2018-19, after it achieved a £25m deficit which unlocked £25m of commissioner sustainability funding.</p>
      <p>Devon’s problems are compounded by the “increasing expectation” that several of the county’s providers are at risk of missing their control totals, according to the CCG’s latest finance report.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Torbay and South Devon Foundation Trust, which was not part of the <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/first-three-troubled-areas-to-be-put-into-success-regime/5085532.article">success regime</a>, has expressed concern about a “top-down approach” by Devon’s sustainability and transformation partnership over the creation of a long-term financial plan.</p>
      <p>It comes just two months after <i>HSJ</i> revealed external consultants reported a <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/policy-and-regulation/learned-helplessness-and-crisis-mentality-prevalent-in-former-success-regime/7025819.article">culture of “learned helplessness” and “crisis mentality”</a> among Devon’s NHS leadership, with individual chiefs “retrenching” back into their organisations when faced with difficult decisions.</p>
      <h3><anchor name="Savings_plans"/>Savings plans</h3>
      <p>Devon’s STP initially forecast a deficit of £115m for 2019-20 against a control total of £43m. However, the area then went through an “intensive programme supported by NHS England/Improvement” to reach an “acceptable position”, according to Devon CCG’s <a href="https://devonccg.nhs.uk/documents?wpdmc=meeting-papers-and-minutes">board papers</a>.</p>
      <p>This resulted in the forecast deficit being reduced to £70m and was based on “accelerating” transformation programmes across Devon, with the CCG tasked with finding the extra £45m of savings required to hit it.</p>
      <p>This meant the CCG’s savings plan rose from £36m to £81m.</p>
      <p>The revised plan is yet to be approved by NHSE/I, but the CCG now says it cannot find savings worth £39.5m, leading to the rise in the deficit forecast.</p>
      <p>Asked what transformation programmes the CCG had hoped would yield savings, a spokesman said this included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revising down the level of forecast demand growth so it was “more closely aligned” with national benchmarking;</li>
        <li>Managing demand for hospital services by accelerating planned improvements in productivity; and</li>
        <li>Updating “projected increases” in additional funding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But, according to the CCG’s board papers, it will not be possible to deliver the proposed savings due to pressures within “continuing healthcare, prescribing and independent sector contracts”.</p>
      <h3><anchor name="Control_totals"/>Control totals</h3>
      <p>The CCG’s finance report also warns Devon’s providers are increasingly at risk of missing their control totals.</p>
      <p>Torbay and South Devon FT has moved its forecast deficit from £3.8m to £18.8m after missing out on expected income in relation to social care services provided to Torbay Council, failing to deliver savings schemes such as reducing outpatient follow-up appointments, and spending more money than planned on agency staff.</p>
      <p>The trust also reported sickness levels in “key specialties” — such as emergency, respiratory and stroke — adversely affecting the organisation.</p>
      <p>This autumn, the trust hired KPMG to review its finances, but the “draft” report has not yet been published.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the trust’s finance committee has heard concerns from members about a “top-down approach” being adopted by STP chiefs in charge of preparing a long-term financial plan for the health economy.</p>
      <p>According to the committee’s <a href="https://www.torbayandsouthdevon.nhs.uk/uploads/191106-trust-board-papers.pdf">minutes</a>, the approach “does not take account…of the unique position of Torbay and South Devon as an integrated trust which carries the risk of adult social care”.</p>
      <p>The minutes went on to state that members felt it is “imperative” the trust “challenges the modelling approach” used by the STP to avoid financial targets which “lack credibility”.</p>
      <p>The trust did not answer when <i>HSJ</i> asked it to clarify what the problem was with the STP’s modelling approach.</p>
      <p>Asked for a response to the allegation of a top-down approach, Devon STP’s finance lead John Dowell said: “All partners across the Devon system… are fully focused on solving the performance and financial challenges we face.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Devon, University Hospitals Plymouth Trust did not comment when asked if it was on track to achieve its finance plan to break even. However, its latest <a href="https://www.plymouthhospitals.nhs.uk/trust-board-meetings-and-papers">board papers</a> stated it faced a “forecast shortfall” against its £25m savings programme which — alongside other finance pressures — means the trust is facing a “significant challenge to deliver its financial plan”.</p>
      <p>Both Northern Devon Healthcare Trust and Royal Devon and Exeter FT are on track to hit their targets (breakeven and £8.6m surplus respectively).</p>
      <p>Devon Partnership Trust, which provides mental health services, is also reporting being on track to deliver its planned £1.6m surplus, according to its latest <a href="https://www.dpt.nhs.uk/resources/corporate-information/board-papers/2019-board-papers">board papers</a>.</p>
