      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/paul-mccartney/">Paul McCartney</a> has dropped the biggest hint yet he’s going to be headlining <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/glastonbury/">Glastonbury</a> 2020, with a rather cryptic message this morning.</p>
      <p>After months of chatters about him taking to the Pyramid Stage for the 50th anniversary celebrations at Worthy Farm next year, the Beatles star appeared to put rumours to rest on Monday.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, the musician shared a triptych of three images – composer Philip Glass, actor Emma Stone and musician Chuck Berry.</p>
      <p>Put them all together and what do you get?</p>
      <p>That’s right: Glass-Stone-Berry.</p>
      <p>Or, rather, if you still need a helping hand: Glastonbury.</p>

      <p>It should hardly be a surprise with his involvement on everyone’s lips – especially after it was<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/fleetwood-mac-led-zeppelin-not-headlining-glastonbury-festival-2020-confirms-emily-eavis-10919796/"> confirmed neither Fleetwood Mac nor Led Zeppelin would be making an appearance</a>.</p>
      <p>In April, festival founder Michael Eavis didn’t try very hard in keeping shtum on whether or not Paul would be performing for the couple hundred thousand sweaty, probably very wet and muddy, punters.</p>

      <p>On the subject he told the BBC: ‘Hopefully for the 50th. Don’t make a big thing of it though, will you?’</p>
      <p>Too late.</p>
      <p>Even back in September<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/05/sir-paul-mccartney-teases-headlining-glastonbury-2020-better-serious-10692722/"> the star cheekily hinted he would be taking to the stage</a> of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/06/glastonbury-festival-2020-tickets-sell-out-in-a-staggering-34-minutes-after-record-breaking-2-4-million-people-sign-up-10870424/">already-sold out festival.</a></p>

      <p>Speaking to the BBC, Paul said: ‘People are saying that it would be good if I did it, so I’m starting to think about whether I can or whether it would be a good thing.</p>
      <p>‘My kids are saying “Dad we’ve got to talk about Glastonbury,” and I think I know what they mean.’</p>
      <p>‘It’s starting to become some remote kind of possibility. It’s definitely not fixed yet but people are starting to talk about it,’ he added.</p>
      <p>The Yellow Submarine singer headlined the Somerset festival’s Pyramid Stage back in 2004, and performed a mix of his recent solo hits and chart-topping Beatles songs like Hey Jude and Helter Skelter.</p>
      <p>Seems the prophecy is on point so far, after festival boss Emily Eavis <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/emily-eavis-gives-first-hint-glastonbury-2020-headliners-says-first-timers-11020142/">said ‘two first-timers’ will headline the stage</a> in 2020.</p>
      <p>One down, two to go, right? Maybe.</p>
