      <h1>Prince Andrew loses spin doctor over ‘car crash’ interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:03:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/kate-halfpenny/" target="_blank">Kate Halfpenny</a></address>
      <p>The fallout from the <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/people-entertainment/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-epstein-bbc-interview/">bombshell Prince Andrew BBC interview</a> continues, with reports his PR adviser quit his role at Buckingham Palace two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Jason Stein, 28, was hired as Andrew’s spin doctor in September to repair the senior royal’s public reputation after he was linked to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.</p>
      <p>He resigned after just four weeks because he believed the <i>Newsnight</i> sit-down could backfire and urged the duke not to do it, according to <i><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/prince-andrews-pr-man-quit-after-advising-against-interview-gvc59hmql">The Sunday Times</a>.</i></p>
      <p>A palace source said the <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-testify-epstein/">49-minute interview</a>, screened on Sunday morning (Australian time) would “go down as one of the single worst PR moves in recent history”.</p>
      <p>Mr Stein urged the Duke of York not to agree to the BBC’s request for the interview.</p>
      <p>His preferred strategy was that Andrew draw attention to his charitable works and do two print interviews to commemorate his 60th birthday in March.</p>
      <p>Aides to the Queen and the Prince of Wales reacted with “incredulity and alarm” to the duke’s decision, according to a source.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles, who is touring New Zealand with the Duchess of Cornwall, viewed it as “highly misguided.”</p>
      <p>But Amanda Thirsk, the duke’s private secretary, urged him to do the <i>Newsnight</i> interview, according to the <i>Times</i>.</p>
      <p>Andrew has been accused by Australian woman Virginia Roberts Giuffre of <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/10/prince-andrew-epstein-jail/">having sex with her three times</a> when she was a teenager.</p>
      <p>He thinks his sole mistake is that he stayed at the late pedophile’s New York mansion in 2010 after Epstein was jailed for child sex offences, according to palace insiders.</p>
      <p>“He is frustrated and exasperated by the whole thing,” a royal source told the <i>Times</i>.</p>
      <p>“He thinks the whole thing is unfair.”</p>

      <p>The duke should have been more contrite, the source said.</p>
      <p>“Saying you ‘let the side down’ isn’t good enough. People expect you to actually repent.”</p>
      <p>Two days after it screened, the duke’s interview is still creating headlines with more of his answers being raked over by the UK press and on social media.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of his session with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4057825/who-emily-maitlis-bbc-newsnight-presenter/">Emily Maitlis</a> in a darkened room at the palace, Andrew said he regretted that Epstein had “quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming.”</p>
      <p>Maitlis questioned whether “unbecoming” was the right description: “He was a sex offender.”</p>

      <p>The duke tried to distance himself from Epstein by saying “it would be a<br/>considerable stretch to say he was a very, very close friend” yet he felt ending their friendship in 2010 required a face-to-face meeting.</p>
      <p>Andrew stayed with Epstein in New York for the break-up discussion because it was “convenient” and would have lacked courage if he had ended their relationship by phone, he said.</p>
      <p>“I took the judgement call that because this was serious and I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it. I had to go and see him and talk to him.”</p>

      <p>He admitted the disgraced billionaire was invited to <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/09/27/princess-beatrice-engagement/">Princess Beatrice’s</a> 18th birthday party months after being charged with sexual assault of a minor.</p>
      <p>“He came to that party knowing police were investigating him?” Maitlis asked.</p>
      <p>“I’m not quite sure, was it police? I don’t know, you see; this is the problem, I really don’t know,” Andrew said.</p>
      <p>He insisted the Queen played no role in his decision to cut things off with Epstein, saying he consulted staff, friends and family before deciding to “go and see him and I had to tell him ‘that’s it’.”</p>
