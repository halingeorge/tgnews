      <p>Ed Woodward says <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>’s ‘ultimate goal’ is to win trophies, outlining his long-term vision for the club following the release of their latest financial results.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Monday, United confirmed that the club’s first quarter revenue stands at £135.4m – up £0.4m year-on-year – while commercial revenue has increased by 5.9%.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, wages are down 8.8% to £70.2m a year, partly due to some high-earning departures – such as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/romelu-lukaku/">Romelu Lukaku</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alexis-sanchez/">Alexis Sanchez</a> – but ‘primarily due to reductions in player salaries as a result of non-participation in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a>.’</p>

      <p>Debt has gone up from £137.3m to £384.5m, a 55.5% increase, which is due to ‘an overall decrease in cash and cash equivalents’ – effectively money used for summer signings.</p>
      <p>The absence of Champions League football has seen broadcasting revenue drop by 23.1% and, coupled with the lesser prize money, annual revenue for 2020 is expected to be around £67m down on last year.</p>

      <p>Executive vice-chairman Woodward is due to hold an investors’ call later in the day, but released a statement commenting on United’s performances on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>‘We have a clear vision in terms of football philosophy and recruitment,’ said Woodward.</p>
      <p>‘The significant investments that we have made in recent years in areas such as transfers, recruitment infrastructure, analytics and our academy are already beginning to bear fruit.</p>
      <p>‘We are very proud to be shortly approaching a milestone 4,000th game featuring an Academy player, and we are particularly optimistic regarding the considerable young talent currently coming through.</p>

      <p>‘Our ultimate goal is to win trophies by playing exciting football with a team that fuses graduates from our Academy with world-class acquisitions.’</p>
      <p>United are currently in seventh place in the Premier League table, nine points adrift of the top-four places, though their form – particularly on the road – has improved significantly in recent weeks.</p>
