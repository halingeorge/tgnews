      <p>Newcastle United midfielder Sean Longstaff is not a 'key target' for Manchester United, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">the Reds'</a> radar last summer as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looked at signing a replacement for Ander Herrera, who joined PSG on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>Manchester United tend to identify three targets per position after whittling down a long list of hundreds and hundreds of players assembled on the club's database.</p>

      <p>Longstaff fits the Reds' current transfer policy as a young British player who is humble off the field but ESPN claim that Solskjaer has identified Erling Haaland, Jadon Sancho, James Maddison, Callum Wilson, Declan Rice, John McGinn, Jack Grealish and Moussa Dembele as priority targets.</p>
      <p>Despite much talk last summer, a bid for Longstaff never arrived from Manchester and Newcastle vowed the midfielder was not for sale.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> did not believe there was 'any real legs in the Man United story' and has since urged Longstaff to focus on his own performances after the youngster admitted the speculation affected him last summer.</p>
      <p>The Newcastle head coach is keen to give <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sean-longstaff">Longstaff</a> improved terms and also tie down younger brother Matty, whose current deal runs out next summer.</p>
      <p>Longstaff is currently serving a three-match ban after being sent off in Newcastle's 1-1 draw against Wolves last month.</p>
