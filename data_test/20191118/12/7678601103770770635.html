      <h1>'Ford v. Ferrari' roars to front of North American box office</h1>

      <p>New Fox release "Ford v. Ferrari" roared to the front in North American box offices over the weekend, taking in an estimated $31 million on an overall slow weekend, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Sunday.</p>
      <p>The film is based on the true story of how a team at Ford under legendary designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and working with British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) builds a car to challenge Ferrari's longtime dominance of France's classic 24-hour Le Mans race.</p>
      <p>The film garnered a rare A+ CinemaScore from viewers, the highest among new nationwide offerings, which should help it recoup its $100 million production cost, Variety reported.</p>
      <p>In second was last week's leader, Lionsgate's "Midway," with $8.8 million in Friday-to-Sunday ticket sales, just half its opening-weekend take. The PG-rated film looks at the pivotal naval battle between US and Japanese forces in the Pacific in June 1942. </p>
      <p>A new chapter in the "Charlie's Angels" saga opened in third place, taking in what analysts called a disappointing $8.6 million. </p>
      <p>The Angels' last big-screen film, in 2003, debuted to a far more impressive $37 million. Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska star as the trio of glamorous spies with a mission to save the world.</p>
      <p>Paramount's comedy "Playing With Fire" placed fourth at $8.55 million. John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and John Leguizamo portray a crew of tough firefighters who rescue three unruly siblings and end up having to babysit them.</p>
      <p>Fifth place went to Universal's early-arriving "Last Christmas," at $6.7 million. Emilia Clarke plays Kate, who is none too happy about her job as a department store elf until she meets handsome Tom (Henry Golding), who seems -- perhaps is? -- too good to be true.</p>

      <p>Overall, it was a strikingly anemic showing for the weekend's top five, which took in a total $63.6 million, less than half the $143.4 earned by the top five in the year-earlier period, Exhibitor Relations said.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the top 10 were:</p>
      <p>"Doctor Sleep" ($6.2 million)</p>
      <p>"The Good Liar" ($5.7 million)</p>
      <p>"Joker" ($5.6 million)</p>
      <p>"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil" ($5.2 million)</p>
      <p>"Harriet" ($4.8 million)</p>
