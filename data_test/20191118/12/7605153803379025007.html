        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 18 – Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha Monday announced the government had set aside Sh8bn to modernize school infrastructure in 30 counties.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Magoha made the announcement during the release of the 2019 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE).</p>
      <p>He assured all the 1,088,986 candidates who sat for the examinations last month of slots in secondary schools.</p>
      <p>“I wish to assure the Nation that everything is being done to ensure that infrastructure is expanded in order to cater for 100 percent transition. I will spend my time to ensure that the public gets value for that money,” Magoha said.</p>
      <p>The CS pointed out that 9000 scholarships are also available and will be distributed   between disadvantaged students across the 30 counties and in different slums across the country as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta.</p>
      <p>He added that the candidates will be able to know the schools they would have been placed for enrollment by December 2.</p>
      <p>“We will emjbark on placement process by tomorrow and I want to assure the parents and students at large that they will be able to know the the schools that they will join by December 2 so that they can be able to plan themselves accordingly before Christmas holidays,” the CS said.</p>
      <p>Magoha further announced that the roll-out of the new curriculum was well on course, stating that a total of 14 million books are being printed and all grad 4 ones will be dispatched in all schools countrywide by December 17</p>
      <p>Andy Munyiri from Damacrest Academy in Uthiru, Kiambu County, emerged the top student with a score of 440 marks.</p>
      <p>Three candidates – a boy and two girls – tied at 439 marks.</p>
      <p>CS Magoha said 9,770 scored over 400 marks.</p>
      <p>The CS announced that he was impressed that the cases of teenage pregnancies dropped significantly compared to last year and many girls sat for their examination without interference.</p>
      <p>He called on the parents and teachers to continue offering guidance to young girls to ensure they finish their studies and focus on their future without involving themselves in situations that could rob them of their education right.</p>
      <p>The CS applauded girls who he said are competing favorably with their boy counterparts.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile President Uhuru Kenyatta has led education stakeholders in commending the credibility of the 2019 KCPE exams.</p>
