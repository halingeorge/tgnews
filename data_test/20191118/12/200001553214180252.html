      <h1>Liverpool player back in training on international duty – Fitness boost for country and club</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:09:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Georginio Wijnaldum is out of bed and back with his Netherlands teammates.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool midfielder missed Saturday’s match after suffering from the flu. It was thought that he may be available in time for selection for the Euro 2020 qualifier, but he hadn’t returned to full training in time.</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman was also without Memphis Depay, with the Lyon player suffering from a thigh injury.</p>
      <p>Both are today back in full training, reports <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/sport/1718923703/oranje-traint-met-depay-en-wijnaldum?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=seeding-televoetbal">De Telegraaf</a>, meaning they should be available for selection against Estonia on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>For Jurgen Klopp, it will be a relief that Wijnaldum is getting some full training under his belt ahead of further key fixtures for Liverpool. The Reds face Crystal Palace away on Saturday, and Klopp won’t want a slump after the international break.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk is out of Oranje training due to personal circumstances. There’s no further information being given by the Dutch federation around the reasons for the defender’s exit from Koeman’s squad.</p>
