      <p>Taylor Swift and Camila Cabello share a close friendship. So does that mean it is awkward for the former Fifth Harmony member to hear Taylor’s romantic remix of Lover with Camila’s boyfriend, Shawn Mendes?</p>
      <p>21-year-old Shawn Mendes wrote and sang in a remix of Taylor’s Swift’s song Lover and if we didn’t know, they could have been mistaken as real-life lovers!</p>
      <p>29-year-old Taylor and Shawn are strictly friends and 22-year-old Camila is glad to see her good friend and boyfriend put their talents together to release the track on November 13.</p>
      <p>An insider told <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/15/camila-cabello-reacts-shawn-mendes-taylor-swift-lover-remix-collab/">HollywoodLife </a>Camila is happy for Shawn about his Lover remix with Taylor Swift. The Fifth Harmony member is confident, and she’s a supportive partner in whatever he does, adds the insider.</p>

      <p>Camila have been waiting for this collaboration since Shawn opened for Taylor on her 1989 World Tour in 2015.</p>
      <p>It was also reported that Taylor and Shawn have been friends for some time and they’ve toured together. Camila thinks it makes sense the two will collaborate.</p>
      <p>Camila feels that it is a great opportunity for Shawn and she wants to see what’s next in store for his fans.</p>
      <p>Another insider told <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/15/camila-cabello-reacts-shawn-mendes-taylor-swift-lover-remix-collab/">HollywoodLife</a> the fact that Shawn and Taylor are working together is amazing and Taylor admires Shawn as an artist.</p>
      <p>Camila also have toured with Taylor and it is natural because they are all friends and are supportive of each other.</p>
      <p>The good news is that this is not the last time Taylor and Shawn work together. The Lover remix was well-received, and it was a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>A third source shared that Camila is very close to Taylor. Taylor threw Camila a birthday party when she turned 18 in 2015 and she is like a big sister to her.</p>
      <p>Camila also acted as the unofficial promoter for Shawn and Taylor’s remix.</p>
      <p>The news of the collaboration was hard to keep as a secret but as soon as Taylor announced it, Camila told everyone to download the song.</p>
      <p>Fans are also supportive about Taylor’s and Shawn’s collaboration and did not think there would be any jealousy.</p>
