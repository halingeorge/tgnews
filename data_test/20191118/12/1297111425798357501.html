      <h1>Mike Downie visiting U of R to talk Secret Path, importance of reconciliation</h1>
      <h2>"We'd never heard a story about a child at a residential school, much less what it was like there for all of these kids."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:00:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/jackerman55" target="_blank">Jennifer Ackerman</a></address>
      <p>Seven years ago Mike and Gord Downie’s knowledge of Canada’s residential school system was close to nothing.</p>
      <p>Between Mike, an award winning documentary filmmaker, and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/review-from-the-past-the-hip-continues-to-earn-its-reputation-gord-downie-steals-the-show-with-his-antics">the late Gord, a wildly successful traveling musician — and frontman for Tragically Hip</a> — they had both spent years travelling the country, meeting people and hearing stories, but not about residential schools.</p>
      <p>“We’d never heard a story about a child at a residential school, much less what it was like there for all of these kids,” said Mike. “I thought I knew this country, this history pretty well and of course we didn’t.”</p>
      <p>So when Mike heard the story of Chanie Wenjack, an Ojibway boy who died in a failed attempt to escape a residential school trying to return to his home and family, he brought the story to his brother, Gord, and together they decided to share it with the world.</p>
      <p>“It just bowled me over,” said Mike, in a phone interview Wednesday. “The image of a 12-year-old boy walking along the tracks to get home and that home being so far away in late October in northern Ontario, that really affected me and it affected Gord, too, very much.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/gord-downies-secret-path-makes-reconciliation-real-for-pilot-butte-students">It led to Secret Path, a multi-media retelling of Wenjack’s story through a partnership with the Wenjack family</a>, and the Gord Downie &amp; Chanie Wenjack Fund, which aims to improve the lives of Indigenous people by building awareness, education, and connections between all Canadians.</p>

      <p>Mike will be sharing stories about how Secret Path — a collection of poems, songs, a graphic novel and an animated documentary — came to be. He will also touch on reconciliation and the need for Canadians to stand up for each other at the University of Regina on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The talk is part of the You Belong Here Speakers Series and the U of R’s anti-discrimination campaign.</p>
      <p>“I think those that have a voice and have some power need to lend that out when it’s appropriate to those that maybe don’t have as much of a voice,” said Mike. “I think that’s really important today.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/national/tragically-hip-frontman-gord-downie-dead-at-53">One of those voices, Gord, was lost to brain cancer in 2017</a>, but Mike hopes to keep the conversations around reconciliation going, something he’s been doing since Secret Path launched in Oct. 2016 when he started visiting schools for screenings of the documentary and sharing his and Gord’s journey.</p>
      <p>“When we talk about big numbers, they just kind of bounce off the brain: 150 years of this program, 150,000 children, those are kind of hard to internalize, but when you hear the story of one … it goes from the brain to the heart,” said Mike. “That’s the power of art. To open the mind and the heart at the same time and that’s what Gord and everyone else who was involved provided.”</p>
      <p>There’s no magic fix, said Mike, when it comes to making reparations for the intergenerational damage caused by the residential school system. It’s going to take millions of Canadians all acting in their own small ways to show they care and that they want the country to be more equitable.</p>
      <p>“I’m no expert on reconciliation,” he said. “I’ve had some experience with it. It’s been life-changing and I would hope that other Canadians can have their own mind-expanding experience with it and we’ll be a better country the more of us that do come to this conclusion.”</p>
      <p>Mike is scheduled to speak Tuesday from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in the U of R’s education auditorium. It is free and open to all. Snacks and refreshments will be served and the first 100 attendees will receive a You Belong Here hat. Free parking will be available in lots seven and eight.</p>
