      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Federal Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmed warned former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to not do politics over his health otherwise he may have to suffer consequences, Dunya News reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>The federal minister addressed a ceremony at a government college in Rawalpindi and maintained that the federal government should also not appeal against the Lahore High Court (LHC) decision allowing the erstwhile premier to travel abroad without any conditionality.</p>
      <p>“I do not believe in doing politics over a sick man. Nawaz Sharif should be allowed to go abroad. The government should not go to the Supreme Court against the LHC verdict,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sheikh Rashid further added that Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal (JUI-F) President Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman’s misconception has ended and has come to know of the fact that no one is supporting him.</p>
      <p>Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) is standing with Prime Minister Imran Khan, the federal minister affirmed. He expressed unawareness about any change in the federal cabinet.</p>
      <p>Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said he admits about the inflation and unemployment in the country, and assured that PM Imran Khan is working to overcome these challenges. He claimed that all detainees are considering plea bargain except PPP’s Khurshid Shah. </p>
