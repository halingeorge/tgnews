      <p>People do all kinds of things just to get a little cash, and while most of them come up with smart and peculiar ways just to get some money, what this man did really takes the cake.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7690723/African-man-digs-parents-bodies-exchange-bones-motorbike.html">Daily Mail</a>, the man is reported to have dug their graves and retrieved their bones in one night after a businessman promised to give him a motorcycle and more than $300 (RM1,246) in cash. The businessman is said to be involved in the exploration of mineral resources.</p>

        <b>“The boss told me to look for bones from people who died without getting sick. In exchange, you will get a motorbike.</b>

        <b>“I went to a family cemetery, dug up the bones from my father’s, my mother’s and my uncle’s graves.”</b>
