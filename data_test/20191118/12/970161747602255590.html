      <p>At Christmas times, there’s plenty of chocolate to choose from.</p>
      <p>Sure some love a Quality Street, others like tucking into a box of Heroes, but the ultimate indulgence has got to be a box of Lindt Lindor.</p>
      <p>The truffle chocolate encased in the rich Swiss chocolate is quite a treat.</p>
      <p>And now it comes in lots of flavours including milk, dark. mint, orange and strawberry and cream.</p>
      <p>So for those of you who can’t choose a favourite, Sainsbury’s is introducing Lindt Lindor pick and mix stands in 72 stores.</p>
      <p>Five stores have been trialling the stands this year and they’ve been so successful, they are rolling it out in 67 more on 2 December.</p>
      <p>They haven’t revealed which ones will have the stands yet so keep an eye out for them popping up in your local.</p>

      <p>It is pricer than a standard box as a 200g usually contains about 16 balls and cost around £4.</p>
      <p>Of course, this option means you can choose the perfect mix of your own flavours.</p>
      <p>Sounds like a great gift for Christmas – or just a treat to get you through the shopping for the big day.</p>
      <p>If there isn’t a stand near you, you can create a pick and mix box on the Lindt shop online.</p>
      <p>Prices range from £12 for a 400g bag to £45 for a 1500g box.</p>
      <p>They do have 27 options to choose from including winter milk and white truffles but remember you’ll also have to pay shipping, which is £3.95.</p>
