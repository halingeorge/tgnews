      <p>Different crash testing groups have different goals. Some, like the ones backed by governments, want to set safety standards and make sure automakers adhere to them, whilst others want to warn consumers of safety risks that might not be covered in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù tests.</p>
      <p>The German based crashing company DEKRA (German Motor Vehicle Inspection Association) had teamed up with the University Medical Center of G√∂ttingen for testing how safe small electric vehicles actually are, in a high-speed side pole crash impact test compared to normal combustion models.</p>
      <p>It‚Äôs this kind of combination that brings us to this video here. One that shows a <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/nissan-leaf-2010.html#aeng_nissan-leaf-2010-em61-109hp">Nissan Leaf</a> which scored a whopping 89% adult safety and 83% child safety, netting a 5 star Euro NCAP in 2012, getting bent around a pole during a side impact test. The test was done at a significantly higher speed than usual, 47 mph (75 kph), but still, the images are daunting.</p>
      <p>According to DEKRA accident researcher Markus Egelhaaf: <i>‚Äúthe damage patterns from the crash tests are comparable to those of conventionally powered vehicles, the high-voltage system in the electric vehicles was reliably shut down during the crash. And despite the fact that the drive battery was severely deformed, no fire broke out.‚Äù</i></p>
      <p>Whilst that sounds encouraging, it‚Äôs really difficult to imagine how the driver would have made it out alive from that collision. And that kind of raises some questions taking into account that the Nissan Leaf was the world's second best-selling electric car car in 2015 after the Tesla Model S, selling over 17,000 units in U.S. alone.</p>
      <p>The research bodies were able to prove that their hard work has definitely paid off and that electric vehicles are indeed on equal terms with conventional <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/i.html#ge-internal-combustion-engine"><u>ICE</u></a>-powered ones when it comes to driver and passenger safety. And while the images picture a pretty dramatic scenario, and it is indeed quite shocking, it‚Äôs still an important test to show for raising awareness on the possible consequences of an accident. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>12 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>In three of the four crash scenarios, the experts initiated a side-on collision with the post ‚Äì the Renault Zoe at 60 km/h and the Nissan Leaf (production series 2010‚Äì2017) at 60 and also 75 km/h. In an additional, fourth scenario, a Nissan Leaf underwent a head-on collision at 84 km/h.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúThe damage patterns from the crash tests are comparable to those of conventionally powered vehicles,‚Äù says DEKRA accident researcher Markus Egelhaaf. ‚ÄúThe high-voltage system in the electric vehicles was reliably shut down during the crash. And despite the fact that the drive battery was severely deformed, no fire broke out.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Fundamentally, the expert said, the chances of surviving especially a side-on impact with a tree would be very slim at those kinds of speeds. ‚ÄúBut that applies to all cars, regardless of their drive system. The major manufacturers of series-production electric vehicles have reached at least the same level of safety as combustion-engined cars.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Not for nothing did the two models tested achieve the maximum of five stars in the Euro NCAP rating. ‚ÄúOur tests confirm that no one need feel any less safe in an electric car than in a conventionally powered car.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Research project aimed at optimizing rescue procedures</p>
        <p>The goal of the research project is to optimize the process of rescuing occupants from cars involved in accidents. So the crash tests were followed by a series of experiments to determine the most effective methods and tools that the rescue services can deploy to free occupants from cars.</p>
        <p>In response to regular reports of difficulties extinguishing burning drive batteries, a new extinguishing system ‚Äì the extinguishing lance ‚Äì was among the equipment tested. If sections of a drive battery do happen to catch fire, firefighters can insert this lance directly into the battery housing. ‚ÄúThis means that firefighting takes place inside the battery, preventing the fire from spreading to other battery cells,‚Äù says DEKRA accident researcher Markus Egelhaaf. ‚ÄúThis method appears to offer potential, but further research is needed to establish just how effective it really is.‚Äù</p>
        <p>The initial conclusion is that people trapped inside an electric vehicle can be rescued using the equipment available to the fire department every bit as quickly as they can from conventionally powered cars, nor are first aiders exposed to any increased risk.</p>
