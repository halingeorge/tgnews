      <h1>West Brom ‘already aware of future proposals’ for player – Considering January or summer sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:35:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Matheus Pereira’s successful loan period at West Bromwich Albion is getting continued coverage in the Portuguese media.</p>
      <p>Claims over the weekend that Manchester United could be interested in the 23 year old may well be wide of the mark, but they’ve certainly gained attention.</p>
      <p><a href="http://abola.pt/">A Bola</a> once again state that it’s now not a question of whether the Baggies use their clause, thought to be around €10m, to sign the attacker on a permanent basis, it’s just a question of when they do so.</p>
      <p>It will be a bittersweet situation for Sporting, who never really gave the player a chance to succeed with them. They’ll be happy of the €10m, needing all the cash they can get to service debt payments, yet disappointed if they then see West Brom make a quick profit.</p>
      <p>A Bola states the Championship club are ‘already aware of future proposals’ for Matheus, which could see them pay the €10m and then bring in a much bigger fee.</p>

      <p>That scenario is now being presented as likely, with A Bola suggesting it’s just a question of whether they let him go in January or wait until next summer.</p>
      <p>Given West Brom are well placed for promotion to the Premier League, a winter sale would surely be unlikely, regardless of what is being claimed.</p>
