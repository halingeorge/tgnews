      <p>While there are definitely some excellent titles in the new batch of launch-day titles, it seems less about wowing with new content and more about bulking out the store for launch. Though the dream of being able to carry on a game of Football Manager wherever there’s a screen would have killed our exam revision schedules if it were a thing back in the day.</p>
      <p>Aside from Football Manager, which clearly isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, our pick of the new games available are Metro Exodus and Trials Rising.</p>
      <p>The former is the third in the long running series of thoughtful post-apocalyptic shooters based on the novels of Dmitry Glukhovsky. Exodus removes the series from its linear, claustrophobic roots and puts everything in an expansive open world. </p>
      <p>The latter is a maddeningly hard game where you have to balance your bike exactly right to complete a series of racing challenges. It’s ridiculously addictive. As Jake wrote in our review: “It’s a simple concept, executed with flair, and if that’s not worth applauding then what is?”</p>
      <p>Whether Stadia is the best platform to play these games on is another matter, with Jade experiencing <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-stadia-release-date-news-specs-price-3680415">mixed performance in her hands-on time</a>. We’ll find out tomorrow when Stadia officially launches.</p>
