      <p>About 70% of <b>Venice</b> is underwater once again. The water level has reached 150 cm above sea level, Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said, DPA and BTA reported.</p>
      <p>The city's lowest point, San Marco Square, was flooded and closed to tourists. The UNESCO-protected city lagoon was flooded for the third time in less than a week.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, <b>Venice</b> suffered the worst floods in more than 50 years, when the water reached 187 cm. A new <b>flood</b> hit parts of the city Friday, visited by tourists from all over the world for its canals, historic architecture and art.</p>
      <p>According to Brugnaro, who has appointed a special commissioner to handle the emergency, <b>flood</b> damage is estimated at about 1 billion euros, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>In most of <b>Italy</b> there are storms, high winds and heavy snowfall. Authorities in Florence and Pisa are closely watching the Arno River, whose waters rose quickly last night. <b>Italy</b>'s longest river, the Po, is also being monitored after rising 1.5 meters in the last 24 hours.</p>
