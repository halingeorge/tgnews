      <p>Multiple candidates taking out processions to file their nominations for the byelections to the K.R. Puram constituency resulted in traffic snarls for several hours on the busy Old Madras Road on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>A large procession taken out by B.A. Basavaraju, BJPâ€™s candidate for the bypoll led to the road being blocked for several hours.</p>
      <p>This essentially blocked off an entry point into the city causing a pile-up of vehicles on the road for several kilometres. This resulted in vehicles entering many other roads, and causing a snowball effect on several other important arterial roads as well.</p>
      <p>A senior traffic police official said that after the processions were over the traffic congestion eased, and normality was expected to be restored in about an hour.</p>
