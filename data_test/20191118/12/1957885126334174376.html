      <h1>One day before release, Google Stadia nearly doubles lacklustre launch line-up</h1>
      <h2>From 12 games to 22.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:16:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Phillips</a></address>
      <p>Google Stadia has almost doubled the number of games which will be available to buy and stream on the service when it launches tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Previously, 12 games would be available to purchase, alongside Destiny 2, which comes free. Now, that number is 22.</p>
      <p>There are no new exclusives. Tequila Works' Gylt remains the only game you can't buy anywhere else.</p>
      <p>And, as before, many of the games in the line-up have been available for a while elsewhere. If you were interested in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, for example, you probably played it a year ago.</p>
      <p>But still, 22 games is better than 12. Here's what early adopters will find on the Google Stadia store when they plug their new streaming boxes in, as announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1196244423006277632">Twitter</a> last night by games industry person Geoff Keighley:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2</li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection</li>
        <li>Farming Simulator 2019</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 15</li>
        <li>Football Manager 2020</li>
        <li>Grid 2019</li>
        <li>Gylt</li>
        <li>Just Dance 2020</li>
        <li>Kine</li>
        <li>Metro Exodus</li>
        <li>Mortal Kombat 11</li>
        <li>NBA 2K20</li>
        <li>Rage 2</li>
        <li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Samurai Shodown</li>
        <li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Thumper</li>
        <li>Tomb Raider (2013)</li>
        <li>Trials Rising</li>
        <li>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It's clear there's been a rethink behind the scenes ahead of the streaming console's launch. Google only unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-11-google-unveils-stadias-full-12-game-launch-day-line-up">Stadia's original 12-game launch line-up a week ago</a>, and had previously intended to drip-feed the other games now listed above in the weeks following launch day.</p>
      <p>But, since then, we've had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-reading-google-stadias-ama-is-like-watching-a-train-crash-everyone-is-weirdly-happy-to-be-involved-in">pretty disastrous Google Stadia Reddit AMA</a> - described by Imogen as "like watching a train crash everyone is weirdly happy to be involved in" and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-days-away-from-google-stadia-launch-microsoft-beefs-up-xcloud-offering">series of big announcements from Microsoft about its own streaming plans during X019</a>.</p>
      <p>Plenty of questions still surround Google Stadia's pricing and performance in the wild - questions which we here at Eurogamer and Digital Foundry hope to shed some light on very soon.</p>
