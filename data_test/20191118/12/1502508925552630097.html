      <h1>Under financial stress, Voda-idea to 'suitably raise tariff' from Dec 1</h1>
      <h2>The company, however, did not disclose the range or details of the proposed tariff hike</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:55:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Debt-ridden telecom operator <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vodafone-idea">Vodafone Idea </a>on Monday said it will raise mobile services rates from December 1 in the wake of ongoing financial stress.</p>
      <p>"To ensure that its customers continue to enjoy world class digital experiences, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vodafone-idea">Vodafone Idea </a>will suitably increase the prices of its tariffs effective December 1, 2019," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vodafone-idea">Vodafone Idea </a>said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The company, however, did not disclose the range or details of the proposed tariff hike.</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea last week reported consolidated loss of Rs 50,921 crore - highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate - for the second quarter ended September 30, on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court order in the adjusted gross revenue case.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court last month ruled in favour of the government and directed telecom companies, including Vodafone Idea, to pay dues as demanded by the Department of Telecom.</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea said that now its ability to continue business will depend on reliefs sought from the government and positive outcome of the legal option it has.</p>
      <p>"The acute financial stress in the telecom sector has been acknowledged by all stakeholders and a high level Committee of Secretaries (CoS) headed by the Cabinet Secretary is looking into providing appropriate relief," the statement said.</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea has around 300 million mobile subscribers.</p>
