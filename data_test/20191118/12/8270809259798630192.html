      <p>In mid-November, many began to wonder how to get and turn a dark mode on TikTok. Russian and Western users share screenshots that depict the TikTok application with a dark theme. This feature has appeared recently, and it is available only to owners of iPhones.</p>

      <p>At the moment, there is one way to enable dark theme on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a>. To do this, you need to have a modern iPhone or iPad and upgrade to iOS 13. The following models support this operating system: iPhone XS Max, iPhone XS, iPhone XR, iPhone X, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone SE, iPad Air 3, iPad Pro 2018, iPad Pro 2017, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 5, iPad mini 4.</p>

      <p>The turning of a dark theme on the iPhone or on the iPad occurs in the settings. You need to go to the image management section and find the toggle switch responsible for activating the mode.</p>
