      <p>Former India batsman <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/slideshow/best-innings-of-vvs-laxman">VVS Laxman</a> was part of India’s Test 'Fab Five' in the 2000s, which also featured Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, and Virender Sehwag. Each of them have played some fabulous match-winning knocks for India at the peak of their powers. However, when it came to picking the greatest match-winner for India he has played with, Laxman chose another former skipper - Anil Kumble.</p>
      <p>In an episode of the Very Very Special stories, Laxman termed the legendary leggie as the ‘the biggest match-winner’ he played with.</p>
      <blockquote>“My dear friend <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/5-memorable-anil-kumble-moments-cricket-field">Anil Kumble</a> is probably India’s biggest match-winner. The biggest match-winner I played with,” Laxman said.</blockquote>
      <p>In the episode, he also remembered the first match he played against Kumble during his younger days.</p>
      <blockquote>“It was a bad memory. I did well for Hyderabad and India U-19 so I was picked for the India B side in the Challengers Trophy. The match was happening in the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium. I can never forget the sound of the ball hitting my pad. Against a leggie you go on the backfoot try to hit it square of the wicket. I did that in the previous ball but the next ball struck my pads even before my bat came down, Anil was quick in the air,” recalled Laxman.</blockquote>

      <p>Adding to it, Kumble replied,</p>
      <blockquote>“I had heard about you. I knew you were a backfoot player. Probably that’s how I used to set up a player. I just got lucky that day and I also remember coming to you after that match telling you not to play on the backfoot.”</blockquote>
      <p>Both Laxman and Kumble were match-winners for India in their own right. Laxman played 134 Tests for India and is most remembered for the match-turning 281 against the near-invincible Aussies at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/first-ever-day-night-test-in-india-5-things-we-know-so-far">Eden Gardens</a> in 2001. On the other hand, Kumble finished as India’s leading Test wicket-taker, with 619 wickets in 132 Tests. He remains only the second player in history to have claimed all ten wickets in an innings in a Test match.</p>
