      <p><b>DANVILLE, Ky.Â (AP)</b> - A Kentucky pet store owner says two women stole a pair of guinea pigs, lobbing one of the animals at him during their escape.</p>
      <p>News outlets report 21-year-old Isabelle Mason and 19-year-old and Jaimee Pack on Saturday tried to smuggle out the animals from Pet Paradise without paying. Owner Scott Gonyaw told WKYT-TV he confronted the suspects, screaming "Give me the guinea pigs!" as they got into a car.</p>
      <p>One suspect rolled down a window and tossed a four-month-old guinea pig named Lucky onto the concrete. The other ran over Gonyaw's foot with the car. He says he suffered bruising.</p>
      <p>Lucky wasn't injured. The other guinea pig remains missing.</p>
      <p>Jail records show Danville police charged the women with shoplifting, robbery and animal cruelty. It's unclear whether they have lawyers.</p>
