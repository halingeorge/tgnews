      <p>A teenager was seriously injured when she ‘threw her whole self’ over her 11-month-old nephew after they were attacked by machete-wielding thugs.</p>
      <p>The 13-year-old girl is in a critical condition after being stabbed at a house in Lisnaskea, Co Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, at around 9pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A video posted online is believed to have shown the girl’s injuries, which are said to have included a deep wound down her back.</p>
      <p>Family member Elizabeth Joyce, was also treated for stab wounds to her leg but has since been discharged from hospital, said the girl was a hero and she was the reason the boy was unharmed.</p>
      <p>Ms Joyce <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-50452248">told the BBC</a>: ‘The baby was unharmed because his auntie is a hero.</p>

      <p>Ms Joyce said she hit one of the attackers with a photo frame to defend herself.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I had to get off the chair because I knew I’d be sliced.</p>
      <p>‘I picked up my frame with my kids’ photo on it. I hit one of them at the door to get him away from her.’</p>
      <p>The teenage girl sustained serious stab wounds and was taken to hospital where she remains in a critical but stable condition.</p>
      <p>Police have launched an attempted murder investigation.</p>
      <p>The girl’s family are from the Travelling community and police believe the attack could be in relation to a dispute.</p>
