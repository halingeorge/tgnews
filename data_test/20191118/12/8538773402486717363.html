      <h1>NBA Power Rankings Week 5: Houston surges into top 3; Golden State hits rock bottom</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:49:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN.com</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a> are the hottest team in the NBA, and they have one player to thank -- <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990984/buddy-hield">Buddy Hield</a>.</p>
      <p>Wait, what?</p>
      <p>That's right, thanks in large part to <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/game?gameId=401160826">35 points from Hield on Sunday</a>, the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings">Sacramento Kings</a> snapped the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a>' NBA-leading, 10-game win streak, leaving the Rockets' seven-game run as the longest active win streak in the league. That, and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden">James Harden</a> breaking all kinds of offensive records, of course.</p>
      <p>How high can Houston climb? Where does Boston land after the loss? And what will <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george">Paul George</a>'s scorching start mean for the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a>? We answer all that and more in this week's edition.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Throughout the regular season, our panel (ESPN's Tim MacMahon, Andre' Snellings, Royce Young and Bobby Marks, and The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears) is ranking all 30 teams from top to bottom, taking stock of which teams are playing the best basketball now and which teams are looking most like title contenders.</i>

      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james">LeBron James</a> set his season high with a <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/recap?gameId=401160830">plus-30 plus/minus</a> after recording 33 points, 12 assists and 7 rebounds in a win over Atlanta on Sunday. It was his 11th double-double of the season (third best in the NBA). James already has four 30-point games this season. <i>-- Spears</i></p>

      <p>The loss of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward">Gordon Hayward</a> to a broken hand did little to cool off the hottest team in the NBA. Despite a one-point loss at Sacramento, Boston still had wins this week over Dallas, Washington and Golden State. The Celtics have an Eastern Conference-best 10-2 record and rank third overall in point differential. In the three wins this week, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3917376/jaylen-brown">Jaylen Brown</a> had his best stretch of basketball, averaging 23.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game and pulling off a rare 50/50 -- 51.9% from the field and 50% from deep. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden">James Harden</a> could really have a legitimate chance to join Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to average 40 points per game for a season. Harden is averaging 39.5 points despite shooting poorly in four of the first five games of the season. Harden has averaged 43.0 points during the Rockets' seven-game winning streak, and he isn't just lighting it up on offense. Houston is allowing only 95.9 points per 100 possessions with Harden on the floor during the winning streak. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>

      <p>The Bucks have lost <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6609/khris-middleton">Khris Middleton</a> to injury for the next few weeks, but they actually stepped up their play to go undefeated for the week. They have won three straight games and seven of their past eight, and their offense has keyed the way, as they are leading the league in scoring (118.8 points per game) and are fourth in team field goal percentage (47.1%). <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> leads the efficiency brigade, taking 46.4% of his shots within 3 feet of the rim and making a whopping 83.7% of them. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

      <p>So, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george">Paul George</a> is back -- like, <i>back</i>. In two games, he has scored 70 points in 44 minutes. As George said after his <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/28098440/clippers-paul-george-says-back-scoring-37-rout-hawks">37 in 20 minutes</a> against the Hawks, he has new shoulders and hasn't been this healthy in some time. He came back with such force that it overshadowed what was otherwise a pretty bad loss to the Pelicans in his debut. But we're still waiting on George and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> to take the floor together, and you can see the potential two-way destruction coming with it. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>Utah misses backup big man <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4259/ed-davis">Ed Davis</a>, who the Jazz hope will return from a broken left fibula in two weeks. In the meantime, developmental prospect <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065673/tony-bradley">Tony Bradley</a> has been pushed into the rotation, averaging a dozen minutes per game, during which the Jazz have a minus-16.0 net rating. Utah has still won four of six games since Davis' injury, in part because of center <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert">Rudy Gobert</a>'s dominance (16.7 points on 72.5% shooting, 15.5 rebounds, 1.8 blocks per game). Gobert wants to play more minutes, but the Jazz aren't willing to take a long-term risk for a short-term solution. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>

They've won six of seven, and it's been a little something different in most of those. On Sunday, it was <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936299/jamal-murray">Jamal Murray</a> with 39 points and eight assists in one of the most complete games of his young career. Against the Nets a few nights earlier, it was stingy defense and balanced scoring with seven players in double figures. That's the unique element to the Nuggets: They don't rely on any one player to beat you, but at any moment, they have a couple of players who can do it anyway. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>The schedule set them up for a three-game winning streak, and the Heat obliged in convincing fashion. They are fourth in defensive efficiency and have the fifth-best overall net rating (6.5) in the league. And if you're looking at a week like the last one and saying it's a schedule thing, consider this: According to <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/stats/rpi/_/sort/SOS">ESPN RPI</a>, the Heat have played the second-toughest schedule so far, and <a href="http://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength">according to Tankathon</a>, they have the second-easiest remaining schedule in the league. <i>-- Young</i></p>

They have continued to play well despite the injury absence of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3012/kyle-lowry">Kyle Lowry</a> (thumb), in large part thanks to the excellent play of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet">Fred VanVleet</a>, who has averaged 22.8 points, 8.0 assists and 2.0 steals per game during the four games since Lowry went down. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

His outing in Saturday's win over the Raptors represented significant progress despite his struggles from 3-point range (1-of-7, including some wide-open misses). "He played his best offensive game in terms of movement and causing problems for the other team," coach Rick Carlisle said. Porzingis scored twice on dunks off cuts, matching his total from his previous 10 games. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>

      <p>The Timberwolves lost their last two games of the week after having won three of their previous four, and a good chunk of those blowout losses can be attributed to the absence of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059319/andrew-wiggins">Andrew Wiggins</a> (personal, bereavement).

      <p>The Nets limped to the finish line on a five-game road trip with a 2-3 record, including a win at Chicago without the backcourt that started the trip -- <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991043/caris-levert">Caris LeVert</a>.

Throw out the loss to Phoenix, and Brooklyn easily could have gone 4-1 during the trip. However, after having double-digit leads at the half against Utah and Denver, Brooklyn went on to shoot a combined 29.9% from the field, 15.9% from 3 and a paltry 43.9% on shots within 5 feet of the rim in those two games. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>The Magic have bounced back from their slow start, winning four of five after losing four straight. One big change that they've made is leaning more on <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6588/evan-fournier">Evan Fournier</a> as a lead guard. He averaged 21.0 points and 5.4 assists per game during the 4-1 stretch, after accounting for only 10.8 and 2.0, respectively, during the losing streak. Per Second Spectrum data, heading into Sunday, Fournier had produced 1.002 points per chance as the ball handler in pick situations, significantly up from point guards <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066636/markelle-fultz">Markelle Fultz</a> (0.779 points/chance) and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3415/dj-augustin">D.J.

      <p>The Blazers are basically doing the inverse of the 2018-19 Rockets: They have gotten off to a terrible start (in part due to depth and injury issues) and are now <i>bringing in</i> <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a>.

And it could be something of a soft opening for the Melo-era Blazers, too: Assuming he debuts Tuesday in New Orleans, five of his first six opponents are sub-.500 teams. <i>-- Young</i></p>

Instead of a six-game losing streak with back-to-back losses to Detroit and New York, the Hornets now find themselves in the top eight of the Eastern Conference and just one game under .500. The win at New York saw Graham not only hit a 3 to win the game but also make nine 3-pointers, tied for the most by any NBA player this season. The three games this week also saw head coach James Borrego change his starting lineup, inserting Graham alongside <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3074752/terry-rozier">Terry Rozier</a> in the backcourt. The three-game sample saw the guards average a team-high 56.3 points when on the court. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>There is no confirmation that the Knicks have petitioned the NBA to have their remaining games all played against the Mavericks. For a second consecutive week, New York had its most complete game of the season versus Dallas, this time at home against Mavs in Kristaps Porzingis' return to Madison Square Garden. Despite a one-point loss to Charlotte on Saturday, the turmoil that surrounded the organization last week can maybe, temporarily, be put to rest. While it has taken 13 games, head coach David Fizdale has finally found a lineup to his liking, inserting <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3986/taj-gibson">Taj Gibson</a> into the starting lineup. The Gibson move has allowed <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4351852/mitchell-robinson">Mitchell Robinson</a> to provide the needed energy that the bench had been lacking. In the Dallas and Charlotte games, Robinson averaged 16.5 points and 10 rebounds in 24.5 minutes of action. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>Golden State's rankings free fall is complete, but that doesn't mean there aren't a few bright spots for the defending West champs. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3133817/eric-paschall">Eric Paschall</a> scored a game-high 30 points at New Orleans on Sunday, and the 2019 second-round draft pick now has scored 30-plus points twice this season.
