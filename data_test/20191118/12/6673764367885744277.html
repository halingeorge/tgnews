      <p>Actress Erika Sawajiri, who was arrested late last week for allegedly possessing the synthetic drug MDMA, has admitted to using illegal drugs for more than 10 years, police sources said.</p>
      <p>Sawajiri, 33, told investigators that she got the MDMA at a nightclub event a few weeks ago, and that she had previously used marijuana, LSD and cocaine, as well as MDMA, the sources said Monday.</p>
      <p>“I first used illegal drugs more than 10 years ago,” one of the sources quoted her as telling police. “Every time a famous person was arrested over drugs, I told myself to be careful because I might be in danger too.”</p>
      <p>The police raided her home in Tokyo on Saturday morning when she returned after a night out at a club in the Shibuya district and found 0.09 gram of powder containing the MDMA.</p>
      <p>The police are analyzing her cellphone to determine how she got the drug and trace its route. They are also analyzing a urine sample to determine whether she used the drug, the sources said.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Sawajiri was turned over to prosecutors while the Tokyo District Court allowed her to be detained until Nov. 26.</p>
