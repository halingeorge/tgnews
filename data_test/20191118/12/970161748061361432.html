      <p>A McDonald’s worker has been dubbed the ‘Robin Hood of McNuggets’ following a recent revelation.</p>
      <p>Cody Bondarchuk worked in McDonald’s for two-and-a-half years but has only just come clean about something he used to do during his shifts.</p>
      <p>Cody, from Alberta in Canada, took to Twitter to share a secret he had kept with him for the length of his employment.</p>
      <p>He revealed that he sneaked an extra chicken nugget into every 10-piece, for the entire time he had worked there.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I worked at McDonald’s for two-and-a-half-years and I put 11 nuggets in almost every 10-piece I made.’</p>

      <p>Social media users have been quick to comment on Cody’s confession.</p>
      <p>One simply said: ‘Not all heroes wear capes, just name tags’</p>
      <p>While another replied: ‘You are an everyday hero. It’s these little things that can give people a lift!’</p>
      <p>Someone else joked: ‘Are you working at a bank now and if so which branch?’</p>
      <p>Another asked if any customers had realised what Cody had done for them.</p>
      <p>The former employee responded: ‘The location was mostly drive-thru so not that I can remember, but I’d like to imagine they went home, saw the extra nug, and smiled a little,’</p>
      <p>In a reply on Twitter, Cody said that he had calculated that he owed Ronald McDonald roughly ‘about $1,600.’</p>
      <p>What a legend.</p>
      <p>The news comes after the fast food giant announced last week that it would be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/mcdonalds-is-extending-its-breakfast-opening-hours-starting-next-week-11163322/">extending its breakfast opening hours by half an hour</a> – starting this Wednesday.</p>
