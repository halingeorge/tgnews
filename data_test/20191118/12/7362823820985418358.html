      <p>Aerial searches were set to resume Monday morning off the coast of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maine">Maine</a> after a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/transportation">sailboat</a> carrying three people was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons">reported missing</a> over the weekend following a distress call that abruptly cut off.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/coast-guard">U.S. Coast Guard</a> said Saturday morning on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/twitter">Twitter</a> that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/disaster-response">rescuers </a>were searching for Charlotte Kirby, Nathaniel Davis and Wilfredo Lombardo, who were aboard the 40-foot sailboat named Dove. The boat was last known to be about 20 miles south of Mount Desert Island, where the famed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maine">Acadia National Park</a> and seaside hamlet town of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast">Bar Harbor</a> are located.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard said that dispatchers on the mainland received a 911 call at about 3 a.m. from passengers on the boat that warned they were in distress.</p>
      <p>“They basically said ‘help’ and ‘we’re on a boat’ before the call cut out,” Coast Guard spokeswoman Petty Officer Nicole Groll told the Portland Press Herald.</p>

      <p>After the call was placed, the Coast Guard said that rescue crews from the from Station Southwest Harbor, Air Station Cape Cod, and the Canadian Coast Guard responded to the area to assist.

      <p>“We’ve basically searched the entire New England coast,” <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2019/11/17/aerial-search-for-missing-sailboat-from-maine-turns-up-nothing-new/">Groll told the Portland Press Herald</a>. “We are doing everything we can to make sure we don’t miss anything.”</p>
      <p>The sailboat's home port is John Williams Boat Company on Mount Desert Island, and the ship departed from the Somes Sound before the distress call was made.</p>
