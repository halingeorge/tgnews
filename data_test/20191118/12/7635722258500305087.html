        <b>The chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says a meeting with the Courts Service last week revealed the "biggest shambles" he has seen in the committee.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It comes amid revelations over outstanding fines and disqualified drivers.</p>
      <p>PAC chair Sean Fleming says they were told that there's no system in place to follow-up on orders that a disqualified driver give up their driver's licence.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, figures highlighted by Deputy Fleming <b><a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/views/driving-system-breaks-down-as-more-people-ignore-it-964827.html">in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i></a></b> reveal the State is losing up to €27 million in unpaid fines, including those for driving offences.</p>
      <p>It's after a law change in 2016 to stop people being jailed for the non-payment of fines - with 90,000 fines now said to be outstanding.</p>
      <p>Deputy Fleming told Pat Kenny that the courts aren't able to cope with additional demands resulting from the change.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm chairing the Public Accounts Committee for the last couple of years at this stage, and last Thursday's meeting with the Courts Service was the biggest shambles I've ever seen in the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
      <blockquote>"[It's] not specifically all the fault of the Courts Service - they say they're hamstrung by the legislation drafted by the Department of Justice.</blockquote>
      <p>"Really it does go back to the Department of Justice - but the Courts Service are the people who are in the eye of the storm, where all the problems are arising. It's happening on their watch, even though they would say it's really the Department of Justice that's causing the problem."</p>
      <p>He said the PAC heard that the court system could not cope if all the outstanding cases were brought back before a judge.</p>
      <p>Deputy Fleming said: "You have the vast, vast majority of people paying their fines... and then they realise that those who don't bother are very likely to get off scott-free.</p>
      <p>"That undermines the entire system, and that's not fair to the public."</p>
