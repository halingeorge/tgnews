      <p>Stephanie Davis told her fans about her high functioning autism which explains her alcoholism.</p>
      <p>In a telling piece to camera shared on Monday, the Hollyoaks star put on a brave face while she documented her struggles.</p>
      <p>The actress said being diagnosed with the condition helped her understand why she felt she had to drink so much booze to "calm her nerves" in social situations.</p>
      <p>"I do believe it's why I drank a lot more. I found it really exhausting," she said.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-one recalled how she would down a bottle of wine to calm the nervous jitters she felt before she hit the bars in Manchester as a youngster.</p>

      <p>As she mulled over her ongoing struggles, Stephanie voiced she believed she was "self-medicating" to reduce her "anxiety" and feelings of sickness.</p>
      <p>She said: "The thought of going to the bar was horrific. Oh my God, I'd have to drink a bottle of wine. I do believe I self-medicated.</p>
      <p>"The anxiety, I'd sweat, feeling sick, and I'd have a tantrum. I can't do it. Cry my eyes out. I would try to get myself ready, drink a bottle of wine on the way to calm my nerves."</p>

      <p>In the light of the diagnosis, Stephanie confirmed she had "struggled" her whole life especially with social exhaustion.</p>
      <p>The telly star confessed at times she felt like an "alien" because she never really felt like she fitted in anywhere.</p>
      <p>It was a big step for Stephanie to share her diagnosis with her fans and she admitted she isn't - and may never be - ready to share all her mental health issues.</p>

      <p>"So I've been diagnosed with a few mental health issues and I'm not ready to talk about them all yet or if I ever will be," she said.</p>
      <p>Stephanie asked for help among her sea of followers when she did her piece to camera.</p>
      <p>"When I've been at my lowest points, I talk to the camera," she said.</p>
      <p>"Why I don't, I do it to see my progress to ask for help and advice."</p>
      <p>It is going to be the first of many blogs from the former soap star where she will open up about her struggles.</p>
      <p>Unashamed Stephanie has decided to speak out in order to help other people as she feels it is her calling in life.</p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>, she added: "People say to me why share everything, but I feel like, what’s the point in going through everything I have if I can’t share it when I KNOW it will help others? I’ve already helped so many with my experiences in life and I feel like that’s my calling."</p>
