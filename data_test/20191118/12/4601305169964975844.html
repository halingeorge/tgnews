      <h1>Microsoft’s Cortana is sleeping with the fishes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:00:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/seamus" target="_blank">Seamus Bellamy</a></address>
      <p>Lots of people are fine with allowing a helpful wiretap into their lives. I am not one of them. None of them. So, when I heard that Cortana was being sent out to pasture by Microsoft, I was pretty excited. The dismantling of surveillance apparatus that’s slimed its way into our daily lives always leaves me feeling a little frisky.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://gizmodo.com/farewell-cortana-1839907363">Gizmodo</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>That’s according to a support article Microsoft posted to several regional markets this week, though a spokesperson later clarified to Gizmodo that only users in the following areas can expect to say goodbye to the voice assistant: Great Britain, Australia, Germany, Mexico, China, Spain, Canada, and India. Despite dropping the app in these regions, Cortana itself remains “an integral part” of the company’s business model to incorporate “conversational computing and productivity” into its products according to the spokesperson, so Microsoft doesn’t appear to be closing the coffin on it entirely.</blockquote>
      <p>According to Gizmodo, at least in North America, we’ll have to put up with the company’s post-Clippy assistant on our smartphones until January 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>Cortana’s death has been a long time coming. Last year, Microsoft’s CEO admitted that the company’s virtual assistant could keep up with the likes of Alexa or Siri.</p>
      <p>Score one for those of us who don’t want our gadgets listening in on us. I can only hope that Halo’s Master Chief will be able to quickly deal with the loss of his long-term companion and move on with his life.</p>
