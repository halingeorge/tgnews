      <p>Kelly Clarkson is sticking around in daytime TV.</p>
      <p>NBCUniversal Television Distribution has renewed <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i> for a second season in syndication. The early pickup for 2020-21 comes as the daytime talk show has performed solidly in ratings over its first two months.</p>
      <p>"<i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i> is connecting with viewers in a unique way, and we are so happy to build on that momentum, bringing Kelly’s brand of humor, heart, and, of course, the incredible 'Kellyoke,' to stations for a second season," Tracie Wilson, executive vp creative affairs at NBCUniversal Television Distribution, said Monday in a statement. "It is a privilege to be in business with Kelly and our production team, led by Alex Duda, who have a clear creative vision and a talent for storytelling and creating quality entertainment that invites you in for a good time and leaves you feeling happy."</p>
      <p>Clarkson's show has averaged 1.9 million daily viewers since its Sept. 9 premiere. That's the strongest start for a first-year syndicated talk show in seven years. <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i> ranks fourth among all syndicated talk shows behind only long-running veterans <i>Dr. Phil, Live With Kelly and Ryan</i> and <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>.</p>
      <p>The Grammy winner opens each show with a "Kellyoke" segment, covering a song the audience connects to. Her guests include a mix of celebrities and everyday people, often sharing the couch together.  </p>
      <p><i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i> is at the head of the biggest class of first-year syndicated strips in eight years. In the week ending Nov. 3 (the last frame for which ratings are available), it outdrew its closest rookie competition — the talker <i>Tamron Hall</i> and Jerry Springer's court show <i>Judge Jerry</i> — by about 600,000 viewers each. The show airs on more than 200 local stations covering virtually 100 percent of the country.</p>
      <p><i>Steve Harvey</i> and <i>Tyra Banks Show</i> veteran Duda is executive producer and showrunner of <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show.</i> Clarkson and Brandon Blackstock also executive produce.</p>
