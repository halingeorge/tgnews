        <b>Meet the ones who kept it super fashionable in the city and those who just couldn't get it right. Time for a style check</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kareena Kapoor Khan was spotted at the airport as she returned to Mumbai with li'l Taimur. Mouni Roy also here. Shivaleeka Oberoi was snapped during one of the promotions for her debut film, Yeh Saali Aashiqui. Parineeti Chopra and Pooja Hegde were papped in the city as they posed candidly for shutterbugs.Â </p>
      <p>So, let's find out who were the stunners and bummer of the day:</p>
      <p><b>SHIVALEEKA OBEROI- BUMMER</b>- Shivaleeka's floral maxi is not cutting it for me. Way too cliche!</p>

      <p><b>KAREENA KAPOOR KHAN- STUNNER</b>- Kareena Kapoor Khan is a total head-turner in her desi attire- loved the colour of her kurta.</p>
