      <p>A mum is under police investigation after uploading a video of her six-year-old son driving a car along a motorway at 80mph.</p>
      <p>Agina Altynbayeva, 29, then told those commenting that she was being reported to police: ‘F*** you all.’</p>
      <p>In the video, the mum films as her son sits behind the wheel of a Hyundai Solaris while driving in Tatarstan, western Russia, with the hazard lights on.</p>

      <p>The speed dial is shown hovering over 130 kilometres per hour, or 80mph. The speed limit is 120kph (75mph).</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether the boy, who is said to have had eye surgery this summer, is operating the foot pedals of the car.</p>

      <p>On the clip, titled ‘Happy Son’, the mother-of-four commented: ‘I live the way I want.</p>
      <p>‘I regret nothing, I am calm about everything. I do not need your crippled comments.</p>
      <p>‘You have not tried living my life. You don’t have a right to judge me.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I am proud that my children can easily drive a car.’</p>
      <p>Agina, who has worked in advertising and car rentals, then claimed she lets her kids drive to make up for their father being absent from the family home.</p>

      <p>She said she is also teaching them to shoot for the same reason.</p>
      <p>Agina said: ‘I love every minute of this life spent with my boys. I so much like being a mother.’</p>
      <p>Swearing at shocked viewers who said they would be notifying the police, she argued: ‘There is a law but it does not say that children can’t go behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>‘Let’s compete in who knows traffic rules best.</p>
      <p>‘Do not comment on my life, or teach me how to live it.</p>

      <p>‘I am not interested in your private life and I would like it to be mutual. I do everything right, and if you think that I am not right, it is your problem.’</p>

      <p>State police and childcare authorities have launched a preliminary investigation, according to the Tatar-Inform news outlet.</p>
      <p>Russia has gained an international reputation for shocking driving antics thanks to the popularity of dashcams.</p>
      <p>According to the RAC it is illegal to let a child under 12 sit in the front seat of a car in Russia unless there is a special child restraint.</p>
