      <p>In a few hours, Google will officially launch the Stadia gaming system. The new game streaming platform has been highly anticipated ever since it was introduced back in March as a new cheat-proof and cloud-based video game platform by Google. It was presented to the public at a press conference ahead of E3 2019 and the Stadia Controller soon went up for pre-order on the Google Store. We also learned the Stadia would support the Pixel 3 series and multiplayer gaming.</p>
      <p>A few Google Stadia games have been <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/google-stadia-list-of-confirmed-launch-games-available-here-20190820/">confirmed</a> and<a href="https://androidcommunity.com/google-stadia-games-available-at-launch-listed-here-20191111/"> more titles</a> have been added to the list. A lot of good news has also been added like the idea it would <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/google-stadia-may-come-to-android-tv-next-year-via-android-11-20190917/">come to Android TV</a> next year via Android 11, as well as, have <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/google-stadia-support-coming-to-pixel-2-phones-20191017/">support for the Pixel 2 phones</a> and for more <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/google-stadia-will-support-more-pixel-phones-platforms-20191030/">Pixel phones and platforms</a>.</p>
