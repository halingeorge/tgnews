      <p>Vinnie Jones will be staying on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity despite trying to quit the spin-off series in scenes that aired at the weekend.</p>
      <p>During Saturday’s show, the actor asked music mogul <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/kevin-mchale-eliminated-from-the-x-factor-celebrity-as-simon-cowell-refuses-to-let-vinnie-jones-drop-out-11168924/"> if he could forfeit his place in the competition</a> so that Glee star Kevin McHale could go through to the semi-finals, but the judge denied his plea.</p>
      <p>‘Simon, I feel like I’ve had a fantastic time, I’ve really enjoyed it,’ Vinnie said at the time. ‘It’s been everything I’ve need since my wife’s passing.’</p>

      <p>Pointing at Kevin, Vinnie added: ‘This guy is a real singer, I think he can win it. For his career, I’d like to step down so that he can go through.’</p>
      <p>‘The last person I want to fall out with is Vinnie Jones,’ Simon replied. ‘But I think we’re about to because I’m going to ask you to stay in the competition.’</p>
      <p>A show insider has since confirmed that Vinnie will return to the stage when the show returns later this week.</p>

      <p>A TV source told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘As Vinnie said at the end of the show, Simon is the boss and he was happy to accept Simon’s decision.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/kevin-mchale-eliminated-from-the-x-factor-celebrity-as-simon-cowell-refuses-to-let-vinnie-jones-drop-out-11168924/">Kevin was the latest contestant to leave X Factor: Celebrity</a>, meaning just six acts will be going head-to-head in the semi-final.</p>
      <p>Simon, who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/simon-cowell-changes-the-x-factor-celebrity-rules-live-on-air-as-love-islanders-voted-off-11072658/">announced on last weekend’s show that the final would feature a wild card act</a> from among those who have been eliminated, still has three acts left in the competition.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nicole Scherzinger has two and Louis Walsh has only Megan McKenna.</p>
      <p>The controversial ‘safe-seat’ was scrapped by Simon in the show’s most recent episode.</p>
      <p>With one per judge, an act chosen for a safe seat would go automatically into the next week’s live show, thereby skipping the all-important public vote.</p>

      <p>Addressing the change, Simon said: ‘I actually do read social media, and they said they hated [the safe seats] so they’ve gone.’</p>
