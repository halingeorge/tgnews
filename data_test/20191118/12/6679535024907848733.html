      <p>Suriya, whose last outings on the big screen was Selvaraghavan’s<i> NGK</i> and KV Anand’s <i>Kaappaan,</i> is currently busy with <i>Soorarai Pottru</i>, directed by Sudha Kongara. The latest is that the actor has rapped the ‘Maara Theme’ in the film, composed by music director GV Prakash. The composer tweeted, “Mr.Maara raps ... #maaratheme will be rapped by @Suriya_offl sir #sooraraipottru #sudha #arivu.”</p>
      <p><i>Soorarai Pottru</i> is said to be a film based on Air Deccan founder GR Gopinath. The biographical film, jointly produced by Suriya’s 2D Entertainment and Guneet Monga, boasts a stellar cast including Aparna Balamurali, Jackie Shroff, Karunas, Mohan Babu and Paresh Rawal in prominent roles.</p>
      <p>Singing is relatively new for Suriya: he has sung only a couple of times before. The actor lent his voice to a coffee advertisement jingle a few years ago and also sung the Yuvan Shankar Raja-composed <i>Ek Do Teen </i>number in <i>Anjaan.</i></p>
      <p>Actors of Tamil cinema have often sung in their projects, in order to provide a novelty factor to the album. Actors Vijay and Dhanush are regular singers these days – the former’s last song was <i>Verithanam</i> from <i>Bigil.</i></p>
