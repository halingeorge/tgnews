      <h1>Putting on a 'game face' may actually boost your performance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:38:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author">Christian Cotroneo</a></address>
      <p>A little groggy today?</p>
      <p>Put on your game face.</p>
      <p>Matthew Richesin, a postgraduate student at the University of Tennessee, probably heard that one before too. So he figured he would see if having a "game face" really upped one’s game.</p>
      <p>For the research, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.2899">published in the journal Stress and Health</a>, Richesin was inspired by shirts at his own school emblazoned with the words, “Get Your Game Face On.”</p>
      <p>While Richesin noted previous psychology studies suggesting facial expressions have an impact on mood, there was scant evidence it gave people an actual performance boost.</p>
      <p>“There’s anecdotal evidence of game face having an impact based on its common use among athletes,” Richesin <a href="https://news.utk.edu/2019/11/13/get-your-game-face-on-study-finds-it-may-help/">notes in a news release</a>. “But we wanted to see if it would help on physical and mental challenges from a scientific perspective.”</p>
      <h3>The power of the face</h3>
      <p>So Richesin and his colleagues devised two simple tests. For the first, they asked 62 people to put their hands in ice-cold water — and hold it there for a few minutes. The second experiment required participants to sleuth out a puzzle.</p>
      <p>For each experiment, the participants were divided in half — one group was told to keep their expressions intense and earnest. The other group was allowed to let their faces do whatever their faces felt like doing in the moment.</p>
      <p>The result? The "game face" crowd not only performed, on average, about 20% better, they also recovered from stress — that would be the ice water — more effectively.</p>
      <p>But what exactly is a game face? For the study, Richesin and his colleagues defined is as “a serious, focused, or determined facial expression.”</p>
      <p>It’s certainly not to be confused with the face you may currently be wearing — one of incredulity and deep suspicion.</p>
      <p>Nor is it in the same ballpark as a fake smile, which <a href="https://www.mnn.com/health/fitness-well-being/stories/why-fake-smiles-dont-always-help-you-feel-good">doesn’t do a whole lot for anyone</a>.</p>
      <p>No, if Richesin’s research holds true, you’re going to need to strap on one of these:</p>

      <p>Or maybe try one of the most famous games faces of all time — <a href="https://swimswam.com/phelpsface-trends-nationally-twitter-monster-staredown/">the one legendary swimmer Michael Phelps wore</a> before dominating the men’s 200m butterfly at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.</p>
      <p>That’s a <i>game face</i>.</p>
      <p>In any case, Richesin suggests we don’t actually have to be competing for Olympic gold to reap the benefits of a scrunched-up "I-got-this" face.</p>
      <p>“If making a game face has the potential to improve performance, we may find this concept can have application outside of the traditional venue of sports,” he notes in the release.</p>
      <p>So go ahead. Try one on. At the very least, you'll <i>look</i> like you know what you're doing.</p>
