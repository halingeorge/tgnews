      <h1>Kolide: User Focused Security For Teams That Slack [Sponsor]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:12:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macstories.net/author/macstoriestaff/" target="_blank">MacStories Team</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://kolide.com/?utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=macstories">Kolide</a> is a new Slack app that messages employees when their Mac, Windows, or Linux device is not compliant with security best-practices or policy.</p>
      <p>With this app, Kolide will notify users or groups when a device is out of compliance along with clear instructions about what is wrong, and step by step instructions to remediate the issue themselves. They can even confirm in real-time that they resolved the problem with an interactive button inside the Slack message!</p>
      <p>Unlike most endpoint security solutions, Kolide was designed with user privacy in mind. Your users will know what data is collected about their device, who can see that data, and can even view the full source code of the agent that is run on the device.</p>
      <p>Kolide is already used by hundreds of fast growing companies who want to level-up their device security without locking down their devices. Try Kolideâ€™s new product for free for 30 days for your entire fleet by visiting <a href="https://kolide.com/?utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=macstories">kolide.com</a>.</p>
