        <figcaption>Martin Lewis debunks the myth surrounding private car parking tickets</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It's a guaranteed way to ruin your day: walking back to your car only to find a parking ticket on the windscreen.</p>
      <p>But don't despair, because although the number of parking tickets issued in the UK is on the rise, depending on the circumstances there's a chance you won't have to pay.</p>
      <p>Popular financial website Money Saving Expert have put together a guide to appealing unfair charges, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/how-fight-parking-ticket-according-17273000?_ga=2.121061839.65649806.1574076791-1037732264.1574076791">Wales Online reports</a> .</p>
      <p>According to the website, 56% of people who try to appeal their ticket are successful and do get the charge overturned.</p>
      <p>Here are the steps to take:</p>
      <h3>Check what kind of ticket you've got</h3>
      <p>Parking tickets either come from official bodies like councils, or from private companies. They tend to look similar but it's important to check which you're dealing with as it can make a difference.</p>
      <p>If it's called a Penalty Charge Notice, Excess Charge Notice or Fixed Penalty Notice, and it includes the name of an official authority, such as a local council or the police, then this is an official ticket. If it is one of the last it is a criminal ticket rather than civil and the process is different.</p>
      <p>Private companies will adopt a similar design, but will called their tickets something like 'Parking Charge Notice'.</p>
      <p>Remember that if it's a council fine for a ticketed carpark, you should get 10 minutes leeway - so if you arrive up to ten minutes after the time you've paid for has expired, you shouldn't get a fine.</p>
      <p>If you're dealing with a parking charge notice from a private company remember it is not a fine, it is an invoice.</p>
      <h3>Work out if you were actually in the wrong</h3>
      <p>Money Saving Expert emphasises they're not actually there to help in cases where you've genuinely caused a traffic problem, parked in the wrong place, or overstayed the time on a ticket you were aware of.</p>
      <p>We're talking here about things reasonable people would think were unfair, like unclear signs or malfunctioning machines failing to give you a ticket.</p>
      <h3>Gather evidence</h3>
      <p>You'll need to prove your point, so snap pictures of any unclear signs, bay markings or lines. Pictures of where your car was, the meter and your ticket should all be relevant, plus anything else you think that supports your case. For example, if you'd broken down, keep paperwork relating to that.</p>
      <p>If there are any witnesses - anyone who can corroborate your story - get their contact details and ask them to sign a statement detailing what they saw.</p>
      <h3>Don't pay, but get in touch immediately</h3>
      <p>If you pay up, you've admitted liability and you won't have a leg to stand on. But you can't just ignore the ticket and need to take steps, if possible while you're still within the window for paying only half the fine.</p>
      <h3>Work out your grounds</h3>
      <p>There are official grounds under which you can appeal the charge, and if you can prove one of these, you shouldn't have to pay. You can also claim mitigating circumstances as to why you were unable to pay, but these are more subjective and you're less guaranteed success.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The signs were wrong. </li>
        <li>The traffic warden or council got it wrong - you shouldn't have had a ticket, eg if a blue badge was on show</li>
        <li>You've already paid the fine</li>
        <li>The council made an error on the ticket or letter. This applies when councils have failed to include all the required information, such as on their tickets or 'Notice to Owner' letters.</li>
        <li>The traffic rules are wrong. </li>
        <li>You didn't own the vehicle at the time. </li>
        <li>They wrongly claimed the warden was stopped from giving a ticket. If they had the opportunity to put a ticket on a vehicle, they can't then decide to send one via post.</li>
        <li>Your car was stolen.</li>
        <li>The costs were more than standard charges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mitigating circumstances could include a very recent bereavement or an emergency that you had to attend.</p>
      <h3>Launch the appeal</h3>
      <p>For official fines there should be an address or email address on the ticket or letter. There may also be a form to fill in online.</p>
      <p>Submit all the evidence you have gathered, stick to objecting on the grounds set out above and include any mitigating evidence.</p>
      <p>Make sure to appeal with 14 days, or 21 days if your fine was sent by letter.</p>
      <p>At this stage you should still only be liable to pay the half price fine if you lose.</p>
      <p>If your first informal appeal fails, or you didn't appeal in time you can go to a formal appeal process - this is when your fine could double.</p>
      <p>Instead of just sending a letter or email there will now be a form to fill in. Include all your evidence, objections and mitigation again.</p>
      <p>If this fails you will get a letter of rejection.</p>
      <p>You can now go to an independent tribunal, for which the contact details will be sent with your rejection letter.</p>
      <p>By this point, you will have lost the chance to pay half the fine - but there are no further costs associated with continuing.</p>
      <p>You won't have to attend a hearing, but you can if you like, and you can also give evidence over the phone.</p>
      <p>Again it will be a case of filling in a form, writing a letter and sending all your evidence and statements.</p>
      <p>If it's a private company you're dealing with, they should give details of their appeals process with the ticket: that's how you'll send in the evidence you've gathered.</p>
      <h3>Can I just not pay?</h3>
      <p>For official fines, not paying could eventually lead to a court appearance.</p>
      <p>With private companies, some people say they think it's worth the risk of not paying up. But you could still end up in court if the company decides to pursue you through the civil courts, with could end up being a pricey business for you.</p>
      <p>The most 'legitimate' method is to follow the official procedure - starting by following the company's appeals procedure which will be set out on their notice.</p>
      <p>Detail why you think you shouldn't pay and include any evidence.</p>
      <p>If this fails you can then appeal to the trade body the company is affiliated to - which will mean either an appeal to Popla or the Independent Appeals Service (IPA).</p>
      <p>The company should tell you which to use, and you can appeal online or by post by filling in forms and sending all your evidence.</p>
      <p>Popla cancelled 52% of the tickets it was referred and while the IPA doesn't publish figures 17% of tickets were cancelled by the company that issued them when the case was referred.</p>
      <h3>Different kinds of charges</h3>
      <p>If your ticket is an Excess Charge Notice from a council - the process is the same in terms of gathering all evidence and launching an appeal.</p>
      <p>You will probably have to go straight to a formal appeal procedure, and if that fails you may be appeal to appeal to a more senior officer within the same local authority. If that fails, you can appeal to the ombudsman - your council will be able to give you the correct contact details.</p>
      <p>If you get a Fixed Penalty Notice from the police, it is likely you will need to go to court to challenge it.</p>
      <p>Some forces allow an informal appeal, so check your letter or ticket for details.</p>
      <p>When you get your FPN, you have 28 days to pay, nominate another driver or request a hearing at magistrates court.</p>
      <p>If you want to go to court it is worth getting legal advice as if you lose you could end up having to pay court costs., Contact the Citizen's Advice Bureau if you are unsure.</p>
