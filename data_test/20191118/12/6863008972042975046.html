      <p>Ukraine's Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says that the deployment of a peacekeeping mission to Russia-occupied Donbas could be an alternative to the Minsk peace agreements.</p>
      <p>The Foreign Ministry has got "a folder with Plan B in case Plan A does not work," he told the Ukrainian news agency <a href="https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/pristayko-operatsiya-podderzhaniyu-mira-alternativoy-1574058665.html">RBC-Ukraine in an interview</a>.</p>
      <p>"I have said many times this could be a peacekeeping operation. It is not foreseen by the Minsk process at all. And even when it is discussed by the leaders, a fair question arises: Are we <a href="https://www.unian.info/politics/10754610-ukraine-may-withdraw-from-minsk-agreements-fm-prystaiko.html">going to withdraw from the Minsk deal</a>? That is, I did not say anything 'anti- Minsk.' On the contrary, the leaders have long been discussing the possibility of changes that provide for the possibility of a peacekeeping mission," Prystaiko said.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the minister noted that if this option does not work, for example, if Russia blocks a UN Security Council decision and no peacekeepers are deployed, the diplomatic system will probably offer Plan C.</p>
      <p>"And we have a few more options in stock that have already been outlined to the president in general terms," Prystaiko added.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, Foreign Minister Prystaiko said that Ukraine could withdraw from the Minsk agreements in case of the failure of a Normandy summit, which is expected to take place before the end of the year.</p>
