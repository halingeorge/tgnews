      <p>One lucky Ladbrokes punter made more than £17,000 off a £5 bet at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The customer managed to correctly predict the outcome of every Euro 2020 qualifier on Friday and Saturday.</p>
      <p>The £5 18-fold was turned into £12,868.25, but he activated Labrokes Odds Boost feature which thumped his winnings up to an incredible £17,181.19.</p>
      <p>Steven Davis will certainly receive plenty of thanks from the punter who backed Northern Ireland to get a draw against the Netherlands at Windsor Park.</p>
