      <h1>Google's Black Friday Sale Offers Huge Savings on Phones and More</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:20:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Google is slashing prices on its brand new Pixel 4 and Nest Mini, as well as a bunch of other gadgets.</p>
      <p>Black Friday is approaching and Google is joining the party late by waiting an entire week before the fact to roll out its sale, as opposed to launching it at the tail end of October like everyone else seemed to be doing. Over at the <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/">Google Store</a>, you'll find savings of up to £300 on a range of devices from Pixel phones, to Nest gadgets, and tablets.</p>
      <p>The sale goes live on Friday, November 22, and might be the perfect time for you to grab a discount on a new gadget . Some of the deals on offer include a <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/pixel-4-review-it-wins-by-being-more-human/">Pixel 4</a> or Pixel 4XL for £70 off, down from £669 to £599, as well as £20 off the new <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/the-nest-mini-is-an-excellent-if-unnecessary-upgrade/">Google Nest Mini</a>, making it a very reasonable £29, so if you were looking at upgrading or getting on the Nest action, now might be the perfect time.</p>
      <p>Google's Black Friday sale was <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/google-pixel-4-black-friday-sale/">leaked early via an American ad</a> which boasted a $200 discount on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL at the Google Store - that's around £156, but as expected, the actual discount in the UK store wasn't anywhere near as generous, but it's better than a poke in the eye, as they say.</p>
      <p>You'll also find deals on the Pixel 3a, Home Hub, Chromecast Video, Nest Cameras, and the Pixel Slate, which will see a £300 discount and have a Slate keyboard chucked in for free.</p>
      <p>You can peruse all of the various Black Friday deals going on and coming up <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/search?searchTerm=black+friday">right here</a>.</p>
