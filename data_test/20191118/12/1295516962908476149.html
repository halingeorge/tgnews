      <h1>James Gunn Isn't Ruling Out a DC/Marvel Crossover Movie</h1>

      <p>Though they're considered rivals in the comic book industry, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/dc-comics/">DC</a> and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-comics/">Marvel Comics</a> have produced a number of crossovers between their properties in the past, with the most recent being 2003's <i>JLA/Avengers </i>limited series.</p>
      <p>That said, some fans would surely like to see a crossover between the two companies on the big screen, and while it may seem unlikely, <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> and <i>The Suicide Squad</i> writer/director James Gunn isn't ready to rule anything out.</p>

      <p>While superhero crossover films are now more common thanks to 2012's <i>The Avengers</i>, a crossover between the two most prominent comic book companies in a cinematic form would be an impressive feat to pull off. However, Marvel and DC being owned by Disney and Warner Bros. respectively could prove problematic in making this a reality.</p>
      <p>Written and directed by James Gunn, <i>The Suicide Squad</i> is set to hit theaters Aug. 6, 2021. Several cast members from 2016's Suicide Squad will reprise their roles, including Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg and Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang. Also joining the cast are David Dastmalchian, John Cena, Joaquin Cosio, Nathan Fillion, Mayling Ng, Flula Borg, Sean Gunn, Juan Diego Botto, Storm Reid, Pete Davidson, Taika Waititi, Alice Braga, Steve Agee, Tinashe Kajese, Daniela Melchior, Peter Capaldi, Julio Ruiz, Jennifer Holland, Idris Elba and Michael Rooker.</p>
