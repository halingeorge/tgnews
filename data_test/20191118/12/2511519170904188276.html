      <h1>England’s Euro 2020 squad ranked and rated: Who will make the cut and who risks being left at home?</h1>
      <h2>Gareth Southgate has a number of difficult decisions to make ahead of the tournament next summer</h2>

      <p>England will be among the top seeds at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> after securing qualification for next summer’s tournament last week – and competition for places in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GarethSouthgate">Gareth Southgate</a>’s 23-man squad is fiercer than ever before.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s 7-0 drubbing of Montenegro sealed top spot in Group A and automatic qualification for next summer’s finals, when the Three Lions’ pool matches will be played at Wembley.</p>
      <p>England were not as convincing three days later at improving Kosovo yet emerged 4-0 victors in Pristina, thanks to efforts from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/harry-winks">Harry Winks</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Harry_Kane">Harry Kane</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marcus-rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mason-mount">Mason Mount</a>.</p>
      <p>That win in the Balkans means they are guaranteed to be among the top six seeds in the Euro 2020 draw later this month, which in theory should provide a kinder draw.</p>
      <p>But, after the match, captain Kane warned his international team-mates that nobody’s place is safe, such is the competition to hold down a place in the squad.</p>
      <p>“When you look through our squad everyone pretty much is playing regularly either in the Premier League or top leagues in Europe,” Kane said. “If you’re not on it every week there are players who can take your spot.”</p>
      <p>Southgate has selected a number of different players since the 2018 World Cup – and started with seven different midfield combinations in his last eight games – and has a number of big decisions to make ahead of the tournament next summer.</p>
      <p>Here, we rank the players who have a chance of making the 23-man squad next summer, from least to most likely.</p>
