          <b>PITTSBURGH STEELERS' MASON RUDOLPH DECLINES TO FILE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CLEVELAND BROWNS' MYLES GARRETT</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Rudolph’s representatives suggested Friday that the quarterback could pursue legal action against Garrett. However, the NFL Network reported that Rudolph wouldn’t file charges in the case and considered the situation to be an NFL issue.</p>
      <p>“I thought it was cowardly and bush league,” Rudolph said after the game Thursday. “There is plenty of tape out there to watch. I haven’t seen it yet. I don’t know what the rules are. I know it was bush league and a total coward move on his part. It’s OK, I’ll take it. I’m not going to back down from any bully out there. We will see what happens.”</p>
      <p>The NFL suspended Garrett indefinitely for the attack. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey received a three-game suspension and Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi was suspended one game.</p>
