        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 18 – Andy Munyiri from Damacrest Academy is the top performer in this year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) after scoring 440 marks out of the possible 500 marks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha said Munyiri was followed by Flavian Onyango, June Koech and Michael Ndung’u who tied with 439 marks as he announced the KCPE results Monday afternoon,</p>
      <p>“The top candidate in this country’s Kenya Certificate of Secondary School is Andy Michael Munyiri of Damacrest School Thogoto with 400 marks. Three candidates tied in the second position two of them girls from public schools; these were Flavian Onyanyo of Chakol girls, June Cheptoo Koech of Sanalo Central and Sean Michael Ndung’u of Kitengala international school,” Magoha announced.</p>
      <p>He stated that the number of students who scored 400 marks and above reduced from 11, 559 in 2018 to 9770 in 2019.</p>
      <p>Magoha however said the number of students who scored between 300-400 increased from 223, 862 in 2018 to 243,320 in 2019.</p>
      <p>“In the 2019 examination the students improved their overall performance and I am glad because this is an indication that teachers are doing a good job. However, the number of students who scored between 400 marks and above reduced compared to last year,” Magoha said.</p>
      <p>Some 1,088,746 candidates sat for the national examination between October 28 and 31.</p>
      <p>Magoha assured all candidates will be admitted in secondary schools.</p>
      <p>The CS announced that he was impressed that the cases of teenage pregnancies dropped significantly compared to last year.</p>
      <p>Magoha called on the parents and teachers to continue offering guidance to young girls to ensure they complete their studies and focus on their future without involving themselves in situations that could rob them of their right to education.</p>
      <p>The CS applauded girls who he said are competing favorably with their amle counterparts.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile President Uhuru Kenyatta commended the credibility of the 2019 KCPE exams.</p>
      <p>Speaking at State House Nairobi, the President praised the Ministry of Education and KNEC for conducting the national exams in a transparent and secure environment.</p>
      <p>Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang commended the enormous commitment exhibited by teachers during the examination process emphasizing that Kenyan teachers have proved to be dedicated in their work.</p>
      <p>Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia announced plans to reward teachers who played pivotal roles in ensuring the exams were conducted seamlessly.</p>
      <p>Kenya National Examination Council Chairperson John Onsati has also assured that the council will continue to deliver credible examinations.</p>
      <p>The three had accompanied Magoha at the KNEC headquarters along Denis Pritt Road in Nairobi during the formal release of the 2019 KCPE results.</p>
      <p>Candidates are required to send their index numbers to 20076 to receive their results.</p>
