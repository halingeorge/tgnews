      <h1>Squirrels 'stealing teddies' from graves at Burton cemetery</h1>
      <h2>They're also accused of ripping the heads off graveside flowers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:54:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Rhea Turner</a></address>
      <p>Squirrels have been blamed for stealing teddies and ripping up graveside flowers at a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">Burton cemetery</a>.</p>
      <p>Last week, dad John Dutton told of his devastation after thieves targeted son Martin's grave at Stapenhill Cemetery.</p>
      <p>The 73-year-old, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">from Stapenhill</a>, vowed to "fight tooth and nail" for security measures and petition for CCTV to be installed.</p>
      <p>It sparked a debate on social media, with mourners split on whether CCTV was the answer.</p>
      <p>And one woman said it was not always humans to blame when things went missing from graves.</p>
      <p>Christine Found said: "I feel (CCTV) won’t work as it is a large area and it is very dark up there at nights.</p>
      <p>"I also have my 17-year-old old son up there that I have spent a lot of hours up there trying to cope with the loss.</p>

      <p>"I have been visiting for more than five years and now a daughter I lost this year.</p>
      <p>"So I am going through a bad time and when I feel I need to go up, I just go day or night until they close the barriers.</p>
      <p>"We also have had things taken but one thing I can say is wildlife has a lot to answer for as well.</p>
      <p>"I have witnessed squirrels taking teddies, ripping heads off flowers, digging up plants, the crows take the lids off the flower and candle pots to get to either the water or the wax.</p>
      <p>"I have been up there in bad winds when pots and other things have blown off and scattered all over the place.</p>
      <p>"I also was up there when a family was trying to blame staff for damage to the grave but as I had seen myself; her pots had blown off in bad weather and caused the chip.</p>
      <p>"So really there isn’t as much stealing and vandalism going on up there as you think. Yes some things have been stolen but it is also nature and wildlife."</p>
      <p>While some readers sympathised with him and supported his plans, others said they felt it would invade mourner’s privacy.</p>
      <p>Vonny Upton, who experienced the same with her son's grave, said: "I have the deepest sympathy for the family and others that have had their loved ones resting place vandalised or items stolen.</p>
      <p>"I know how this feels because it happened to my son’s grave. The culprit was caught and charged.</p>
      <p>"But I don’t think it is right to have CCTV cameras put up the cemetery. It is a place to go and visit our loved ones in private."</p>
      <p>Steve Culpan added: "My heart goes out to this guy and his family, and others that have the resting places of their loved ones violated.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately we have lowlife scumbags that have no respect for the dead (or the living) who seem to feel it is their right to take what they want, even though to them most items would have no value or purpose.</p>
      <p>"I am not sure cameras are the solution here though as you would probably find that many prefer their privacy.</p>
      <p>"Most of these lowlifes would know where the cameras are and how to avoid identification anyhow.</p>
      <p>"What is needed is a stronger deterrent so that those that commit these crimes, and that's what they are, know that they face long hard labour if they are caught."</p>

      <p>Julie Glover called the thefts "disgusting and disrespectful" while Steve Martin expressed his sympathies to Mr Dutton and said he hopes something is put in place.</p>
      <p>Becky Ducker also said she "fully backs" Mr Dutton after meeting him at the churchyard.</p>
      <p>Tracey Taylor wrote: "This is so heartbreaking and makes you feel so angry that this happens all the time up there.</p>
      <p>"I have lots of family up there and friends. With the maintenance fees they charge you would think they would have put CCTV up all over the cemetery years ago."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for East Staffordshire Borough Council, said: "We would urge anyone with information to report it to the cemetery office or Staffordshire Police.</p>
      <p>"The barriers are closed every night at 4pm and the public are asked to leave by 4.30pm when they are locked.</p>
      <p>"CCTV has been previously considered, but having discussed the matter with families, it is felt to be inappropriate to record the cemetery at what is a very sensitive time.</p>
      <p>"It is also problematic to cover all areas of the cemetery."</p>
