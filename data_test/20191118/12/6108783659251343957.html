      <h3>Too little, too late?</h3>
      <p>EA is looking to “drastically” change looter shooter <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/anthem/">Anthem</a> </i>in an effort to save it after months of mediocrity, a report from <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem/">Kotaku</a> suggests.</p>
      <p>Kotaku’s Jason Schreier cites sources who allege BioWare Austin will lead rejuvenation efforts. The efforts, nicknamed “Anthem 2.0” or “Anthem Next”, will “drastically” change mechanics including looting, mission design and even the game’s overworld.</p>
      <p>“We’re… looking at breaking up the need to go back to [Fort Tarsis] after every mission,” one source said, “and what a mission technically is. That was always a weird disconnect. [We’re] trying to integrate the disparate parts of the game together.”</p>
      <p>EA has yet to comment on the report.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/anthem/">Anthem</a> </i>is currently available on Windows PC, Xbox One and PS4.</p>
