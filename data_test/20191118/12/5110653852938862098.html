      <h1>DeAndre Hopkins calls out NFL after badly missed pass interference call in Texans vs. Ravens</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:10:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>At this point we should not be surprised when the NFL refuses to overturn a challenged pass interference call or non-call even when the foul or non-foul seems obvious. The league <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/pass-interference-non-call-cardinals-bucs-pi-review/1264ork3u5jj11plbx833fbaf8">has made clear</a> it will only overturn what it considers egregious acts.</p>
      <p>Yet here we are, surprised that the NFL didn't overturn a non-call on an obvious pass interference in the first quarter of Sunday's Texans-Ravens game in Baltimore. While this one occurred early in what ended up being <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/game-center/baltimore-ravens-vs-houston-texans/dt87n1i6eesr42lihh2kq49d6">a blowout</a>, itwas <i>really</i> bad.</p>
      <p>With just under six minutes to play in the opening quarter, Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson, on a fourth-and-2 at Baltimore's 33-yard line, threw a pass to DeAndre Hopkins in the end zone. Hopkins, though, was quite literally tackled by Ravens corner Marlon Humphrey before the ball arrived and was never given a chance to catch the pass. No flags were thrown.</p>

      <p>Texans coach Bill O'Brien challenged the play, and upon review by NFL vice president of officiating Al Riveron in New York, the play stood as (non) called.</p>
      <p>Houston would have gotten the ball on Baltimore's 1-yard line. Instead, the Texans turned the ball over to the Ravens.</p>
      <p>Seriously, NFL: What are we doing here? Hopkins is wondering the same thing.</p>

      <p>Hopkins' tweet after the game was a clear shot at Riveron. O'Brien is looking for answers, too.</p>
      <p>"I have no idea what pass interference is anymore," the Houston coach said after the game, via <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/17/bill-obrien-i-have-no-idea-what-pass-interference-is-anymore/">Pro Football Talk</a>."No idea."</p>
      <p>Added <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronWilson_NFL/status/1196190148226093059">Watson</a>: "I mean, everyone saw it. The guy wrapped him around, but they didn't make that call. You got to live with it. You can't really dwell on it. It definitely could have been a changing point of the game, a momentum switch."</p>
      <p>The NFL's officiating Twitter account, which the league often uses to explain calls and non-calls, had not addressed the Texans-Ravens play as ofSunday evening.</p>
      <p>This is yet another example of the NFL's <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-pass-interference-rule-2019-explained-new-challenge-replay/153i5zqtso35g1h46l4h6jlw9g">new pass interference replay initiative</a>, supposedly installed to prevent the kind of error seen Sunday in Baltimore, being at best disingenuous and at worst a complete joke.</p>
