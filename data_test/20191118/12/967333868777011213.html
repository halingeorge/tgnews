      <p>Several law enforcement officers were killed during the protests in Iran, the country's government spokesman Ali Rabiyee said.</p>
      <blockquote>"Unfortunately, riots have taken place in the past few days. Several law enforcement officers were attacked and died as martyrs," Rabiyee said during a press conference.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the Iranian state media, at least two people were killed during the protests over the weekend. The number of arrests made during the protests has reportedly risen to 1,000. According to Fars news agency, the greatest damage was caused by the unrest in the provinces of Tehran, Fars, Khuzestan and Kerman.</p>
      <p>Protests took place in several cities across Iran last week after the government announced plans to increase petrol prices by at least 50 per cent. Commenting on the decision, officials said that higher petrol prices would free up money to help low-income families. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei welcomed the government's plan on petrol prices and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911171077330436-iranian-supreme-leader-warns-of-foreign-backed-thugs-inciting-unrest-amid-fuel-price-spike/">blamed</a> the unrest on 'Iran's enemies'. </p>

Signed in 2015 by Iran, China, Russia, France, Germany, the UK, the EU and the US, it required Tehran to wrap up its nuclear program and downgrade its uranium reserves in exchange for lifted sanctions. </p>
