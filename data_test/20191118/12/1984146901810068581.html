      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend</a> teenager was left speechless after finding out that she will represent the North East in a worldwide dance competition.</p>
      <p>Urban cheer dancer Katelyn Patterson will <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/traffic-travel">travel</a> to Japan on Tuesday to compete in the International Federation of Cheerleading World Championships.</p>
      <p>This year will see the annual competition host the first urban cheer category in its 10 year history.</p>
      <p>After beating hundreds of hopefuls, Katelyn, 16, said: “I can’t wait to compete in this competition. I’m so excited, I just wish it was happening now.”</p>

      <p>Katelyn will be one of the youngest to compete in her category.</p>
      <p>However, the graphic design student at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-college">Newcastle College</a> explains that despite being fairly new to urban cheer, she feels confident and enjoys working under pressure.</p>
      <p>The opportunity has required great dedication from Katelyn, who has had to balance her education with travelling to Manchester every month for training.</p>
      <p>Katelyn’s mum, Julie Patterson, 48, said: “I’m bursting with pride. It’s hard to believe she is going to compete in such a big competition. I’m so unbelievably proud of her.”</p>
      <p>Katelyn has been dancing at Smiths Academy Performing Arts School of Dance, at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/byker">Byker</a> Community Centre, for three years.</p>
      <p>She joined the school when it had recently opened and explains that she couldn’t have asked to attend a better dance school.</p>
      <p>Dance teacher Dominique Bias said: “This is the biggest thing Smiths Academy has been a part of and the most amazing opportunity for our students.</p>
      <p>“I am extremely proud of Katelyn, Team UK couldn’t have picked a more kind and caring <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/education">student</a>. She is a born leader and a fantastic role model.</p>
      <p>“I am honoured to have Katelyn in my dance school and she deserves all the recognition she can get as she has worked extremely hard.”</p>
