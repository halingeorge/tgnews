      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest transfer news | The Reds have been linked with a host of players ahead of the January transfer window - here is a round-up of who has been tipped to move to the City Ground</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:16:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>The January transfer window opens in less than two months, and it could prove to be a busy period for a number of clubs in the Sky Bet Championship.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> signed 12 players during the summer, but could they look to dip back into the market in the New Year to strengthen their squad?</p>
      <p>Sabri Lamouchi’s side are in fifth place in the Championship table as we go into the final international break of the calendar, and promotion to the Premier League appears to be a real possibility a third of the way through the season.</p>
      <p>Here, we take a look at the players who have been linked with a move to the City Ground during the January transfer window in recent weeks.</p>
      <h3>Jack Clarke</h3>

      <p>Forest have been linked with a January move for Leeds United winger <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-linked-january-move-3530171">Jack Clarke</a> .</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old is currently on loan at Elland Road from Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur but has seen little game time.</p>
      <p>And according to <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/football">Sporting Life</a> , he is “likely” to be recalled by his parent club in January as, it is claimed, a couple of other Championship clubs “have expressed an interest in taking him for the second half of the season”.</p>
      <p>It is said <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">the Reds</a> could be one of those teams interested as they may look to add another winger when the window opens.</p>

      <p>Forest could reignite their interest in Newcastle United striker <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/dwight-gayle-nottingham-forest-newcastle-3449184">Dwight Gayle</a> when the transfer window opens.  </p>
      <p>Lamouchi’s <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Reds</a> were keen to try and tempt the prolific Championship striker to the City Ground <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-webchat-live-sarah-3191514">in the summer</a> along with a clutch of other clubs, but were unable to complete the deal.</p>
      <p>Now, according to the Athletic, Forest may well be tempted to move for the 29-year-old, who netted with such regularity at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/dwight-gayle-hurt-after-being-2551895">West Brom last season</a> .</p>
      <h3>Billy Gilmour</h3>

      <p>Forest are said to have been eyeing up promising Chelsea youngster <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-eye-premier-league-3437349">Billy Gilmour</a> .</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old midfielder came up through the academy at Scottish giants Rangers before making the move to Stamford Bridge two years ago.</p>
      <p>According to London Football News, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">the Reds</a> and Championship rivals Leeds “have been tracking the best players in Chelsea’s development side, for which Gilmour has caught the eye since being signed from Glasgow Rangers”.</p>
      <h3>Lawrence Shankland</h3>

      <p>The Reds were extensively linked with the striker in the summer, before he joined Dundee United.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4935824/lawrence-shankland-nottingham-forest-dundee-united-transfer-news/">The Sun</a> reported that Sabri Lamouchi is looking to add another striker in January to provide competition for top scorer Lewis Grabban.</p>

      <p>The 22-year-old is on loan at French second division club Ajaccio from Olympiacos, the Greek giants, like <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> , owned by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/evangelos-marinakis">Evangelos Marinakis</a> .</p>
      <p>According to Greek media outlet <a href="https://www.sdna.gr/podosfairo/648718_olympiakos-maties-tis-notigham-forest-se-kaipers?amp">SDNA</a> , the Reds have been impressed by the Under-19 international’s blistering start to the French league season, and are considering a move in January.</p>
      <h3>Randell Williams</h3>

      <p>Cardiff City, QPR and Huddersfield Town have all been linked with the midfielder, who has been instrumental in Exeter's charge to the very top of the fourth tier, according to TeamTalk.</p>
      <p>The former Tottenham Hotspur youth star, 22, has turned out 19 times this season for the Grecians in League Two, scoring once and impressing during his time in Devon.</p>
