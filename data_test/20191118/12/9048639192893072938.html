      <p><b>(WAFB) - </b>The Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) says it has confirmed the first death linked to a vaping-associated lung injury, or EVALI, in the state. LDH was unable to provide specifics about the deceased individual due to privacy concerns.</p>
      <p>LDH says the outbreak in Louisiana now includes 30 total cases. Among the Louisianans with these lung illnesses/injuries, the primary exposure factor is a combination of nicotine and THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the main active ingredient in marijuana.</p>
      <p>According to LDH statistics, the median age of people diagnosed with a vaping-related lung illness is 29. The youngest person is 17 and the oldest is 71.</p>
      <p>The combination of nicotine and THC accounts for more than half of all illnesses (55%) in Louisiana, though one in five individuals (21%) with EVALI report use of nicotine alone, LDH reports.</p>
      <p>Users of vaping products are urged to immediately seek medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, fever and/or nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and vomiting.</p>
      <p>LDH provided the following recommendations to users of vaping products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discontinue using vaping products.</li>
        <li>Do not purchase vaping products off the street and do not modify them or use substances not intended for use by the manufacturer.</li>
        <li>Youth, young adults and pregnant women, as well as adults who do not currently use tobacco products, should not use vaping products.</li>
        <li>Adults who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using vaping products.</li>
        <li>Adults who are vaping should not smoke combustible cigarettes as a replacement for nicotine. (E-cigarettes and other vaping devices are not FDA approved as smoking cessation tools.)</li>
        <li>Monitor for symptoms of severe side effects if you do use vaping products. If you do develop symptoms, seek medical attention.</li>
      </ul>
