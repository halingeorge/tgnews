      <p>A 15-year-old girl and a truck driver were killed Monday after a suspension bridge over a river in southwest France collapsed, reigniting a debate over infrastructure safety in the wake of last year's deadly disaster in Genoa.</p>
      <p>Two vehicles plunged into the fast-flowing Tarn river after the bridge between the towns of Mirepoix-sur-Tarn and Bessieres, 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Toulouse, gave way.</p>
      <p>The bridge collapsed after the suspension cables snapped, crashing into the waters of the Tarn, with only a small portion left exposed above the river.</p>
      <p>The girl was travelling in the car with her mother, who was plucked from the water by bystanders, Toulouse public prosecutor Dominique Alzeari said.</p>
      <p>The truck driver's body was found after a day-long search by more than 60 rescue workers, including divers, according to rescue workers and the mayor of Mirepoix-sur-Tarn, Eric Oget.</p>
      <p>"The body, which is in the truck, has not yet been freed," Oget told AFP.</p>
      <p>Five people, including two rescue workers and some local people who tried to save the victims, were seriously injured, according to the region's security department.</p>
      <p>The bonnet of the sunken car could be seen sticking out of the water as helicopters circled overhead.</p>
      <p>Authorities had earlier said that a van might also have fallen into the river and that "several" people might be missing, but Alzeari said "that does not appear to be the case."</p>
      <p>An investigation into the cause of the collapse was under way.</p>
      <p>The environment ministry said that recent inspections of the bridge had "shown no security defects".</p>
      <p>The council of the local Haute-Garonne area said the bridge, which dated to 1931 and had been renovated in 2003, underwent a "thorough" inspection in 2017 showing "no structural problem".</p>
      <p>A visual inspection of the 155-metre (510-foot) structure, some 6.5 metres wide, confirmed that conclusion in 2018, the environment ministry said.</p>
      <p>- 'Important crossing point' -</p>
      <p>Oget described it as a "very important crossing point" for people going to work in the regional capital Toulouse on the other side of the river.</p>
      <p>Many pedestrians use the bridge, he said, describing its collapse as a "real trauma" for the local population.</p>

      <p>Audrey Laujac, a 36-year-old woman who lives 100 metres (yards) from the scene of the accident, told AFP her son had just taken the school bus across the bridge before it collapsed.</p>
      <p>"We never imagined that the bridge might collapse," she said, her voice choked with emotion.</p>
      <p>Oget said articulated lorries were not allowed onto the bridge but that some had nonetheless been seen crossing over in the past.</p>
      <p>Police searched the premises of the drilling company that owned the truck to try to establish whether it was within the 19-tonne load limit allowed on the bridge.</p>
      <p>The issue of bridge safety was thrust into the spotlight in Europe after the collapse of a motorway bridge in the Italian city of Genoa in August 2018, in which 43 people died.</p>
      <p>An audit of France's bridges commissioned by the Senate in the wake of the Genoa disaster called for major investments to avoid a similar tragedy in France.</p>

      <p>"Unfortunately what happened illustrates what we said in the report, which is that the state of our bridges poses a real danger," Senator Herve Maure, who oversaw the audit, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"If a bridge which is not listed as dangerous collapses, what is the situation of those bridges which were clearly identified as dangerous in the report?" he asked.</p>
