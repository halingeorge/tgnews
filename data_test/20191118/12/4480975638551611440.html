      <h1>UK's Corbyn: Will set up sustainable investment board including BoE governor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:07:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>The UK opposition Labour Party's leader Jeremy Corbyn on Monday said that, if elected, they will set up a "sustainable investment board including the Bank of England governor," and added that they will be launching their manifesto on Thursday.  </p>
      <p>"It's nonsense that I am anti-business," Corbyn argued. "Major British industries like steel will struggle under a trade deal with US President Trump."</p>
      <p>These comments don't seem to be having an impact on the British pound's valuation. As of writing, the GBP/USD pair was up 0.42% on the day at 1.2955.</p>
