      <p>The honeymoon is over and South East Melbourne Phoenix are now in a dogfight.</p>
      <p>The NBL newcomers fell to their second loss of the round losing 103-91 to a resurgent Adelaide 36ers at Melbourne Arena on Monday night.</p>

      <p>The Phoenix went into this round with a 5-2 record but will come out of it 5-4 with Brisbane Bullets (4-5) and Adelaide (4-5) breathing down their necks, to make matters worse title favourites Sydney Kings come to Melbourne Arena on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Sixers never trailed as import Jerome Randle burned with 19 of his 27 points in the first half while coach Joey Wright made some telling line-up changes with rookie forward Obi Kyei and veteran Brendan Teys promoted to the starting five, import Eric Griffin playing off the bench and Ramone Moore sidelined with a "medical" issue.</p>
      <p>What set the Sixers apart was their 1-2-2 zone defence, ability to score quickly in transition and their variety of contributors as Anthony Drmic (21 points, eight rebounds), Daniel Dillon (14 points) and Griffin (17 points, seven rebounds, five assists) all produced season-best performances along with Randle.</p>
      <p>The questions asked of the Phoenix were ones they were incapable of answering as their outside shooting failed them (nine of 29 from the three-point line and 42 per cent overall), their defensive transition waned and some inexplicable turnovers appeared at the worst times.</p>
      <p>Phoenix star Mitch Creek lifted after half time with 17 of his 22 points along with 11 rebounds and three steals while John Roberson had 21 points and six assists.</p>

      <p>"We have fallen back to the pack now, we had a chance to get some separation this round and we failed," Phoenix coach Simon Mitchell said.</p>
      <p>"We are in a dogfight with everyone else but it's going to be OK."</p>
      <p>The Phoenix found some fire in the last term as Adam Gibson's three-pointer made it 78-77 with six minutes to play but Drmic nailed a three and then Phoenix veteran Ben Madgen grabbed Drmic's singlet on the next play and was called for an unsportsmanlike foul, which pushed the lead out further.</p>
      <p>"That was a pretty poor performance from us," Mitchell said.</p>
      <p>"Their 1-2-2 zone slowed us down, it was kind of the perfect storm for us as we couldn't pick up pace as we couldn't get consecutive stops and get some rhythm then they slowed us down at the offensive end as they were regularly getting buckets.</p>
      <p>"On top of that, our level of bone-headedness on some plays was pretty costly. Anytime we'd start to fight back, we'd find a way to trip ourselves up."</p>
      <p>The Phoenix also paid the price for some unhelpful fixturing from the NBL with a Monday night home game drawing a season's low crowd of 2893 fans, the game was just two days after a local derby with Melbourne United drew a sell-out crowd.</p>
      <p>Sixers coach Joey Wright praised his players and said Griffin showed what he could do when he wasn't struggling with foul trouble.</p>
      <p>He also praised Dillon's impact off the bench after the Victorian raised guard has battled back to the NBL after an achilles injury in 2017.</p>
      <p>"He was probably the biggest key," Wright said.</p>
      <p>"He stepped up, it wasn't just offence either. I thought he played some great defence, got his hand on some balls and was in position. He also gave Jerome a little break from point guard as well."</p>
      <p>The Phoenix host Sydney Kings at Melbourne Arena on Saturday at 7.30pm.</p>
