      <p>Kanye’s original <i>Jesus Is King</i> LP was released on October 25 following <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52966/title.twitter-unsurprised-with-kanye-wests-jesus-is-king-album-delay-but-jokes-fly-anyway">multiple delays</a>. The G.O.O.D. Music founder planned to drop his ninth studio album, previously titled <i>Yandhi</i>, in 2018 but scrapped that idea in favor of a gospel-style project.</p>
      <p>The <i>Jesus Is King Part II</i> tease comes on the heels of Kanye’s announcement of his first opera, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.</p>
      <p>On Sunday (November 17), the G.O.O.D. Music founder shared a Twitter invite to “A Kanye West Opera” directed by Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft.</p>
      <p>Yeezy’s opera is scheduled to take place at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon (November 24). The performance is named after an ancient Babylon king and will feature music from Kanye’s <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53317/title.kanye-west-james-corden-sunday-service-choir-conduct-airpool-karaoke">Sunday Service</a> series.</p>
      <p>Check out the invite below.</p>
