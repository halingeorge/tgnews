      <h3>Saskatoon firefighters probably know how to play cards, but the image of crews killing time as they await fire emergencies was blasted with a proverbial firehose this month.</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, the Saskatoon fire department staged a demonstration of one of the newest methods of medical care that is now being applied.</p>
      <p>Of the more than 14,000 calls the fire department received this year, 5,821 — more than 40 per cent — required emergency medical service.</p>
      <p>That’s why more than 140 of the fire department’s roughly 336 employees are now trained as primary care paramedics.</p>
      <p>Fire department staff account for about nine per cent of the city’s total workforce, about half the number employed by the Saskatoon Police Service.</p>
      <p>We learned a lot about what those 336 workers do over the past month.</p>
      <p>In addition to the emergency response expected from the fire department, there are more mundane duties, and plenty of them.</p>
      <p>Over the past five years, the fire department also dealt with 12,356 complaints about failure to maintain property, which can range from overgrown lawns to situations that pose a danger.</p>
      <p>The fire department investigated 11,444 of these property complaints, leaving more than 1,200 awaiting followup. That looks like a failure by the department when viewed on its own, but it’s pretty impressive when considered among all the other duties the department carries out.</p>
      <p>The 14,308 calls the department received in 2018 work out to 39.2 calls a day.</p>
      <p>An increasing number of those calls are coming from older adults who have taken a tumble.</p>
      <p>“Lift assists,” as the fire department calls them, accounted for 970 calls to the fire department last year and are expected to reach 999 this year. That’s 2.7 per day.</p>
      <p>As fire Chief Morgan Hackl confirmed last week, the fire department sends an entire crew of four to five firefighters, including a trained paramedic, to calls to assist fallen older adults.</p>
      <p>There’s no dealing one person out for a couple of hands of cards, because the crew must take a fire truck with them in case a more urgent call comes in. The fire department refers to a fire truck as a “frontline apparatus.”</p>
      <p>The amount of lingo you have to learn as a fire department employee is impressive on its own.</p>
      <p>Even though the fire department is working with a volunteer group and the Saskatchewan Health Authority to try to limit the number of lift assists for an individual to below five, it’s easy to imagine the need for this type of assistance growing with an aging population.</p>
      <p>As for the fire department’s core duty — snuffing out fires and saving property — the department’s annual report released last month showed $152 million in property caught fire last year and firefighters saved or protected 94 per cent of it.</p>
      <p>The department conducted 256 fire investigations and 5,317 inspections in 2018. Members of the department also collected 7,571 discarded needles last year.</p>
      <p>It’s worth remembering in the context of all of these duties that the fire department was raked over the coals (pun enthusiastically intended) in front of city council a couple of years ago for failing to adequately enforce existing backyard fire rules.</p>
      <p>And, yes, the department is also now tasked with enforcing the backyard fire time limit introduced last year.</p>
      <p>With all this, you might think Hackl would have an easy time justifying a huge budget request for the city’s first two-year budget, covering 2020 and 2021.</p>
      <p>The fire department is asking for two new employees in 2020 and none in 2021. The department’s budget is forecast to increase by 2.5 per cent in 2020, to $50.8 million, and 2.8 per cent in 2021, to $52 million.</p>
      <p>By comparison, city police are asking for 21 new employees over the two years, including a late pitch for eight new officers to monitor the area around a planned safe consumption site.</p>
      <p>Even without the eight new officers, the police budget was projected to rise by 4.5 per cent in 2020 and 4.4. per cent in 2021.</p>
      <p>Comparisons are never perfect, but it seems safe to say residents should feel like they’re getting their money’s worth from the fire department.</p>
