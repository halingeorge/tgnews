      <h1>BHP and Woodside edge closer to Scarborough decision</h1>

      <p>A final investment decision on the Scarborough gas field development is a step closer after joint venture partners Woodside and BHP announced a deal to process gas at Woodside's Pluto LNG facility on Monday.</p>
      <p>The LNG giant and BHP, who has a 25 per cent stake in the Scarborough field off WA's Pilbara coast, have inked a non-binding agreement that would see BHP make a decision on the project by mid-2020.</p>

      <p>The project has been plagued with delays thanks to drawn out negotiations between the two companies.</p>
      <p>Under the agreement gas from the untapped Scarborough field will be processed at Woodside's Pluto plant for an undisclosed toll price while BHP gives up its option to take an extra 10 per cent of the project.</p>
      <p>Woodside chief executive Peter Coleman said the agreement was a another step toward the realisation of its proposed Burrup Hub, an interconnected LNG network bringing together all of Woodside's major assets.</p>
      <p>“This agreement on tolling price, together with the increase in Scarborough gas resources announced earlier this month, provides a compelling and aligned basis for BHP and Woodside to finalise the required conditional binding agreements by the end of the first quarter of 2020," he said.</p>
      <p>“It is a key milestone as we target a go-ahead for the development of the high-quality Scarborough gas resource through an expanded Pluto LNG facility. The joint venture is now in a strong position to proceed to [final investment decision] in the first half of next year."</p>
      <p>BHP Petroleum Australia country manager Graham Salmond said it remained committed to Scarborough, which was a project that could "compete for capital within its capital allocation process."</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to align on a non-binding commercial heads of agreement with Woodside, which includes a competitive processing tariff that reflects BHP’s view on value and risk, and agreement to fully assess optimisation to process additional Scarborough gas through the North West Shelf," he said.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to work closely with Woodside to ensure Scarborough delivers value for our shareholders, partners and the community.”</p>
      <p>First LNG from Scarborough is targeted in 2024.</p>
      <p>Woodside's Burrup vision has been in the crosshairs of <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53ads.html">WA environmental groups who argue the seven individual environmental proposals lodged with state authorities obscured total greenhouse gas that would be emitted by the hub once completed.</a></p>
