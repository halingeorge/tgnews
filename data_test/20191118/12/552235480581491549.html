      <h1>Alfredo Morelos won't get Rangers more than £7million and he'll never score against Celtic - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Gary Ralston answered your calls and there was plenty of chat about Scotland, Steve Clarke, Alfredo Morelos and the Rangers Colts team.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:34:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>If you thought the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> play-offs were confusing then it has nothing on the mindset of the Tartan Army.</p>
      <p>Scotland recorded a rare victory on the road against Cyprus at the weekend ahead of the Hampden clash against Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>But the fans still weren’t entirely satisfied, claiming too much has been made over a victory that once was commonplace when Scotland qualified for major tournaments.</p>
      <p><b>Kenny Rae, Wishaw</b> said: “We’re going totally over the top about a performance that was nothing to write home about. I’ve been watching Scotland for 50 years and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> isn’t the man for the job.</p>
      <p>"We’re in the build-up to the play-offs and we’ve yet to bring a young player through. I’m a Motherwell fan but even I can see Declan Gallagher isn’t a Scotland class central defender.”</p>
      <p><b>Steven Craig, Kirkcaldy</b> said: “It has reached the stage we’ll cling to any positives, but the Scotland defence was unconvincing and it doesn’t bode well for the play-offs, whoever we end up facing.”</p>
      <p><b>Andy Stewart, Kilwinning</b> said: “I can’t agree with Michael Gannon’s praise of Declan Gallagher. He should be put in a wrestling ring, rather than a football pitch as his arms were all over the Cypriots. Clarke should also have played one of the other keepers to give them a chance. We know what David Marshall can do.”</p>

      <p><b>George Walkingshaw, Glenrothes</b> added: “I don’t know why there is so much fuss over a few players withdrawing from the national squad. However, it highlights a lack of depth and quality. Even if we don’t qualify for Euro 2020 we should not sack the manager again. We need some stability.”</p>
      <p><b>Tony Brown, East Kilbride</b> said: “Sure, let’s take the positives from the win against Cyprus, but it only underlined how ruinous so many of our performances have been in this campaign.</p>
      <p>“Has it come down to talking about revenge against Kazakhstan? A side that were thumped by Russia and Belgium and lost to Cyprus, but still managed to put three goals past us. I guess the only way is up.”</p>
      <p>However, Scotland fans are being urged to follow the path set by our Celtic cousins across the water.</p>
      <p><b>Frank McFerran, Carrickfergus</b> said: “I’ve read some shocking things by Scotland supporters aimed at their team and manager. Give the players a chance to gel. The Northern Ireland supporters always give their team a boost - and we only have a handful of Premier League players. We are always the 12th man.”</p>
      <p>The Premiership may be on international break, but the off-the-field exploits of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> continue to dominate.</p>
      <p>A broadsheet newspaper claimed a “blunder” by HMRC effectively put Rangers out of the game, a suggestion rebutted forcefully by the taxman.</p>
      <p><b>Jim McLean, Rothesay</b> said: “Whether it was £50million or £20m the bottom line is Rangers Football Club cheated and that’s why they were punished, end of story. We are fed up to the back teeth hearing about it.”</p>

      <p><b>James Brown, Glasgow</b> said: “Hotline caller John Bruce is typical of the Rangers support. He claims his club ‘could have paid the £20m comfortably’, so why didn’t they? He should dry his eyes.”</p>
      <p><b>Gordon Ashey, Ayr</b> said: “We're hearing the usual bluster from Rangers fans like Andy Adams and John Bruce, saying Rangers were robbed and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> is a world beater. Wake up and smell the coffee. HMRC made no miscalculation and the £7m rated Morelos hasn’t scored against Celtic in 10 games and never will.”</p>
      <p><b>James Robertson, Dennistoun</b> said: “I notice the ex Rangers players who were recipients of EBTs never uttered a syllable on the back of the recent story about HMRC. Why not? For once, they have been rather conspicuous by their silence.”</p>
      <p>Still, there was one call in support of the Ibrox club after their kids, under Graeme Murty, reached the semi-final of the Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p><b>Walter Eadie, Clydebank</b> said: “It’s great to see Rangers emerge from the period of turmoil under Steven Gerrard and there is clearly good work going on behind the scenes in the youth department as well.</p>
      <p>“Rangers’ Colts have gone further in this competition than any other youth side. The board can’t keep forking out money to buy new players. Hopefully we’ll see kids like Nathan Young-Coombes emerge in the next couple of years for a first team spot.”</p>
