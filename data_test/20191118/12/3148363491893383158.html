      <p>In a statement, the White House confirmed that Jon Voight, who is one of Trump’s few prominent Hollywood supporters, will be honored at a ceremony later this week for his “exceptional capacity as an actor to portray deeply complex characters.”</p>
      <p>“Captivating audiences, he has given us insights into the richness of the human mind and heart,” the statement read.</p>

      <p>Voight, who won the Academy Award for best actor in 1978 for his role as veteran Luke Martin in <i>Coming Home</i>, is a fervent supporter of the president. Earlier this year, the star declared President Trump the “greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.”</p>
      <p>“Our country is stronger, safer and with more jobs, because our president has made his every move correct,” he said Voight, who is the father of actress Angelina Jolie. “Don’t be fooled by the political left because we are the people of this nation that is witnessing triumph.”</p>
