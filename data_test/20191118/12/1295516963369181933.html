          <b>WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for the latest episode of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/watchmen-tv/">Watchmen</a>, "Little Fear of Lightning," which premiered Sunday on HBO.</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Since <i>Watchmen</i>'s premiere, audiences have watched Adrian Veidt (Jeremy Irons) operate apart from the primary drama of the HBO drama. While most of the characters are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and dealing with the murder of police Chief Judd Crawford, the man once known as Ozymandias has been riding on horseback in green pastures, growing tomatoes and living in a castle. His only companions are a mysterious game warden, seemingly tasked with keeping him in line, and Mr. Phillips and Ms. Crookshanks, servant clones who are both obedient and numerous. However,it became clear Veidt wasn't on this "country estate" by choice.</p>

      <p>We've seen the character's creative, if completely mad, attempts to escape the compound. The clues indicated he was constructing some sort of astronaut suit -- but to what end, we didn't know. While some had assumed Veidt was somewhere on Earth, last week's episode, "If You Don't Like My Story, Write Your Own," seemed to indicate he was ... <a href="https://www.cbr.com/watchmen-adrian-veidt-prisoner-space-possibility/">elsewhere</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, with "Little Fear of Lightning," we have our answer: Adrian Veidt is off-planet, but not on Earth's moon, or even on Mars, with Doctor Manhattan. Instead, he appears to be stranded on one of Jupiter's moons.</p>

      <p>In "If You Don't Like My Story, Write Your Own," Adrian Veidt spent most of his time catapulting the bodies of his dead servants into the distance. We saw the bodies disappear behind the clouds, as the so-called Smartest Man in the World attempted to build a functioning suit that would allow its wearer the ability to survive to freezing vacuum of space. Now, in <i>Watchmen</i>'s latest episode, it's finally time for Veidt to put on the suit and follow through with his plan.</p>
      <p>Loading himself into the catapult, he is shot into the blue skies over his luscious green lands. But eventually, he phases through a barrier, and suddenly he is no longer on his pastures. Instead, he is in the dark, on the rocky surface of a moon. As he looks beyond him in triumph, we see planet Jupiter in orbit and much further behind it, Mars.</p>

      <p>Of course, we still have no idea why Adrian is being kept prisoner on this moon or how he got there four years ago. The series revealed that after living on the run from the authorities for years, Veidt was later declared dead, although the FBI had no solid proof of this. But the reason he could no longer be found is now revealed: he hasn't been on Earth for some time now.</p>
      <p>Somehow, his prison is invisible, even to him when looking from the outside in. The only way for him to get back in is thanks to the wire that is connected to his suit. The technology at work in this place, that allows a full, breathable biosphere to exist on a moon undetected and invisible, is so advanced that we can't help but wonder if it isn't technology at all. Could it instead be the work of Doctor Manhattan?</p>

      <p>On the moon's surface, Ozymandias assembles the scores of dead bodies he has thrown out of his prison and writes a message for a nearby satellite to see: "Save me." However, upon closer inspection, the message is partially obstructed. What we actually can read is "Save me d.' As it turns out, the satellite isn't the only thing in the sky -- Mars is also there, and Doctor Manhattan is believed to still be living on the red planet.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, Ozymandias' message could be for his former teammate, asking him for an interplanetary rescue. Could the message actually read "Save me, Dr.?" If that's the case, this could pave the way for two stars of the original <i>Watchmen</i> series to reunite for the first time on the HBO show.</p>
      <p><i>Developed by Damon Lindelof, HBO's </i>Watchmen<i> stars Jeremy Irons, Regina King, Don Johnson, Tim Blake Nelson, Jean Smart, Louis Gossett Jr., Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Tom Mison, James Wolk, Adelaide Clemens, Andrew Howard, Frances Fisher, Jacob Ming-Trent, Sara Vickers, Dylan Schombing, Lily Rose Smith and Adelynn Spoon.
