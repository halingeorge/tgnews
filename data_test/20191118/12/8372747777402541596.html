      <p>POLK COUNTY, Fla. â€” A Lakeland man was arrested after deputies say he punched a little league umpire in the face.</p>
      <p>It happened Friday evening at Highland City Ball Park at 3930 Ball Park Rd.</p>
      <p>According to the affidavit, 22-year-old Alberto Escartin Ramos disagreed with a call an umpire made, so after the game he went to the clubhouse to complain.</p>
      <p>Ramos allegedly began to scream at the umpire, and the umpire asked him to leave the ballpark.</p>
      <p>Ramos responded by screaming that he would "kick his a**" and then punched him in the face, cutting the umpire's lip and breaking one of his teeth.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Ramos was at the field watching his nephew play the day of the incident.</p>
      <p>"This is completely inexcusable." Sheriff Grady Judd said. "Assaulting a little league official while he's officiating at a game where children are supposed to be having fun, and learning sportsmanlike behavior. Not only was he arrested, he's also been trespassed from the ballpark."</p>
      <p>Ramos faces a felony battery charge for the incident.</p>
