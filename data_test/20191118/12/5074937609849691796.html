      <p>Winneba C/R, Nov. 18, A District Magistrate Court in Winneba presided over by Mr. Charles Oheneba-Kufour has remanded into prison custody two men  allegedly accused of their involvement in an armed robbery operation at the residence of a Police officer in Winneba .</p>
      <p>The pleas of Vincent Gagadosu 29, unemployed and Maxwell Bortey, 24, a bus conductor, were not taken and will reappear before the court on Tuesday, November 26.</p>
      <p>Chief Superintendent Godfrey Tetteh Adjirakor in charge of Winneba District Police Command, who narrated the facts at the weekend said on November 7 at about 2045 hours Gagadosu, Bortey and two others now on at large, armed themselves with a Pistol, Knifes and other dangerous items and sneaked into the residence of a Senior Police officer in Winneba who was at then attending a course.</p>
      <p>He said the robbers attacked the wife of the officer immediately she drove onto their compound and parked her Toyota Camry Saloon vehicle.</p>
      <p>He said they marched her into their room and attacked her two young kids and two female adults who were in the house, tied their hands with ropes and covered their mouths with tapes.</p>
      <p>Mr Adjirakor said they robbed the household and took away one Hp Lab-top Computer, three cell phones, cash amounting to Six Hundred Ghana Cedis and thence packed their booty into the victim’s Toyota Saloon car and sped off.</p>
      <p>Chief Superintendent Adjirakor said the next day the two suspects were arrested from their hideout at Nungua through intelligence report.</p>
      <p> The District Commander said the Toyota Camry Saloon Car was later found on November 10, and that efforts were being made to apprehend the other two accomplices believed to be hiding in Ashiaman in the Greater Accra Region.</p>
