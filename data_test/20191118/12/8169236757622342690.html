        <b>Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho ignored a warning about signing Romelu Lukaku from Everton in the summer of 2017.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Toffees chief Steve Walsh has revealed to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">The Athletic</a> that he spoke to Mourinho about the transfer and warned him Lukaku was a ‘big baby’.</p>

      <p>“You have to work out what you want and need,” he said. “Don’t try to attract players with no plan: ‘He’s available so we will take him.’</p>
      <p>“Alexis Sanchez is a good example. During the title-winning season we only lost three times but two of those were against Arsenal. They pasted us at Leicester, 5-2. We played well and Jamie scored a remarkable goal, but Sanchez was outstanding that day. He was instrumental in both games.</p>
      <p>“But it is not about collecting players, it is about having a clear plan and a strategy of how you want to play.</p>
      <p>“When Jose signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, I remember saying to him, ‘You have to be careful with Lukaku. He is a big baby, you know.’ He said he could handle him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he really got Lukaku on-side mentally, which you have to do. That is the case with him and Paul Pogba. They aren’t my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team. I wouldn’t have touched them.”</p>
      <p>This seems rather harsh on the Belgium international, who was a big hit during his time at Goodison Park and who has generally had a fine career at the highest level of the game.</p>
      <p>Lukaku didn’t exactly hit top form in his time at Old Trafford, but has once again shone since leaving for Inter Milan this summer.</p>
      <p>While there may be question-marks over his mentality as he seemed to lose confidence at United, it’s hard to take Walsh’s assessment that he’s a big baby particularly seriously.</p>
      <p>Mourinho certainly seemed willing to gamble on Lukaku anyway, and he’s worked with some of the biggest characters in the game throughout his managerial career.</p>
