      <p>THE IRELAND SQUAD for tonight’s crucial Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark at the Aviva Stadium has been confirmed. </p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s 23-man squad sees Callum O’Dowda and Scott Hogan dropped, with Troy Parrott and Jack Byrne both included.</p>
      <p>Bristol City winger O’Dowda and Stoke City striker Hogan were both used from the bench in the away game against Switzerland, with the former also coming on as a 55th-minute substitute in Ireland’s 3-1 friendly win over New Zealand last week.</p>
      <p>Dublin duo Parrott (17) and Byrne benefit in their absence, after bright showings against the All Whites. Robbie Brady and first-choice, fit-again keeper Darren Randolph have also made the cut.</p>
      <p>Shane Duffy captains the side for the first time with Seamus Coleman suspended for what is an effective play-off with Denmark for a place at Euro 2020.</p>
