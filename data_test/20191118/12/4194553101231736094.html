      <h1>(Video) Jurgen Klopp celebrating appears in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour railways promise</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:37:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn posted a video on Twitter this morning that shows a Labour promise of better railways should his party win the upcoming general election…</p>
      <p>In it, a famous video of Jurgen Klopp fist-pumping has been used to show how delight in ‘much cheaper’ fares for all – as Corbyn promises to run the railways ‘for people, not profit’.</p>
      <p>Having regularly been delayed on incredibly expensive trains going up and down the country to follow football – this seems like a great idea!</p>
      <p>You can vote in the general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>
