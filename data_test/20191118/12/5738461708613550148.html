      <p>After a particularly cold night last night, local weather expert Louth Weather has offered up the forecast for the week ahead, today being the pick of the week.</p>
      <p>"Monday is my pick of the week. Then it's milder, but wetter and windier mid week. Cloudy and drier later in the week. More unsettled again on Sunday and into the early days of the following week.</p>
