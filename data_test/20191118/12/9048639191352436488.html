      <p><b>(CNN) - </b>A cat food company is issuing a nationwide recall over possible salmonella contamination.</p>
      <p>The Utah-based company Go Raw is recalling its Quest brand 2-pound frozen bags of beef cat food.</p>
      <p>The recall was put into place after the Minnesota Department of Agriculture found a sample tested positive for salmonella.</p>
      <p>Federal health officials say salmonella can not only affect animals that eat the products but can be a risk to humans who handle it.</p>
