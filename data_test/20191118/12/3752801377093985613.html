      <p>A 15-year-old boy was killed in a shootout in Ottery, Western Cape police said on Monday.</p>
      <p>No one has been arrested for the incident in Frank Way, which occurred at around 22:20 on Friday, police spokesperson Colonel Andr√® Traut said.</p>
      <p>Grassy Park Community Police Forum spokesperson Philip Bam said it was sad that another innocent person had died as a result of gun violence.</p>
      <p>"Apparently, it was crossfire from two gangsters shooting at each other," he said.</p>
      <p>Bam said the teen and his mother had been walking in the vicinity when they were injured. He later died.</p>
      <p>"The police say they are doing their best but the guns need to be removed from our area and unfortunately, the guns are popping up all over the show."</p>
      <p>Traut said they were investigating the circumstances of the shooting.</p>
