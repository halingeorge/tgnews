      <p>Amazon has some of Sony's most popular headphones ever, on sale for just $128. That's good for nearly 50-percent off of their regular price. Of course, this is part of its Gold Box Deal of the Day, so this is going to be good today only. And you'll want to grab it before midnight PST.</p>
      <p>Best Buy's Doorbuster today is for the Beats Studio 3, which are on sale for just $199. That is actually the same price we've seen advertised for the Beats Studio 3 for Black Friday. So why wait another week and a half to get them on Black Friday when you can get the same price now. And have them in time for Thanksgiving – to ignore your annoying family.</p>
      <p>It's time to step up your audio game, with a new sound bar. And Amazon has the Sony HT-S350 Soundbar with wireless subwoofer on sale for just $198 right now. This is down from its regular price of $278. It also has some really good audio quality, thanks to that wireless sub that is going to give you some deep bass. And that sound bar that just sounds amazing. We all know that Sony knows audio.</p>

      <p>Amazon has brought back one of its all-time most popular Amazon Music Unlimited promotions. Where you can get four months of the service for just $0.99. That is a pretty crazy deal. And gives you a good few months to check out the service, before you need to pay the full price – which is $8 per month. Amazon Music Unlimited has millions of songs available, as well as curated radio stations. And it of course works on Alexa.</p>
      <p>These deals are all available until midnight PST on the expiration date specified below. These prices are also as up-to-date as possible, but beware that prices will fluctuate throughout the day.
