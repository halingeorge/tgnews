      <h1>Opinion: Calgary should lead way in adopting definition of anti-Semitism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:00:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>As the threat of anti-Semitism intensifies across Canada and the world, the proposal before Calgary’s city council to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s Working Definition of Anti-Semitism could not be timelier.</p>
      <p>In today’s political climate, there is a disturbing resurgence of anti-Semitism. Synagogues and Jewish communal institutions have come under attack throughout the world – including in Pittsburgh, San Diego and Halle, Germany, within a span of less than a year. Canada is not immune to this scourge, as Statistics Canada has found Jews to be the ethnocultural group most frequently targeted for hate crimes in our country. Alarmingly, B’nai Brith Canada’s annual audit of anti-Semitic Incidents recorded 2,041 acts of anti-Semitism in Canada in 2018, a record high for the third consecutive year.</p>
      <p>Speaking about this very issue, renowned Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt once stated that “No healthy democratic society can harbour that kind of animus, that kind of hatred, and be called a healthy society.” For those who care deeply about upholding Canada’s democratic values, she is right — our democracy is under threat when any portion of its population does not feel safe under the law.</p>
      <p>As with any problem, the first step towards tackling it involves an accurate definition. The IHRA definition is the most comprehensive, historically accurate and practically effective tool for understanding the unique threat of anti-Semitism in all its forms. As one might expect, the definition addresses overt expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment, such as those used by white supremacists and radical Islamist terrorists. It also, however, draws clear guidelines for differentiating between criticizing policies of the State of Israel, as everyone has the right to do in any free society, and using the State of Israel as an excuse to openly peddle anti-Jewish views and rhetoric.</p>
      <p>The IHRA definition is especially useful in explaining the threat that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement poses to Jewish Canadians. On university campuses and in political arenas across our country, the movement presents itself as a harmless method of political protest, but actually has more sinister goals and tactics. This movement, which obsessively criticizes and singles out Israel, the world’s only Jewish state, has been officially recognized by the Canadian Parliament as anti-Semitic in nature because it subjects Israel to different standards, delegitimization and demonization faced by no other country — not even the world’s brutal and repressive dictatorships which deserve to be singled out for their flagrant human rights abuses.</p>
      <p>As well, this movement, which often gets away with preaching hatred, is very often responsible for incitement against Jewish Canadians by targeting them — a clear example of discrimination based on ethnic and religious background. By outlining the differences between legitimate criticisms of Israeli government policy and Jew-hatred masked under the guise of political activity, this definition addresses a serious, dangerous and very real threat for many people that, until now, has largely gone unchallenged.</p>
      <p>The significance of the IHRA definition is evidenced by the fact that it has already been adopted by 33 countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany. While governments, large and small, continue to make progress on this issue around the world, no major Canadian city has adopted this definition at the local level.</p>
      <p>In times like this, taking a stand is the only appropriate course of action. If we do not clearly define and understand anti-Semitism, we cannot possibly emerge with an effective plan for combating the threats we face. All levels of government must have a clear and consistent definition of what anti-Semitism is in order to effectively address it. By choosing to adopt the IHRA definition, Calgary will not only make a substantial difference on this issue but can set the right example for Canada’s other major cities.</p>
