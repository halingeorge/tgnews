      <h1>Half Life: Alyx is a VR exclusive coming in March 2020 – report</h1>

        <b>A recent rumour suggests that Valve will unveil Half Life: Alyx at The Game Awards this December, acting as a new chapter in the iconic shooter’s universe. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The report comes from a leaker known as “Midoryan” who is known previously to have unveiled the existence of Dota Underlords, adding some weight to this new leak’s credibility. </p>
      <p>Half Life: Alyx will be a VR exclusive launching in March 2020, according to the report. It remains unknown whether it will carry on the narrative cliffhanger left behind by Half Life 2: Episode 2, which launched alongside The Orange Box over a decade ago. </p>
      <p>November 19 will mark the 19th anniversary of the original Half Life, and will apparently be when Valve will spill the beans on Half Life: Alyx ahead of its formal reveal at The Game Awards next month, but we’ll believe it when we see it. </p>

      <p>The report quotes an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7Dke__WLzyTzDg1omSrSzy5alzbUhsC8kZZ8anAhqk/preview">interview</a> between Geoff Keighley and Robin Walker (co-creator of Team Fortress 2) and an unnamed third individual who many believe is Gabe Newell himself. </p>
      <p>“I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard, but like as we said, it began as an exploration of VR,” reads the transcript when someone is questioning about bringing Half Life into the world of virtual reality. </p>
      <p>We have no idea how Half Life: Alyx will play, but it will presumably be a first-person shooter experience through the medium of VR, which the interview alludes to: “You can see their whole body– Respond to the situation. You know, panicking, dropping clips on the ground as they fumble their weapons ’cause a zombie’s in front of them, all these things, they’re just – it’s been really fun watching playtests.”</p>
      <p>Time will tell whether this project becomes a reality, since it’s certainly one we’d love to play for ourselves. Half Life 2 and its episodic sequences are all wonderful, acting as some of the genre’s highest watermarks. If they can pull off the same iconic impact in virtual reality, we’re in for a treat.</p>
