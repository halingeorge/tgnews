      <h1>Addition of in-patient beds reducing wait times at Calder Centre</h1>

      <p>After the addition of six adult residential treatment beds earlier this year, wait times at the Calder Centre have fallen to an average of two weeks.</p>

      <h3>Wait times at Saskatoon’s Calder Centre, which once hovered around six to 12 weeks, now sit at an average of two weeks.</h3>
      <p>The Calder Centre offers addictions treatment programs, including four-week in-patient care and out-patient treatment. In June, it added six new adult treatment beds, bringing the total number to 38. The average length of wait times prior to the addition would be up to 12 weeks, depending on the patient’s gender, since sometimes there were more female patient beds than male patient beds, for example.</p>
      <p>For the last couple of months, wait times fell and the Saskatchewan Health Authority, which operates the centre, has been able to admit people directly out of social detox, said Tracy Muggli, director of mental health and addictions community services for the SHA in Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>The SHA prioritizes pregnant women and people who are HIV positive for safety reasons, she added.</p>
      <p>If someone expresses interest in residential treatment, they are immediately connected to an outpatient counsellor at the SHA’s office in the Sturdy Stone building, Muggli said. During a meeting, the counsellor can help the person determine the right kind of treatment plan. They would then need a medical assessment from a general practitioner.</p>
      <p>A stay in residential treatment lasts for a month, but can be longer if needed. Muggli said it takes a bit of time for someone to make the decision to step away from their other responsibilities in life for a month or more. They may want to take some time to get things in order, while some may want to detox, so the SHA organizes their admission to the social detox centre to help them do this safely, she said.</p>
      <p>“We do recognize that sometimes people may want to go fairly quickly and there might not be a bed available immediately, and that is one of the reasons that we’re proceeding with pre- and post-treatment beds.”</p>
      <p>Whether someone is admitted into residential treatment versus other treatment options is defined by where the person is at and what they need, as well as the outcome they seek — abstinence or harm reduction, Muggli said.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-health-authority-seeks-proposals-for-50-new-addiction-treatment-beds">The SHA issued a request for proposals in September to develop 50 residential pre- and post-addictions treatment beds across the province. The beds would be geared toward treating addictions to substances including crystal meth, opioids and alcohol.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The beds would be available to people from the time they’re assessed at a detox centre until they can go into treatment and then “step down” beds for the period after residential treatment, Muggli said.</p>
      <p>The SHA is also developing a Rapid Access Addiction Medicine program, which the SHA expects to have in operation by spring.</p>
