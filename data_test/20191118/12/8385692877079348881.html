      <p>We have some good news for HONOR flagship users. Android 10 is now <a href="https://club.hihonor.com/in/topic/466203/detail.htm">rolling out</a> to the HONOR 20, 20 Pro, and View 20. Those three devices are the very latest flagship offerings from <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/huawei">Huawei</a>'s subsidiary.</p>
      <h3>Android 10 coming to the HONOR 20, 20 Pro &amp; View 20 with Magic UI 3.0</h3>
      <p>Android 10 is coming with Magic UI 3.0 on those three smartphones. This is a global variant of Android 10 that we're talking about here, by the way.</p>
      <p>The update has begun rolling out to those three devices globally, but it may take a while before all of you get it. The rollout is going out in phases, so it has not been pushed out for every single device just yet. If everything goes according to plan, though, it will reach all phones within a week or two.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>This update weighs 4.63GB, in case you're wondering, so it's a hefty one. That's not that surprising, though, considering that a brand new iteration of Android is coming, along with HONOR's additions.</p>
      <p>The global variant of this update was spotted with a build number 10.0.0.168 (C431E9R3P7). Your update may come with a different build number, though, as we're sure that more than one variant is rolling out.</p>
      <p>Your phone can be updated via the HiCare app, or the system updater. The phone will notify you once the OTA update is available for your device, though you can always check manually as well.</p>

      <p>Android 10 update brings quite a few changes to the HONOR 20, 20 Pro, and the View 20. You will get Android 10's brand new privacy controls, along with some design changes inspired by Google's latest Android version.</p>
      <p>Your UI will look considerably different than the stock one, though. HONOR's phones come with Magic UI pre-installed, and Magic UI 3.0 brings a number of changes compared to v2.0.</p>
      <h3>The update includes a 'Magazine Design', dynamic animations, and more</h3>
      <p>You'll get a new Magazine Design with this update, along with a Morandi color scheme. Dynamic animations are also included in the package, by the way.</p>

      <p>HONOR will also deliver a number of improvements to the GPU Turbo feature, while the Phone Clone feature will also be included.</p>
      <p>Media playback-related improvements are also rolling out as we speak, along with a number of additional changes that you can check out it the included image.</p>
      <p>This global update arrived to the HONOR 20, 20 Pro, and View 20 sooner than we expected. The P30 and P30 Pro also started receiving Android 10 a couple of days ago, and HONOR seems to have been just as fast this time around.</p>
