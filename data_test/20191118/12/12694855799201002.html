      <h1>Wikipedia’s Jimmy Wales is taking on Facebook and Twitter with a social network that fights fake news</h1>

        <b>The co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, </b>
        <b>has unveiled a new social network that’s designed to go against the ad-funded models loved by Facebook, Google and Twitter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the social network seems to take its cues from the donation-based editable content found on Wikipedia which – while not quite a beacon of trust – is already a household name when it comes to reading up on any and every subject under the sun. <a href="https://wt.social/">WT:Social</a> is funded by its users, and every post is editable – by everyone.</p>

      <p>Wales plans to use the ad-free model to fight back against the “fake news and low quality content” that can be found, well, all over on its competitors’ sites.</p>
      <p>As a social network, WT:Social will presumably be home to more voices and opinions than Wikipedia. It isn’t yet clear how the user-moderated content system will tackle conflicting opinions and where the community will draw the line on fake news.</p>
      <p>Wales explained the thought process behind WT:Social in a <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/1192160194693718017">Twitter</a> thread shared earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“Existing social networks work on a pure advertising business model”, explained Wales. “This drives them to addict you, to keep you on the site. Their incentives are in the direction of outrage, radical discourse, trolling − not your human flourishing”.</p>
      <p>“But I have a different idea: if only *some* people pay (maybe you! maybe not! pay if you want) then it can be free for everyone else. I think the people who will pay will be the ones who care the most about fixing the broken Internet culture that leads horribleness.”</p>

      <p>WT:Social is currently working on its infrastructure, leaving free users in a waiting list at the moment, but there is an option to skip the list by subscribing to the service or by inviting others to create an account.</p>
      <p>A subscription will set you back £10 a month or £80 a year in the UK.</p>
