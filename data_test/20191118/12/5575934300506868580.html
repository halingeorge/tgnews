      <p>Adam Neumann reportedly compared WeWork to Amazon to make its astronomical valuation look cheap by comparison.</p>
      <p>WeWork’s cofounder and then-CEO presented the coworking startup to a handful of Wall Street analysts in July as a dry run before its IPO road show, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90426446/wefail-how-the-doomed-masa-son-adam-neumann-relationship-set-wework-on-the-road-to-disaster">according to Fast Company</a>. Neumann compared WeWork to Amazon when it only sold books and music, and pledged to expand from desk rentals into education, exercise, networking, and other sectors just as the e-commerce titan widened its offering, the magazine reported.</p>
      <p>Neumann hoped the analogy would make WeWork’s targeted public valuation of $US65 billion more digestible for investors, given Amazon was valued north of $US900 billion at the time, Fast Company said.</p>
      <p>The pitch went well: several analysts requested selfies with Neumann afterward, a person familiar with the event told the magazine.</p>
      <p>Masayoshi Son – CEO of SoftBank, WeWork’s biggest investor – helped Neumann and his team to craft the Amazon narrative, Fast Company reported. Before filing to go public, WeWork rebranded as The We Company to reflect its broader ambitions.</p>
      <p>“Masa is a Jedi,” Neumann told Fast Company in January. “He has a lot of superpowers.”</p>
      <p>However, the Jedi mind trick was revealed after WeWork filed for an IPO. Investors railed against its ballooning losses, unproven business model, limited governance, and Neumann’s overwhelming control and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wework-ipo-adam-neumann-business-model-valuation-2019-9-1028530754?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">controversial behaviour</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/weworks-nightmare-ipo-2019-9">The backlash</a> meant WeWork faced the prospect of going public at a fraction of the $US47 billion private valuation it secured in January, and falling short of raising the $US3 billion needed to unlock $US6 billion in bank financing. It decided to scrap its IPO, Neumann stepped down, and the startup accepted a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/softbank-agrees-to-rescue-wework-in-a-bailout-deal-2019-10">$US9.5 billion rescue deal</a> from SoftBank last month.</p>
