      <h1>Hit restaurant Rezdôra brings the taste of Italy to NYC</h1>

      <p>Ask chef Stefano Secchi about the appeal of the cuisine of Emilia-Romagna, the central Italian region to which he’s devoted <a href="https://rezdora.nyc/">Rezdôra</a>, his 6-month-old haute-pasta mecca in Gramercy, and he points to three things: Parmesan cheese, prosciutto ham and balsamic vinegar. “That’s the holy trinity right there,” he says of the region’s most famous products.</p>
      <p>At Rezdôra, Secchi is sourcing top examples of each, from purveyors he knows from his time in Italy, to create dishes that celebrate the culinary traditions of Emilia-Romagna.</p>
      <p>Son of an Italian father and English mother, the chef grew up between the US and Italy, but developed his palate in his dad’s homeland. “I would eat pasta four or five times a day,” he recalls. His favorite was tortellini in brodo, a recipe native to Emilia-Romagna.</p>
      <p>Eventually, he went to work in the region — often referred to as Italy’s breadbasket — whose capital, Bologna, has the nickname “la grassa,” meaning the fat one, because of its rich cuisine. Cooking both high and low, modernist and traditional, he spent time in the kitchens of the three-Michelin-star Osteria Francescana, Massimo Bottura’s contemporary reinvention of elevated Italian gastronomy, and he also worked “with the nonnas” he says. “From them, I learned the basis of Emilia-Romagna cuisine, rolling out pasta, and I bring that training to the table at Rezdôra.” (Not incidentally, the name of the restaurant means “grandmother” in Modena’s dialect.)</p>
      <p>Secchi chose the region for his restaurant because it’s the birthplace of pasta al uovo — pasta enriched with egg, not just made with flour and water. “I wanted to build a place where I could make pasta al uovo every single day,” he says.</p>

      <p>The dish that concludes Rezdôra’s five-course pasta tasting menu shows off some particularly special versions of that holy trinity of ingredients.</p>
      <p>Secchi upgrades traditional meat anolini di Parma with a filling that includes 24-month-old prosciutto, topped by a creamy sauce of long-aged Parmigiano-Reggiano. They’re finished tableside with a drizzle of syrupy, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar that he imports from his favorite producer in Modena: Pedroni, a family business in operation since 1862.</p>
      <p>“I fell in love with those flavors,” Secchi says of his time working in the region with these products. “The acidity and sweetness of balsamico; the different ages, textures and flavors of Parmigiano, the greatest cheese in the world; and then prosciutto, the king of all hams.”</p>
      <p>As for what’s making Rezdôra’s homage to Emilia-Romagna so popular, Secchi says, “We take liberties, but we hold true to tradition. We don’t make Americanized Italian food; we make true cibo Italiano, and that won’t change.”</p>
