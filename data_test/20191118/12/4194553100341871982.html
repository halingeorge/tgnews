      <h1>Casillas says it would defy ‘logic’ for Ronaldo to win Ballon d’Or over Van Dijk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:19:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Iker Casillas, the legendary former Spain and Real Madrid keeper, has a soft spot for the current Liverpool side – <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/10/iker-casillas-tweets-about-liverpools-brilliance-during-city-game/">having recently made a point of hailing our front-three.</a></p>
      <p>But it seems he also has been impressed by Virgil van Dijk – a player he thinks should be considered for the Ballon d’Or alongside Lionel Messi and not Cristiano Ronaldo…</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Van Dijk was the best player for UEFA, Messi was the best for FIFA. Imagine if Cristiano wins the Ballon d’Or? It would seem to me that the guidelines we follow in football to give prizes do not have much logic,” the former Madrid goalkeeper tweeted, via the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/virgil-van-dijk-ballon-dor-17273660">Echo</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Van Dijk won the Champions League and helped Liverpool to 97 points in the Premier League last season – and has played a huge part in our unbeaten start to this campaign.</p>
      <p>Messi helped Barca win La Liga and has again posted incomparable offensive numbers – in terms of not only goals but creativity – too.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has had his moments, but based on the calendar year of 2019, he should be nowhere near the running – despite his undeniably legendary status.</p>
      <p>Journalists vote for the Ballon d’Or, though, not fans on Twitter – so hopefully the actual performances and achievements since January 1 will be properly taken into account.</p>
      <p>We strongly believe Virgil will get the nod, which be an exceptional achievement for the best defender we’ve seen in the Premier League era.</p>
