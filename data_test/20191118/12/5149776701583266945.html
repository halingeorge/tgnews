      <p>For more than two years, Darren Steels and his partner were bewildered by the double plug socket in the kitchen of their home in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/hucknall">Hucknall</a>.</p>
      <p>It was in a good location near the bottom of the stairs.</p>
      <p>But it had never worked since they bought the property in Bolingey Way back in July 2017. And that was a source of some frustration for the couple.</p>
      <p>"We tried to plug things into it,” said Darren. “It's perfectly placed for vacuuming the stairs, instead of having the cord running across the kitchen floor.”</p>
      <p>The socket didn’t feel loose or anything, and when the couple had decorators in to redo the kitchen soon after they moved in, nothing was flagged up.</p>
      <p>“People have just painted around it,” the 45-year-old added.</p>
      <p>Eventually, they decided to ask an electrician to try and sort it out.</p>
      <p>"I was just fed up with it," Darren said. "We had an electrician come round to do some other bits and bobs and I asked him to have a look at it."</p>
      <p>The electrician confirmed there was no current to the socket, before trying to tackle the problem in a different way.</p>
      <p>“He prised it open, and it came away from the wall,” added restaurant manager Darren.</p>
      <p>And what was revealed was - a secret safe.</p>
      <p>Sadly, though, it wasn’t filled with cash or valuables. "There was just dust, fluff and a dead spider in it."</p>
      <p>He posted a video of it online on Sunday, November 17 - and people have been loving it, with more than 60,000 views so far.  </p>

      <p>"I have a socket that doesnt work....absolutely checking it later!!" said one Twitter user.</p>
      <p>"Thats both hilarious and sort of James Bond," said Martyn.</p>
      <p>"I always wanted one of those as a kid," said Paul.</p>
      <p>"Don’t store anything too valuable in there now," warned Craig. "People will know!! Brilliant idea though. Alf &amp; Audrey had one on Coronation Street."</p>
      <p>"I remember seeing those in the Argos catalogues in the 90’s," said Gaz. "Always wanted one."</p>
      <p>The safe should have a key which slots into one of the the holes for the plug pins, but it was unlocked - and Darren said he didn't have the key for it.</p>
      <p>However, he said he would be keeping the safe as it was, for "posterity".</p>
