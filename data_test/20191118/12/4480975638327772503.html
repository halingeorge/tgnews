      <h1>Gold Technical Analysis: Bears likely to aim towards multi-month lows, around $1445 region</h1>

          <b>On offers for the second straight session amid renewed trade optimism.</b>
        </li>

          <b>The near-term technical set-up remains tilted in favour of bearish traders.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">Gold</a> added to the previous session's modest losses and remained under some selling pressure for the second consecutive session on Monday, erasing all of the gains recorded last week.<br/> <br/>Given that the precious metal stalled its attempted recovery from three-month lows near a confluence support breakpoint turned <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, the set-up seems tilted in favour of bearish traders.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily chart maintained their bearish bias and have again started gaining negative traction on hourly charts, reinforcing the negative outlook for the commodity.<br/> <br/>Hence, some follow-through weakness back towards $1455 horizontal support en-route last week’s swing lows, around the $1445 region, remains a distinct possibility amid renewed trade optimism.<br/> <br/>The latter coincides with 38.2% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the $1265-$1557 bullish move, which if broken might be seen as a key trigger for bearish traders and pave the way for a further depreciating move.<br/> <br/>Below the mentioned support, the commodity is likely to accelerate the slide further towards $1432-30 intermediate support before eventually dropping to 50% Fibo. support near the $1414-12 region.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, the $1470-75 zone might continue to act as an immediate strong resistance, which if cleared decisively might trigger a bout of short-covering and lift the metal towards the $1490 region.</p>
