      <h1>Rise of Stefanos Tsitsipas signals new era for men’s tennis</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:50:58+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Rafael Nadal will end the year as the world’s top-ranked player and the “big three” retained their stranglehold on the Grand Slam titles, but when Stefanos Tsitsipas was crowned ATP Finals champion it felt like a watershed moment.</p>
      <p>“I believe I’m really close on being crowned a Grand Slam champion. I know these are strong words that I say, but I do feel like I belong to be there,” the 21-year-old Greek boldly claimed after beating Austria’s Dominic Thiem.</p>
      <p>There have been false dawns before of course. Germany’s Alexander Zverev, like Tsitsipas, was also 21 last year when he beat Novak Djokovic to win the season-ender in London.</p>
      <p>Zverev could not back it up in this year’s grand slam events, two of which were won by the 33-year-old Nadal and two by the 32-year-old Djokovic.</p>
      <p>They have 19 and 16 majors each while Roger Federer, at 38, will still believe he can add to the record 20 he has accumulated during his extraordinary career.</p>
      <p>But for the first time, that golden trio will be having an anxious glance over their shoulders.</p>
      <p>Thiem, 26, got the ball rolling when he beat Federer on the opening day of the ATP’s exclusive year-ender.</p>
      <p>The following day Germany’s Zverev beat Nadal for the first time in his career and Tsitsipas marked his tournament debut by beating 23-year-old Russian Daniil Medvedev, who reached this year’s US Open final.</p>
      <p>Thiem then beat Djokovic and Tsitsipas silenced the Federer fan club to eclipse the six-time champion in straight sets to reach the final.</p>
      <p>With Nadal and Djokovic bumped out in the group, the Swiss maestro’s semi-final defeat meant it was only the third time since 2002 that at least one of that trio had not reached the decider.</p>
      <p>That may have disappointed some, but the quality and intensity of Sunday’s final in which Tsitsipas beat Thiem 6-7 (6-8) 6-2 7-6 (7-4) to become the youngest champion at the season-ending tournament since 20-year-old Australian Lleyton Hewitt in 2001, had the O2 Arena audience enthralled.</p>
      <p>“I remember myself watching this event on TV and thinking, ‘Oh, these guys have done an insane year to be playing here,”‘ the 21-year-old Tsitsipas said.</p>
      <blockquote>And now I’m in the position to be champion, so it feels awesome.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’s been quite a journey for Tsitsipas, who first met Thiem at London’s O2 in 2016 when he was the world’s top-ranked junior and was invited to be a hitting partner for the ATP Finals participants.</p>
      <p>“That is unbelievable,” Tsitsipas said when reminded of that day.</p>
      <p>“I just remembered (that), first time I met Dominic was I came here as a sparring partner. I think my first hit was with Dominic.</p>
      <p>“It’s unbelievable, isn’t it? We are now facing each other in the final.”</p>
      <p>It was quite a final, too.</p>
      <p>The win caps a breakthrough season for Tsitsipas, who reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open, won two ATP titles and became the first Greek man to break into the top 10.</p>
      <p>The world No.6 also leaves London with $2.6 million ($A3.8m) in prize money.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas has already grown quite the fan base with his legion of Greek supporters in London making it feel like a home-away-from-home.</p>
      <p>“He’s great for tennis, because he has a very attractive game style, one-handed backhand, comes in a lot,” Thiem said.</p>
      <p>“It’s great that he’s up on the top. It’s great that he’s going to fight for the big titles in the future. I’m 100% sure of that.”</p>
      <p>It is the fourth year in a row that there is a first-time ATL Finals champion at the, after wins by Andy Murray in 2016, Gregor Dimitrov in 2017 and Alexander Zverev last year.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, French duo Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert won the doubles title by beating Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand 6-3 6-4.</p>
