        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> star Wes Nelson has become the latest to mock Molly-Mae Hague’s unseasoned chicken dinner and it’s literally too hot to handle.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/lily-allen-takes-swipe-love-islands-molly-mae-hagues-bland-chicken-dinner-presents-us-perfectly-made-roast-11077332/">Molly, 20, became the butt of jokes earlier this month</a> when she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/tommy-fury-defends-wifey-molly-mae-hague-fans-mock-bland-chicken-dinner-cooked-11046655/">cooked boyfriend </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tommy-fury/">Tommy Fury</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/tommy-fury-defends-wifey-molly-mae-hague-fans-mock-bland-chicken-dinner-cooked-11046655/"> a roast dinner with chicken</a> that fans described as ‘bland’ due to the lack of seasoning.</p>
      <p>Well, Wes found the perfect way to troll the couple’s unsavoury taste buds while showing off the spice rack in his new kitchen.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In an Instagram story on Sunday, the former Dancing On Ice star joked: ‘Here is the kitchen set up at the moment, some nice little bits that we got today.</p>
      <p>‘This in particular I imagine is Tommy and Molly’s worst nightmare,’ while swivelling the spice rack carousel around.</p>
      <p>We’re guessing the lovebirds won’t be accepting an invitation for Sunday dinner at Wes’ place.</p>
      <p>After the Molly’s dinner became meme of the week, Tommy defended his leading lady and explained: ‘Can I just say that the meal @mollymaehague made for me was a fighters meal clean cut food I don’t like seasoning or any of that btw.</p>

      <p>‘It was the most caring thing anyone has ever done for me so thanks for the meal babe I love you come on guys where’s the love [sic].’</p>
      <p>Wes, 21, gave fans a brief tour of the new apartment he has just moved into with girlfriend Arabella Chi, who coincidentally appeared in the same Love Island series with Tommy and Molly this summer.</p>
      <p>Celebrating the new chapter in their relationship, Arabella wrote on Instagram: ‘Packing completed. 8 years in this flat.</p>

      <p>‘Some good memories, some bad but beyond excited for this new chapter in our new home @wes.nelson.’</p>
      <p>The model later added: ‘We are in baby.’</p>
      <p>It makes sense that Wes and Arabella move into the same apartment as he admitted he had pretty much moved into her flat soon after they began dating in August.</p>

      <p>‘I haven’t left Arabella’s at since the first time I stayed over right at the start of our romance. There was never a set moment when we decided I’d move in, it just happened,’ he <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/wes-nelson-arabella-chi-house-20905258">told OK! Magazine.</a></p>
      <p>‘We’ve just got our own place together now but it doesn’t feel like a big jump as it’s what we’re already used to.’</p>
