        <b>The two men accusing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a> of sexual abuse could finally bring their lawsuits to trial due to a new change in the law.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wade Robson and James Safechuck are the two men who appeared in the Channel 4 documentary Leaving Neverland, accusing Jackson of sexual molestation when they were young boys.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t the first time they had made the claims as both Robson and Safechuck filed lawsuits against the late Thriller singer in 2013.</p>
      <p>However, a judge dismissed their cases in 2017 due to the statute of limitations.</p>
      <p>Although both men had appealed the court’s decision, their cases had been on hold in the appellate court until now.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/michael-jackson-accusers-wade-robson-james-safechuck-new-trials-appeal/">According to TMZ</a>, the California Court of Appeal have issued a tentative ruling that could overturn the original dismissals.</p>
      <p>This is because the California law has extended the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse cases since their cases were thrown out.</p>

      <p>An official decision is yet to be decided but oral arguments will take place this week.</p>

      <p>If a trial is granted, it would leave Robson and Safechuck room to sue the Michael Jackson Estate for millions like they did originally did six years ago.</p>
      <p>It was recently reported that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/21/michael-jacksons-estate-increases-profits-by-1-7billion-since-singers-death-10785571/">Jackson’s estate had seen an increase in profits by $1.7 billion (£1.3 billion)</a> since the singer’s death in 2009. Executors and lawyers have been able to rebuild Jackson’s assets after he left behind a staggering $500 million (£400 million) in debt at the time of his death.</p>
      <p>Jackson’s estate have vehemently denied the sexual abuse allegations against him.</p>

      <p>When <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/16/michael-jackson-estate-furious-farcical-leaving-neverland-wins-emmy-outstanding-documentary-10749725/">Leaving Neverland won a Creative Arts Emmy for outstanding documentary</a>, they hit back in a statement describing the film and the claims it makes as ‘complete fiction’.</p>
      <p>The estate said: ‘For a film that is a complete fiction to be honored in a nonfiction Emmy category is a complete farce.</p>
      <p>‘Not one shred of proof supports this completely one-sided, so-called documentary which was made in secrecy and for which not one person outside of the two subjects and their families were interviewed.’</p>
      <p>However, director Dan Reed applauded Robson and Safechuck for coming forward with their stories.</p>

      <p>The filmmaker told Entertainment Tonight: ‘We thought it would make some noise, but we kind of thought people would go, “Oh yeah, it’s another film about the allegations against Michael Jackson”. But this has been taking us completely unawares.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been a tsunami of love, of hatred, of attention and noise, of thoughtful critical reaction and unthinking reaction. It’s been a journey into the heart of the world media.’</p>
