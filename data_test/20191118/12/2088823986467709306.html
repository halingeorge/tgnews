      <p>We are Francophiles, and why not?</p>
      <p>The French love food. In fact, they love the entire eating experience. We've nailed the first part but need to work on the second.</p>
      <p>We found an opportunity at <a href="https://www.monamibuffalo.com/">Mon Ami Café &amp; Bakery</a>. Opened in March, Mon Ami occupies the former Globe Market space on Main Street.</p>
      <p>Fresh off our short NFTA Metro Rail ride we entered the bright, beautiful interior playing quiet, calm music. It was a balm to our work-weary souls.</p>
      <p>Mon Ami follows the trendy, efficient format of ordering at a counter with food delivered by a server. The menu is a mix of breakfast, brunch and lunch items perfectly pared down so there is no agonizing (well, maybe a little, but only because you’ll want everything).</p>
      <p>Greg Grigorian and Armen Pogosyan opened Mon Ami with a food philosophy based around the idea of incorporating French cuisine with an American/Buffalonian style. Hence the Buffalo quiche made with chicken, celery, hot sauce and blue cheese ($8.50).</p>

      <p>Breakfast is served all day and includes a nice variety from organic muesli ($6) with dried fruit to a Parisian eggs Benedict ($9.25) that pairs poached eggs, ham and bacon on a croissant with hollandaise. The Americain ($8.50) is the usual two eggs, bacon/sausage with bread or croissant, potatoes or cup of fruit. The Better With Gruyère is the same, with Gruyère cheese and eggs ($8.50). We would order the Salmon Morning, just to see the potato galette with Gruyère, salmon and a fried egg ($11.50).</p>
      <p>It wouldn’t be French without omelettes ($9.50) made your way from a list of ingredients. Or crêpes, which you can also make your own way ($8.50). The Crêpe Mon Ami ($6.50) comes with strawberries and vanilla ice cream.</p>
      <p>As much as we love breakfast, we went for lunch.</p>
      <p>Sandwiches come with chips. Add soup or a side salad for $2.50. Crêpes come with a side salad or cup of soup.</p>

      <p>A Chicken Parisien (10.50) used thick, perfectly toasted sourdough to enclose juicy balsamic chicken, crisp bacon, cheddar and tomatoes.</p>
      <p>The chicken crêpe ($8.50) wrapped a tender crêpe around a succulent chicken and mushroom cream filling. The simple vinaigrette dressed greens were the ideal complement to the rich dish.</p>
      <p>My croque madame ($9.75) – a fancy French grilled cheese – was heavenly. Grilled French bread came filled with ham, nutty melted Gruyère, béchamel sauce and Parmesan. Topped with a bright yellow fried egg, it was decadent and delicious. Its counterpart, a croque monsieur leaves off the egg ($9.50).</p>
      <p>The tomato-based house lentil soup was savory and flavorful. It defied what can sometimes be a blah soup. The French onion was a revelation. Not the harsh, salty concoctions often served, this soup was sweet from the onions. Delicate tasting, it arrived topped with a lovely baked cap of cheese. Tomato basil is the third house soup. Served with a slice of baguette, any soup would make a nice tidy lunch ($4.50 cup/$6 bowl).</p>

      <p>There is much to return for, like a roast beef French dip with ultra creamy garlicky-herby boursin cheese ($9.75) or the Salad Fermiere ($9) with Swiss cheese, apples, raisins, walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette (add chicken $2.50). For traditionalists, a simple quiche Lorraine of bacon, onion and cheese ($8); for millennials, a smoked salmon avocado toast ($12.50).</p>
      <p>Beverages include fresh-squeezed orange juice and French press coffee for two ($4.50).</p>
      <p>Admittedly, I started lunch with a single, darling crème brûlée cream puff ($1.25) from the pastry case. Light and crisp with a crackled brûléed top, the sweet, creamy filled confection was perfection.</p>
      <p>What would the French think of this faux pas? I bet they would applaud my decision.</p>
