      <p>A cryptic social media post from Sir Paul McCartney has prompted speculation among fans that he will perform at Glastonbury Festival next year.</p>
      <p>The ex-Beatle tweeted a picture featuring American composer and pianist Philip Glass, Hollywood star Emma Stone and musician Chuck Berry.</p>
      <p>Their surnames Glass, Stone and Berry, when said together, are similar to Glastonbury.</p>

      <p>Within minutes the tweet had been retweeted and liked several hundred times, with one fan commenting: “philip glass, sharon stone, chuck berry + glastonbury. i got it! x”</p>
      <p>Another wrote: “PAUL IS HEADLINING GLASTONBURY HOLY SHIT.”</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: “Ok now I need to somehow magically get a Glastonbury ticket.”</p>
      <p>Sir Paul, 77, is one of the top acts rumoured to be performing at next year’s 50th anniversary event.</p>
      <p>Talking about the possibility of taking to the stage at the world-renowned music event, he told Zoe Ball on her BBC Radio 2 breakfast show in September: “People are saying that it will be good if I did it, so I’m starting to think about whether I can or whether it would be a good thing.</p>
      <p>“My kids are saying ‘Dad, we’ve got to talk about Glastonbury’, and I think I know what they mean.”</p>
      <p>He last played the festival’s Pyramid Stage in 2004, delivering a set spanning his career from his time in the Fab Four to Wings and his solo material.</p>
      <p>Last month, Diana Ross was the first artist to be confirmed for Glastonbury 2020.</p>
      <p>The Motown star will play in the coveted Legends slot at the festival, which takes place from June 24-28.</p>
      <p>Tickets for Glastonbury Festival’s 50th anniversary sold out in just over half an hour when they went on sale in October.</p>
      <p>All 135,000 tickets for the 2020 event were bought within 34 minutes, according to organisers.</p>
