      <h2>From Tony Blackburn and Carol Thatcher to Stacey Solomon and Kerry Katona, here's what happened next for the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here winners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:54:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Frances Kindon</a></address>
      <p>The celebrities are on their way Down Under and ready to brave spiders, snakes and starvation to see who will be crowned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here</a>'s king or queen of the jungle.</p>
      <p>This year will see the likes of Girls Aloud's Nadine Coyle and Olympian Caitlyn Jenner battle it out for the coveted accolade and a career injection.</p>
      <p>But what became of the stars who went before them? I'm A Celeb is often touted as being the best reality deal a star can land, but it doesn't always guarantee success.</p>
      <p>From bankruptcies and scandals to tragedy and divorce, here's what came next for the winners...</p>
      <h3>Tony Blackburn (Series 1: 2002)</h3>

      <p>Radio DJ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blackburn">Tony Blackburn</a> was the winner of the first ever I’m A Celeb back in 2002.</p>
      <p>After leaving the jungle he continued to work for the BBC but was abruptly sacked after the Dame Janet Smith Review report linked him to the investigation into the Jimmy Savile scandal.</p>
      <p>Blackburn insisted he was innocent of any wrongdoing and said he was “devastated” by the sacking.</p>
      <p>He was reinstated on October 19, 2016 after he threatened to sue.</p>
      <p>That same year he underwent prostate surgery after waking up in extreme pain but was found not to have cancer.</p>
      <h3>Phil Tufnell (Series 2: 2003)</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Fresh from retirement, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/phil-tufnell">England cricketer Phil</a> Tufnell was crowned King of the Jungle in 2003.</p>
      <p>He went on to do the reality rounds, starring in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> in 2009 and The Jump in 2015.</p>
      <p>He's also popped up on game shows including The Chase, and was a team captain on A Question of Sport between 2005 and 2015.</p>
      <p>Last year, he joined Australia's Seven Network as a commentator for the BBL and Sri Lankan Test matches.</p>
      <h3>Kerry Katona (Series 3: 2004)</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Atomic Kitten’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kerry-katona">Kerry</a> became the first female winner in 2004 just months after Brian McFadden left her for Delta Goodrem.</p>
      <p>Since then she's continued to hit the headlines thanks to her terrible boyfriend choices and divorces.</p>
      <p>She was crowned Celebrity Mum of the Year in 2005 and landed an advertising deal with Iceland but ended up hooked on cocaine and going to rehab where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
      <p>On Valentine's Day 2007 she married taxi driver Mark Croft in Gretna Green and their daughter Heidi was born six days later. Son Max followed in 2008, the same year she was made bankrupt for failing to pay the final £87,000 of a £417,000 tax bill.</p>
      <p>Her marriage fell apart when Kerry's mum accused him of being a drug dealer.</p>

        <figcaption>Mark Croft and Kerry Katona (Image: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He denied those claims but did admit he'd enjoyed spending a good chunk of her £6million fortune on flash cars, including a £135,000 Ferrari he rejected because it was too wide for Sainsbury's car park.</p>
      <p>Their divorce was finalised in 2011 and she started dating former rugby league player George Kay.</p>
      <p>Kerry almost died giving birth to their daughter Dylan-Jorge in April 2014 and later said the trauma set George on a toxic downwards spiral.</p>

        <figcaption>George Kay died in July (Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>They married in September 2014 before splitting the following October when she filed assault charges against the sports star, who served three and a half years for blackmail in 2004.</p>
      <p>They reunited in 2015 and tried to make a go of things, but the final straw came when George suffered another public meltdown in July 2017.</p>
      <p>Their split turned even more sour when George allegedly made threats against Kerry and her mum Sue after an irate video call with Dylan.</p>
      <p>George died on July 6 2019 after suffering a suspected overdose.</p>
      <h3>Joe Pasquale (Series 4: 2004)</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Comedian <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-pasquale">Joe</a> left the jungle with the crown on his head in series four, which was the second series of the year.</p>
      <p>His win briefly revived his career and earned him an ITV special titled An Audience with Joe Pasquale in 2005.</p>
      <p>He still makes the occasional TV appearance and was guest host on The Paul O’Grady Show in 2009 and The Nightly Show in 2017.</p>
      <h3>Carol Thatcher (Series 5: 2005)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4547959.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Carol-Thatcher-2005.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Carol Thatcher was the second female winner of I'm A Celeb (Image: Daily Mirror)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/carol-thatcher">Journalist Carol</a> managed to emerge from the shadow of her mother, the late Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to win I’m A Celeb 2005.</p>
      <p>Her victory propelled her into a correspondent role for the BBC's One Show, which lasted until 2009 when the broadcaster dropped her after she was apparently heard calling a black cricket player a "golliwog" in the green room.</p>
      <p>She refused to apologise, telling the Guardian: "I stand by what I said. I wasn't going to apologise. I never meant it in a racist way. It was shorthand. I described someone's appearance colloquially – someone I happen to greatly admire."</p>
      <h3>Matt Willis (Series 6: 2006)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4547975.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Matt-Willis-2006.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>With Busted two years in the past, Matt hoped a jungle stint could help his solo career and ended up leaving with the crown.</p>
      <p>He went on to enjoy huge success in Busted and McFly mash-up band, McBusted, before Busted themselves reformed to critical acclaim.</p>
      <p>He and his then-girlfriend Emma Griffiths co-hosted the ITV spin off from 2006 until 2008 before tying the knot and welcoming children Isabelle, 10, Ace, seven, and Trixie, three.</p>
      <h3>Christopher Biggins (Series 7: 2007)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18920783.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GP10001463.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Veteran actor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christopher-biggins">Christopher Biggins</a> took the I’m A Celeb crown in 2007 and enjoyed something of a career renaissance.</p>
      <p>However, that stalled after a disastrous appearance on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity Big Brother</a> in 2016 where he upset viewers by making <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/christopher-biggins-claims-bisexuals-blame-8577819">derogatory remarks about bisexuals</a> - and was booted from the house amid accusations of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/christopher-biggins-disgusting-anti-semitic-8578024">anti semitic comments</a>.</p>
      <p>He insisted he wasn't a bigot and apologised, telling The Sun: “I am mortified by what’s happened, really mortified. Most of my friends, in fact, are Jewish. I apologised to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> and [housemate] Katie [Waissel].”</p>
      <h3>Joe Swash (Series 8: 2008)</h3>

      <p>EastEnders star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-swash">Joe Swash</a> jungled his way to glory in 2008 having been written out of the BBC One soap earlier that year.</p>
      <p>From 2009 he hosted the spin-off, I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here NOW! before it was renamed Extra Camp in 2016.</p>
      <p>In June 2007, his then-fiancee Emma Sophocleous, gave birth to their first child, son Harry Swash, but they split just seven months later.</p>
      <p>In November 2009 he was declared bankrupt - although his agent Becca Barr insisted it was simply a mix-up and that he wasn't in financial difficulty.</p>
      <p>The year after he met <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> star Stacey Solomon when she won the show, and in 2016 they confirmed they were an item.</p>
      <p>Their son Rex was born in May.</p>

      <p>Smooth-talking <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gino-dacampo">Celebrity chef Gino</a> charmed his way to the final in 2009.</p>
      <p>But after leaving the jungle, he and co-star, Hollyoaks actor Stuart Manning, were charged with animal cruelty for killing and cooking a rat while in exile.</p>
      <p>However, the charges were dropped after ITV producers took responsibility and coughed up a £3,000 fine.</p>
      <p>He has since been a regular chef on ITV's This Morning and a team captain on Celebrity Juice since 2014.</p>
      <p>Gino has also fronted his own TV shows including Gino’s Italian Escape and There’s No Taste Like Home - and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/phillip-schofield-enjoys-rare-night-11310208">opened a new flagship restaurant</a> in London.</p>

      <p>Best known for playing Janine Butcher on the BBC soap before her stint in the jungle, Charlie continued to play the character until 2014.</p>
      <p>She has appeared in a couple of other TV shows including Suspects and featured on stage in plays - and has also <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ex-eastenders-star-charlie-brooks-7248715">gathered a following due to her fitness achievements.</a></p>

      <p>Since winning the show, Foggy has been something of a match maker - setting up fellow contestant and X Factor star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-jake-quickenden-former-x-11806286">Jake Quickenden</a> with his own daughter, Danielle.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vicky-pattison">Vicky Pattison</a> seemingly hoped I’m A Celeb would elevate her fledgling career after quitting Geordie Shore.</p>
      <p>She reinvented herself as a fitness guru and was hired to present spin-off show Extra Camp in 2016 before being swiftly replaced by Scarlett Moffatt after just one season.</p>
      <p>In 2018 she starred in the Aussie version of the show and partnered with Dom Joly on Celebrity Haunted, and this year saw her take part in Celebrity Coach Trip.</p>

      <p>Her win brought her to the attention of hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, who took their fellow Geordie under their wings.</p>

      <p>She beat Iain Lee and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/jamie-lomas-im-a-celebrity-11506455">Jamie Lomas</a> to the title and couldn't have been more shocked. She's also starred in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/celebs-go-dating-line-up-10921349">Celebs Go Dating</a> and landed herself a presenting slot on This Morning.</p>

      <p>Football manager Harry had never watched I'm a Celeb before and had no idea what was involved but decided to sign up anyway.</p>
      <p>From the get go he was a favourite among his fellow campmates and viewers at home, with everyone instantly warming to his down to earth nature and humour.</p>
      <p>He talked frequently about his wife of 54 years, Sandra, and their blissfully happy relationship they'd began when they were just 17.</p>
