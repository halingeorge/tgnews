      <h1>Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit makes Microsoft Xbox Adaptive Controller even better for disabled gamers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:58:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://betanews.com/author/brianfagioli/" target="_blank">Brian Fagioli</a></address>
      <p>For most people, playing a video game is as easy as picking up a controller. Unfortunately, there are some folks out there that cannot hold a typical gamepad due to disability. For a long time, people with disabilities were forced to either not play video games or struggle with what was available.</p>
      <p>These days, however, the gaming market is more thoughtful regarding the less-able. A great example of this is Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller -- a special device designed to make gaming a reality for disabled people. Today, Logitech G is taking things further with its Adaptive Gaming Kit -- a brilliant add-on to Microsoft's offering. For this new product, Logitech even consulted with AbleGamers -- a charity focused on inclusion in gaming.</p>
      <p>"Compatible with the Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC), the Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit lets gamers play the way that’s most suitable for them by providing a set of controls that are easily configured to a wide variety of use cases. It features a large assortment of buttons and triggers with gaming-grade components for performance and durability, manufactured to the highest standard, at a price point that is far more accessible than what is on the market today," says Logitech.</p>
      <p>The company further says, "The Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit includes three small buttons and three large buttons that feature gaming-grade mechanical switches. It also includes four light touch buttons, two variable trigger controls, configurable game mats with a hook and loop system, and custom labels and velcro ties."</p>

      <p>Steve Spohn, chief operations officer, AbleGamers, provides the following statement.</p>
      <blockquote>The goal of AbleGamers is to find a way for people with varying abilities to play video games. Everyone's needs are different, and the Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit delivers a wide range of configuration options to make gaming a possibility for all. We appreciated the opportunity to work closely with Logitech G on the design of this kit and look forward to continuing our partnership in the future.</blockquote>
      <p>The Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit can be had <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gamepads/adaptive-gaming-kit-accessories.html">here</a> now for $99.99. If you know a disabled gamer, this would make a really cool Christmas gift. Keep in mind, however, you will also need the Microsoft Xbox Adaptive Controller. It also costs $99.99 and can be purchased <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-adaptive-controller/8nsdbhz1n3d8">here</a>.</p>
