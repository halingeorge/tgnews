        <b>Lydia Hart (Karen Blick) has been through a lot over the past couple of months in Emmerdale, but she’s set for more heartache and devastation in tonight’s episode when she not only comes face-to-face with her long-lost mum Agatha, but she also learns some heart-breaking news.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After all the torment she’s caused Lydia, Mandy (Lisa Riley) is determined to make amends tonight, and thus she sets out to speak to Lydia’s sister, Beth, once more.</p>
      <p>However, as Mandy arrives at Beth’s place, she comes face-to-face Agatha —aka Lydia’s mum. Mandy’s confused, as she believed Agatha to be dead — as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/emmerdale-spoilers-lydia-hart-discovers-her-mum-is-dead-but-its-a-lie-11056773/">did Lydia for that matter.</a></p>
      <p>Agatha asks Mandy to take her to see Lydia and, after some persuasion, Mandy agrees to do so. Later, they arrive at the Dingles’ home — and Lydia is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/emmerdale-spoilers-lydia-harts-mum-back-from-the-dead-in-shock-twist-10971733/">shocked when she sets her sights upon her mum</a>.</p>

      <p>Agatha attempts to reacquaint herself with her daughter, and admits that she’s got a bit of explaining too.</p>
      <p>However, if having to cope with the stress of the situation at hand wasn’t hard enough for Lydia to deal with, she soon realises an upsetting fact. Yes, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/emmerdale-spoilers-devastating-illness-storyline-for-lydia-hart-10971861/">her dad died as a result of Huntington’s disease</a> — and there’s a likely chance that Lydia could have the same thing.</p>
      <p>How will Lydia react to receiving the news?</p>
      <p>Will her and Agatha get along?</p>
