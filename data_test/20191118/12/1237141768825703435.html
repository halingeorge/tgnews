      <p>Wrist-based heart rate monitors are certainly less cumbersome than those with a chest strap. But they’re also less accurate, especially as you run faster, and some models can be off by several beats per minute, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6732081/">according to new research</a>.</p>
      <p>For a study published in Cardi<i>ovascular Diagnosis &amp; Therapy</i>, researchers at the Cleveland Clinic had 50 adults (34 men, 16 women) run on a treadmill at an increasing pace. The runners started at 4 miles per hour, and sped up by 1 mile per hour every 2 minutes until a final 2-minute bout at 9 miles per hour (6:40 per mile pace).</p>
      <p>The runners wore an electrocardiogram (ECG), which is considered the most accurate way to measure heart rate, and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Polar-H7-Transmitter-Strap-Med/dp/B0716L31YC/">Polar H7 chest strap heart monitor</a>. In randomized order, the runners also wore two wrist-based heart monitors (one on each wrist) from among these four commercially available models: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-3&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fnews%2Fa29801627%2Fhow-accurate-is-your-wrist-heart-rate-monitor%2F">Apple Watch III</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fshop%2Fionic&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fnews%2Fa29801627%2Fhow-accurate-is-your-wrist-heart-rate-monitor%2F">Fitbit Ionic</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F531166&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fnews%2Fa29801627%2Fhow-accurate-is-your-wrist-heart-rate-monitor%2F">Garmin Vivosmart HR</a>, and TomTom Spark 3.</p>
      <p>The researchers compared the heart rate readings given by the wrist monitors and Polar chest strap to those given by the ECG. The key finding: As the runners went faster, the wrist monitors became less accurate. At rest, the difference between the commercially available monitors and the ECG were small enough to be considered insignificant.</p>
      <p>At all paces, the readings from the chest strap most closely matched those from the ECG. None of the wrist monitors were as accurate as the chest strap; at 8 mph (7:30 mile pace) and 9 mph, the difference between the wrist monitor and ECG readings increased.</p>
      <p>The Apple monitor was the most accurate of the wrist devices at all paces. For example, at 9 mph, the Apple monitor was off by 1.5 beats per minute, compared to almost 3 beats per minute for the Garmin. Adding to the potential uncertainty: On average at any speed, the Garmin used in this study underestimated heart rate by of 2 beats per minute, while the TomTom monitor overestimated heart rate by 6 beats per minute.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709155">A 2017 study</a> by the Cleveland Clinic team found an earlier version of the Apple Watch to be more accurate than contemporary Fitbit, Garmin and TomTom models up to 10 minute per mile pace. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4974868/">Research published in 2016</a> also found the Apple watch to be more accurate than several other wrist-worn devices.</p>
      <p>Wrist-based heart monitors likely become more inaccurate at higher intensities because of greater arm action, <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/6670-milind-desai">Milind Desai, M.D.</a>, one of the Cleveland Clinic researchers, told <i>Runner’s World</i>.</p>
      <p>To what extent do these findings matter? On most runs, probably not much. But when you’re doing your hardest workouts and aiming for a heart rate in a quite narrow range, precision becomes more important. If your wrist device already under- or overestimates your heart rate, and then you add more inaccuracy at faster speeds, you might well be running too fast or too slow.</p>
      <p>For example, to get the optimal benefits from a <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a26066029/increase-vo2-max/">VO<sub>2 </sub>max workout</a>, you might do 800-meter repeats at 93 to 95 percent of your maximum heart rate. If your max heart rate is 180, you would aim to sustain a heart rate between 167 and 171 for most of your repeats. If your wrist monitor is off by only 5 beats per minute in either direction, you wouldn’t get the full intended benefits from that workout.</p>
      <p>If that level of precision is important to you, consider using a chest-strap monitor on your fastest workouts. American record holder and two-time Olympian <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/author/221616/molly-huddle/">Molly Huddle</a> usually relies on a wrist monitor, but wears a chest strap for <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20630818/hill-running-workouts-for-speed/">hill repeats</a> and short track intervals.</p>

      <p>If you don’t want to wear a chest strap, Desai advises setting a goal range within a 5-beats-per-minute window to account for potential wrist monitor inaccuracy. Also, Desai says, make sure your wrist monitor fits comfortably but snugly to minimize its movement when you pick up the pace.</p>
