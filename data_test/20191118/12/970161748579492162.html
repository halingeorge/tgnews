      <h1>Prince Andrew 'used N-word in meeting with Downing Street advisor'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> has been accused of using the n-word during a discussion about trade policy.</p>
      <p>Former Downing Street advisor Rohan Silva said he had a meeting with the Duke of York when he asked if the government department responsible for trade ‘could be doing a better job’.</p>
      <p>He claims the Queen’s second son replied: ‘Well, If you’ll pardon the expression, that really is the n***** in the woodpile.’</p>
      <p>Mr Silva, 38, who is of Sri Lankan descent, said he ‘walked blinking into the sunshine outside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/buckingham-palace/">Buckingham Palace</a>, reeling at the prince’s use of language’.</p>
      <p>Palace sources insisted to the paper that Prince Andrew would never use such language and categorically denied the incident took place.</p>

      <p>However, Mr Silva told the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/prince-andrew-caught-in-nword-row-former-downing-street-aide-rohan-silva-accuses-duke-of-york-of-a4289516.html">Evening Standard</a>: ‘For a long time afterwards I kicked myself for not confronting the prince on his choice of words – and it’s something I still regret today. After all, he clearly wasn’t taken to task very often by the people around him, which meant offensive language went unchallenged.’</p>
      <p>He also claimed that at a meeting with him the previous year discussing EU reform, Prince Andrew had used the phrase: ‘What you have got to remember is that you’ll never get anywhere by playing the white man.’</p>
      <p>At first he did not know what was meant by the phrase, but googled it and found it was ‘used during colonial times, meaning that only white people can be trusted to follow the rules, unlike dark-skinned natives’.</p>

      <p>The phrase ‘n***** in the woodpile’ dates back to the American Deep South in the 19th century, when it referred to fugitive slaves hiding in piles of wood to go north to Canada.</p>

      <p>It was used by Anne Marie Morris, Tory MP for Newton Abbott, when talking to a group of Eurosceptics about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.</p>
      <p>She was suspended from the Tory whip, but let back into the party after she apologised for the ‘inappropriate and offensive language’ which she claimed was a ‘mistake’.</p>

      <p>The latest claims about Prince Andrew follow a ‘disastrous’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/">interview with Emily Maitlis on Newsnight</a>, during which he claimed he could not have had sex with underage Virginia Giuffre because he had eaten at Pizza Express that day.</p>
      <p>He said it was wrong to have stayed with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and that he ‘let the side down’, but claims he had no idea ‘what was going on’.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre said she was trafficked when she was 17 and was forced into sexual encounters with the Duke in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.</p>
      <p>The prince said he had ‘no recollection’ of ever meeting her.</p>
