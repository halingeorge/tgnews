      <h1>Mateusz Klich responds when asked if he will retire at end of his Leeds deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:45:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.polsatsport.pl/wiadomosc/2019-11-15/klich-nie-jestem-specjalnie-zadowolony-z-tego-jak-gralem-w-kadrze/">Mateusz Klich has told Polish outlet Polsat Sport</a> that he is determined to continue his career even when his new Leeds United contract expires in the summer of 2024.</p>
      <p>Klich, 29, has put pen to paper on a deal that will him remain at Elland Road for the remainder of this season and the next four seasons after that. The length of the deal is slightly surprising, given that he turns 30 next June.</p>
      <p>However, fitness is not an issue for the 23-time Poland international. Last season, Klich clocked up an enormous 50 appearances for Leeds as well as playing eight times for his country. This season, Klich has started 17 of Leeds’ 18 games.</p>
      <p>The former Wolfsburg and FC Twente midfielder was asked if he would retire at the end of his new deal – when he is 34 years of age – but Klich has stated that he has no intention of ending his career that early.</p>
      <p>“I will definitely not finish my career at the age of 34. I can say that no,” <a href="https://www.polsatsport.pl/wiadomosc/2019-11-15/klich-nie-jestem-specjalnie-zadowolony-z-tego-jak-gralem-w-kadrze/">Klich said.</a> “It is known that by signing such a long contract at my age I gained a lot of peace.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Was it right to offer Klich such a long-term deal?</h3>
      <p>It is a strange one. Normally at about the age of 32, Klich will begin to lose a yard of pace and his value will depreciate. But it also suggests how important Marcelo Bielsa sees the midfielder.</p>
      <p>Whether Klich will remain at Leeds for the entirety of his new contract remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain – he will is pivotal to Bielsa’s side and the Whites will not let the midfielder leave anytime soon; especially while Bielsa is in charge.</p>
