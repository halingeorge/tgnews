      <h1>Cricket Australia suspends Emily Smith for unintentionally sharing team’s line-up</h1>
      <h2>Emily Smith on November 2 had shared the Hobart Hurricanes' line-up for their clash against Sydney Thunder on her Instagram account, which was in violation of Cricket Australia's Anti-Corruption Code.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:59:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>Hobart Hurricanes wicketkeeper Emily Smith was handed a one-year suspension by Cricket Australia for sharing Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) team’s line-up on social media an hour before its scheduled release.</p>
      <p>Due to the suspension, the 24-year-old cricketer will now no longer take part in the remainder of the WBBL season and the upcoming 50-over women’s national cricket league.</p>
      <p>Smith on November 2 had shared the Hurricanes’ line-up for their clash against Sydney Thunder on her Instagram account. However, the match was later called off without a single delivery being bowled due to heavy downpour in Burnie.</p>
      <p>Article 2.3.2 of the code prohibits: “Disclosing inside information to any person (with or without reward) where the participant knew or might reasonably have known that such disclosure might lead to the information being used in relation to betting in relation to any match or event.”</p>
      <p>Cricket Australia released a statement in this regard and stated that as per its anti-corruption code it prohibits players from sharing insider information that can be used for betting. However, the board mentioned that the information was leaked unintentionally but no excuses will be entertained for such mistakes.</p>
      <p>“Since the commencement of the WBBL, Cricket Australia has had in place a robust anti-corruption program,” said Sean Carroll, Cricket Australia’s head of integrity and security.</p>
      <p>“We have been working with Emily throughout the process and Emily now understands the mistake she made.”</p>
      <p>After the infamous ball-tampering episode involving former Aussie skipper <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/steve-smith/">Steve Smith</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/david-warner/">David Warner</a> and Cameron Bancroft, Cricket Australia has been more stringent about player’s discipline, both on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>A day ago, the cricket body banned James Pattinson from taking part in the first Test between Australia and Pakistan. He was banned for personal abuse of an opponent while playing for Victoria in a Sheffield Shield match.</p>
