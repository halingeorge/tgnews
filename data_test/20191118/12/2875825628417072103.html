      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor</a> took some time out of training for his UFC return to hit pads with his son Conor junior last week.</p>

      <p>This footage was shared on the Irishman’s Instagram feed yesterday, where it has been viewed more than a million times.</p>
      <p>Accompanying the clip, the fighter wrote: “We reap what we sow," which fans saying the same thing about McGregor’s young son, with one calling him a "future champ champ."</p>
