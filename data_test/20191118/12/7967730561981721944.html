      <h1>Trainers converge on mid-north coast meeting after fire drama</h1>

      <p>It's been a while since Taree has had so many stables converging for one meeting on a Tuesday.</p>
      <p>On top of initial healthy nominations, many runners have rebooted from last Thursday's postponed meeting at Port Macquarie, and the result is a bumper nine-race card with winning chances coming left, right and centre.</p>
      <p>Leading the charge is a mare who the Kris Lees stable in Newcastle hopes can discard the tag of being one of the better maidens in non-metropolitan NSW.</p>

      <p>Alam Mo Na, by High Chaparral out of high-class sprinter Queen Of The Hill is a hot favourite to finally break through over 2100m after three impressive closing runs against stronger this prep.</p>
      <p>Another of the more scrutinised runners will be supremely bred former Kiwi Genghis Khan, who makes his Australian debut as a gelding in a maiden over 1614m for the Jason Deamer stable.</p>
      <p>A son of Irish stallion and multiple group 1 champion Cape Blanco, who was trained by Aiden O'Brien, Genghis Khan hasn't started since failing in the heavy at Avondale in the winter, but his work has reportedly been strong since setting up camp in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>This striking chestnut will get a stern test today from filly Bear The Crown, who has shown quick improvement in only two runs for the "King of Kempsey" Barry Ratcliff.</p>
      <p>The Deamer stable is on a high after the brave third of Bon Amis in the inaugural $1million The Hunter on Saturday and confidence is high again today.</p>
      <p>Improving mare Constanzia is a real chance third-up in a class 1 over 1312m before the excitement goes to another level when promising mare The Deel Is Dun tackles a benchmark 58 heat of The Rising Star over 1412m.</p>
      <p>By the great Kiwi and six time group 1 winner Dundeel, The Deel Is Dun has already proven to be a second-up performer, and last time on this track landed a betting plunge when charging home from a mile back to win a benchmark 58 under Sammie Clenton, who is on board again today.</p>
      <p>Another trainer full of confidence is Wyong-based Kristen Buchanan, who saddles up Hubble second-up before unleashing her smart three-year-old Upper East Side, who looks well placed to make it three wins from his last four in a benchmark 66 over 1007m to close the meeting.</p>
