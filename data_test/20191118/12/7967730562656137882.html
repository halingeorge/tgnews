      <h1>What would I know about hellfire? I'm just a koala</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:40:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Warwick McFadyen</a></address>
      <p>My name is not important, but I bring testimony. I am a koala of the area you humans know as the NSW Mid North Coast. I ask you, what have I done, what have my mother and father, relatives and friends done to deserve this? My fur is singed. It gives off the lingering stench of fire. There is smoke through my skin, dust coats my frame. I have not had moisture for days. My food is ash. I am lucky, picked out from the debris; many others did not survive. Why did this happen to me? Why us?</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53bim.html">One of you says the fire is a judgment from God.</a> He, Israel Folau, says this land is full of a wickedness that goes against his truths. The droughts, the fires, they are the spears of his power that strike at the heart of darkness. Now, I am fearful of locusts. Though perhaps locusts should also be fearful. The wrath of his God is indiscriminate. It is random, and thus being so, strikes at all creatures, great and small. It is not just fires, but actions of men and women, all must be razed to ground zero, smouldering, scorched, until the one true way to his ideal is met.</p>
      <p>I carry his words like a chain around my emaciated neck. The dead carry his words on their bones.</p>
      <p>‘‘I’ve been looking around at the events that’s been happening in Australia, this past couple of weeks, with all the natural disasters, the bushfires and the droughts.’’</p>
      <p>‘‘God is speaking to you guys. Australia you need to repent and take these laws and turn it back to what is right.’’</p>

      <p>‘‘The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell in it are desolate. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.”</p>
      <p>“Repent and the lord will heal you, forgive your sins and heal your land - that is the solution to what is happening right now in this nation.”</p>
      <p>But I am not human. And yet am I not also an inhabitant of this earth? If the sinners must be punished by the divine lights of this God, must all be punished? It makes no sense to me. This is not love. This is hate. But I am just a koala. I cannot judge. I cannot repent.</p>
