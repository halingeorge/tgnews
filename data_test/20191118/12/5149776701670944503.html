      <p>A series of Pilgrim-inspired events will take place across Nottinghamshire to help mark 400 years since people from the county sailed to America and helped form the nation.</p>
      <p>Events which are planned include a Thanksgiving meal at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">schools</a>, a Pilgrim-themed survival challenge, festivals celebrating local heritage, and community plays based on the Pilgrim story.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims' journey to the famous Mayflower ship can be traced from Yorkshire and then through north Nottinghamshire, taking in villages including Scrooby and Babworth, before continuing through the Midlands to their end destination.</p>
      <p>They made their voyage in 1620 to flee religious persecution from King James and eventually set up a colony in Plymouth, Massachusetts.</p>

      <p>“These 400th anniversary plans present a fantastic opportunity to show the rest of the country and the world what we have to offer to boost the county’s tourism credentials.</p>
      <p>“These events will hopefully inspire more people to learn more about this extraordinary journey where people travelled across the world set up a new colony and establish principles for the foundation of freedom and modern democracy, led by William Brewster from Scrooby.”</p>
      <p>The plans to celebrate the anniversary of the Pilgrims’ voyage were given the green light by county councillors at Nottinghamshire County Council’s policy committee on November 13.</p>
