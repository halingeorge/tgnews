      <p>A call by Malaysia’s National Film Development Corporation (Finas) CEO Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri to regulate Netflix and censor sex scenes has become an idea for a ‘skip sex’ button.</p>
      <p>At first, the Finas CEO said parents are worried because their children watch uncensored movies and TV shows on Netflix.</p>
      <p>Later he explained that <a href="https://www.thesundaily.my/local/ahmad-idham-clarifies-netflix-censorship-issue-YA1615760">he was taking cognisance</a> of concerns by parents in the cyber era about uncensored content.</p>
      <p>“What I proposed was for some form of collaboration between Finas and the National Council of Women’s Organisations to hold a forum or seminar to debate this issue in the context of strengthening digital content in the future,” he said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>In March this year, Kuala Kangsar MP Mastura Mohd Yazid raised a concern about sex scenes and LGBT representation on Netflix.</p>
      <p>“This is about films on Netflix. Are there different mechanisms between those normally used to censor films and those on Netflix?</p>
      <p>“Because I am seeing widespread sex scenes and LGBT elements which are causing worry among the people,” she told the Malaysian Parliament.</p>
      <p>But social media users in Malaysia are running wild about a ‘skip sex button’ Netflix is supposedly introducing soon for Malaysian subscribers.<br/>An article on ‘skip Sex’ button <a href="http://thetapirtimes.com/2019/11/17/backing-finas-netflix-launches-skip-sex-button/">Tapir Times</a> (a satirical website) went viral.<br/>It says Netflix revealed plans to introduce a ‘skip sex’ button for Malaysian adults who cannot wait for government censorship of the content they are paying for.<br/>The ‘Skip Sex’ button is supposed to work just like the ‘Skip Intro’ button and is supposed to appear on the lower-left corner of the screen.</p>
      <p>In October, Netflix which has 158 million paid subscribers in 190 countries announced the launch of a <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/malaysians-can-now-enjoy-netflix-starting-rm17-month">mobile plan</a> for Malaysia with a monthly fee starting from RM17.</p>

        <b>“Skip Politics’ Button</b>
      </p>
      <p>Netflix has a new ‘Skip Politics’ button though. It appears on Seth Meyers’ new stand-up hour which gives viewers the option to fast forward through his jokes about the US President, Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>It sounded like a joke when Mr Meyers talked about the skip button, but then the button appeared when he started to talk about Trump.</p>
      <p>Click on it and it fast-forwards the show by around eight minutes to a point where he’s back to talking about other stuff. -/TISG</p>
