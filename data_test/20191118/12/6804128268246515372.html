      <h1>The Liverpool suspension risk against Crystal Palace to hand Jurgen Klopp a selection headache</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool midfielder has been a revelation this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:03:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:03</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool midfielder Fabinho is walking a suspension tightrope ahead of the Crystal Palace clash on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian international was booked in the 1-1 draw against Manchester United in October to pick up his fourth yellow card of the season, and has remained on that tally since.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old is now just one booking away from a one-match suspension, ahead of the return of Premier League football after the international break, when Jurgen Klopp's side travel to Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Any player who earns five bookings from his side's first 19 Premier League matches of the season will have to serve a one-match ban.</p>
      <p>If Fabinho is cautioned against Palace, he would then be banned for Liverpool's next Premier League fixture against Brighton at home.</p>
      <p>This season, Fabinho has established himself as one of the best players in Europe in his position with his displays at the heart of midfield.</p>
      <p>With the threat of suspension hanging over the former Monaco star, Klopp previously rested the midfielder against Aston Villa to avoid losing him for the clash against Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The decision paid off with Fabinho impressing against Pep Guardiola's side and opening the scoring in the first half.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Klopp will make the same tactical decision again, with Palace away arguably a more stubborn test than the visit of Brighton to Anfield next weekend.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool boss previously discussed the importance of the midfielder to his set-up after a win against Genk in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>“The Genk game was a good example for that - [he was] very important, very important. It was clear it will not be perfectly tuned with Ox and Naby around because they didn’t play a lot together in this formation, but it’s a possible formation for sure,” the boss said.</p>
      <p>“Fabi had a lot to do to sort some little gaps which we left open in different situations. So yes, the job of the No.6 in modern football is incredibly important and the more offensive players there are around you, the more important it gets. But he’s not only a gap-closer, a challenger or whatever, he is a very good footballer as well.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure that the next player we sign, when he is not playing at any time, not playing from the first minute, then we will have the same conversations when you ask me ‘what about him, why is he not playing, does he need time?’ and all that stuff. Then maybe I remind you that Fabinho needed time.</p>
      <p>“That a player doesn’t see it like this I can 100 per cent understand, and that outside everybody’s excited and doesn’t want it [to be like this] I can understand but it is still like this, you cannot change it. You know in the beginning I thought we had to change the system to a ‘double six’ midfield that he was used to at Monaco.</p>
      <p>“In that game [against Genk] he played pretty much as the only midfielder in some moments! He just needed time. It was his birthday [on Wednesday] and what is he? Twenty-six? So that’s 10 more proper years at least so there’s a lot to come and he can improve a lot as well, and that’s all good.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very interesting period for him and for us and so far he did really well.”</p>
