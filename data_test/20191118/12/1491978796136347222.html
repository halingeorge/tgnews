      <h1>Prince Andrew used the N-word, former No 10 aide claims</h1>

        <i>Rohan Silva says royal used word in 2012 conversation at Buckingham Palace</i>
      </p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has been accused of using the N-word in a conversation with a senior political aide, adding to the royal’s woes after his BBC Newsnight <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/17/prince-andrew-calls-for-royal-to-say-sorry-and-speak-to-fbi">interview regarding his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>The claim was made by Rohan Silva, a former aide to David Cameron, who met the prince at Buckingham Palace in 2012.</p>
      <p>Silva asked the Queen’s son whether the government department responsible for trade “could be doing a better job”, according to <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/prince-andrew-caught-in-nword-row-former-downing-street-aide-rohan-silva-accuses-duke-of-york-of-a4289516.html">the Evening Standard</a>.</p>
      <p>He claims the prince responded: “Well, if you’ll pardon the expression, that really is the [N-word] in the woodpile.”</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace sources have categorically denied the claim.</p>
      <p>The same phrase was used by Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris in 2017, prompting the party to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/12/tories-restore-whip-to-mp-suspended-for-using-racist-language-anne-marie-morris">suspend her for several months</a>.</p>
      <p>The Evening Standard quoted unnamed palace sources insisting Andrew never made the comment and would never use such language.</p>
      <p>However, Silva, who is from a Sri Lankan background, said he “walked blinking into the sunshine outside Buckingham Palace, reeling at the prince’s use of language” after the meeting.</p>
      <p>“For a long time afterwards I kicked myself for not confronting the prince on his choice of words – and it’s something I still regret today. He clearly wasn’t taken to task very often by the people around him, which meant offensive language could go unchallenged.”</p>
      <p>Silva said the private meeting was attended by him, the prince and a royal aide, making it harder to independently verify the claim.</p>
      <p>The phrase originated in the early 19th-century US, relating to slaves attempting to hide in piles of wood while fleeing, later becoming a phrase used to mean an “unknown factor affecting a situation in an adverse way”.</p>
      <p>The Atlantic, an American magazine, has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/anne-marie-morris-suspended/533220/">previously quoted</a> a linguistics professor saying: “The phrase was used by middle-class speakers in conversation in the UK the 1950s and 60s,” aided by its usage in works by Agatha Christie, Somerset Maugham and Dr Seuss.</p>
      <p>Andrew <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/21/prince-andrew-trade-envoy-palace">previously worked</a> as a trade envoy for the UK, earning the nickname “Air miles Andy” as he travelled the world, often at taxpayers’ expense, to hold events in the name of British business.</p>
      <p>Silva, who championed tech policy while in Downing Street, left government in 2013 and now runs the co-working space Second Home. He recounted the meeting in his column for the Evening Standard, which is edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne.</p>
      <p>He said this was the second Buckingham Palace meeting with Andrew where he had felt uncomfortable with the language used.</p>
      <p>Silva claimed the previous year Andrew had told him in another discussion on trade policy: “What you have got to remember is that you’ll never get anywhere by playing the white man.”</p>
      <p>Silva added: “I genuinely didn’t know what he meant, and the discussion moved on. But the phrase ‘playing the white man’ stuck in my head, as I’d never heard it before. So when I got back to my desk, I immediately Googled it.</p>
      <p>“The definition flashed up on my screen: an old-fashioned saying, used during colonial times, meaning that only white people can be trusted to follow the rules, unlike dark-skinned natives.”</p>
