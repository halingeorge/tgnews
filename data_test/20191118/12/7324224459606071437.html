      <p>She now lives in a four-bedroom detached house with her 61-year-old husband Derek.</p>
      <p>Despite her win, she said her children still had to work through their teens and use some of their savings to buy their own homes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– 1996</b>
      </p>
      <p>Deana Sampson, from Sheffield, said she had just £3.60 in her bank account when she won £5,439,681 on October 5 1996.</p>

      <p>The mother-of-two, who lives in a five-bedroom home with her husband Mark, 54, said the win allowed her to “indulge” in her “passion” for singer Robbie Williams.</p>
      <p>She has seen Mr Williams perform around 40 times across the globe since 2001 and met him in Las Vegas for the first time in 2018.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Viv Moss, 68, from Newquay, Cornwall, said she suffered from sickness and diarrhoea for a fortnight after winning £6,048,499 on October 3 1998 – describing the experience as “like an unexpected death”.</p>
      <p>She moved from a four-bedroom home to a five-bed and swapped her eight-year-old Ford Focus for a Bentley.</p>
      <p>Mrs Moss now lives with husband Kevin, 73, and has two grown-up children.</p>

      <p>After winning the lottery, she visited him for one month as part of a £5,000 holiday.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old used some of her winnings to extend her existing house with her 53-year-old partner Malcolm Russell, his son and their three children.</p>
      <p>She was also able to give up work and devote her time to being a mother.</p>

      <p>On breaking the news to his boss, Mr Wragg said: “When I told him I’d had a win, he said: ‘That reminds me, I need to check my ticket.’ I said ‘don’t bother Dave – I won the lot’.”</p>
      <p>Mr Wragg, whose wife Barbara died last year, said they had never left the country before the win and had been on holiday to Torquay in Devon for 31 consecutive years.</p>
      <p>The couple went on a cruise after winning the lottery, which Mr Wragg said they “loved”.</p>
      <p>They also purchased a Range Rover and filled it with Easter eggs for a local school in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>– 2001</p>
      <p>Tom Naylor, 64, from Wheaton Aston, Staffordshire, said he was “absolutely convinced” he would win the lottery one day.</p>
      <p>Then, on November 14 2001 he won £15,528,286.</p>
      <p>He swapped his Ford Granada for two Aston Martins, three Jaguars, a Ford Mustang and a Land Rover Discovery.</p>
      <p>Mr Naylor, who lives with his wife Rita, 62, in a four-bed barn conversion, said his biggest extravagance was a £25,000 trip to New York with nine family members on Concorde.</p>
      <p>“When we saw three giant white stretch limos waiting for us outside the airport, it was an incredible moment,” Mr Naylor said. “I felt 10ft tall.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>– 2002</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sarah Ibbetson, 41, from Leeds, was on maternity leave as a dental nurse when she won £3,013,767 on July 20 2002.</p>
      <p>Her first two purchases – with husband Aldan, 41 – were a Mercedes-Benz and a Porsche. They paid for both vehicles on a debit card.</p>
      <p>The couple, who have three children, also made it on to the bottom of Sunday Times Rich List and started their own number plate business.</p>
      <p>They now live in a five-bed detached house.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Trish Emson, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, won £1,747,728 on October 25 2003.</p>
      <p>At the time she had been saving for IVF treatment after trying for a baby for five-and-a-half years with her partner Graham Norton, 49.</p>
      <p>She said: “A few weeks after our win, we were invited to an England rugby game but the Champagne made me feel sick. Two weeks later, we discovered I was pregnant.”</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old said she bought her son Benjamin, who is now 15, a babygro that read: “millionaire in training”.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Ben Woods from Liverpool said his parents were “white with shock” after they checked his numbers and realised he had won £2,485,736 on February 21 2004.</p>
      <p>On the day of his win he was single, living at home and had gone to the pub after finishing his shift as a railway guard.</p>
      <p>“Mum and dad were sitting there, white with shock, because they’d checked my numbers,” the 38-year-old said.</p>
      <p>“Dad said he needed to talk to me alone in the toilets and I thought: ‘What have I done?’ I was sure I was about to be told off.”</p>
      <p>Mr Woods said the money has paid for 12 trips to New York for his parents and new property.</p>
      <p>He is now a stay-at-home father, living with his wife Leanne and their three children.</p>

      <p>
        <b>– 2006</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mother-of-two Geraldine Bradley said her first thought after winning £3,570,063 on March 11 2006 was she needed to get her ironing done before the press came round.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old,  who lives in Gwynnon, Llanarthne, south-west Wales, with husband Christopher, 48, said her first purchase was a £9.99 KFC to celebrate.</p>

      <p>They now live in a four-bed house with three reception rooms, a snooker room, a maze and a lake.</p>

      <p>“I went from wearing costume jewellery to buying the real thing,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I married Tony in 2010 in a dream wedding and walking down the aisle was one of the most magical moments of my life.”</p>

      <p>The 51-year-old, who lives in a four-bed house in Benfleet, Essex, was working three jobs at the time, servicing vending machines, cleaning and delivering catalogues.</p>
      <p>On the night she won, the mother-of-two said she went to Tesco at midnight in her pyjamas and bought a box of Bonio dog biscuits, because she “couldn’t think of what else to buy”.</p>

      <p>As well as buying a house for each of their adult daughters, Mr Caswell said the money also paid for an emergency operation.</p>
      <p>He said: “I needed an emergency quadruple bypass and instead of waiting our daughter researched the top surgeon and I paid to go private – so the lottery has kept me healthy as well as happy.”</p>
