      <p>This promotional video promotes a car door that slides under the car instead of opening outwards. The terribleness of the idea wedded to the "upper middle-class England in the 1980s" marketing gives it an almost <i>vicious</i> quality, as if intentionally mocking the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EQetm_qWDg">unmoored techno-meritocratic fantasies of the Thatcher era</a>. The car of Hyacinth Bucket's dreams.</p>
      <p>The design saw mass-production with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z1">BMW Z1 coupe</a>, however, and was apparently mechanically reliable enough. It appears the licensor's website at <a href="http://www.disappearing-car-door.com/">disappearing-car-door.com</a> is now dead.</p>
