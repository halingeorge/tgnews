      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - China’s ambassador to London on Monday accused the British government of taking sides in the Hong Kong protests by criticising the police and government.</p>
      <p>“We have made our position known to the British side when they have made irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong. I think when the British government criticise Hong Kong police, criticise the Hong Kong government in handling the situation they are interfering into China’s internal affairs,” ambassador Liu Xiaoming told reporters.</p>
      <p>“They look like they are balanced but as a matter of fact they are taking sides. That is our position.”</p>
      <p>As the ambassador’s news conference was unfolding at the Chinese embassy in London, the British Foreign Office issued the latest in a series of statements on Hong Kong, in which it said Britain was seriously concerned by the escalation in violence from both the protesters and the authorities.</p>
