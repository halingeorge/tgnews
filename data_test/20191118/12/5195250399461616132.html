      <h3>The accident pictures of the Hyundai Venue in a heavy crash show how well the bodyshell has been kept intact</h3>
      <p>Despite being late to the party, Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) launched the long-awaited Venue on May 21. After setting a record of 2,000 bookings in the very first day official reservations opened, the compact SUV went on to scale greater heights as it reached 50,000 reservations in no time.</p>
      <p>As expected, the Venue outsold the segment’s mainstay lead Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza as well a few months ago. It is priced between Rs. 6.50 lakh and Rs. 11.10 lakh (ex-showroom) and comes loaded with several safety features too, apart from the Blue Link connectivity setting it apart from the rest of its rivals.</p>
      <p>A Venue was unfortunately involved in a horrific accident and the pictures have been out revealing some key details. Although the front and rear ends are shattered, the bodyshell of the compact five-seater SUV remains intact. The initial reports indicate that there have been no casualties involved either.</p>
