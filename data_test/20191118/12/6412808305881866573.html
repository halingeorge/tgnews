      <p>The story revolves around Kate, a former singer whose life is on the verge of falling apart. After almost dying from an illness the previous year, she now reluctantly works as an elf at a year-round Christmas store. <br/><br/>Her life takes an unexpected turn when she meets Tom, a stranger who guides her through her difficult times and helps her get her life back on track. Will they get a happy ending? You gotta watch the movie to find out!</p>
      <h4>Here's why 'LAST CHRISTMAS' is set to be the rom com of the year:</h4>
      <h4>1. It stars big names including Henry Golding and Michelle Yeoh who bring some Malaysian flavour to the cast!</h4>
      <p>Emilia Clarke, most loved as the Mother of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen on 'Game of Thrones', will be playing the role of Kate. Our very own Henry Golding will be bringing the character of Tom to life. We can't wait to see what a romance between these two looks like!</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the legendary Michelle Yeoh will be playing a character simply known as 'Santa', who is the owner of the Christmas shop where Kate works. And rounding off this star-studded cast is Emma Thompson, who is taking on the role of Adelia, Kate's eccentric but caring mother.﻿</p>
      <h4>2. From the director to the writers, 'LAST CHRISTMAS' is helmed by a pretty amazing production crew</h4>
      <p>Director Paul Fieg's previous works include hit comedies 'Bridesmaids' and 'Spy', as well as 'A Simple Favour', the recent black comedy mystery film starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively. And besides playing Adelia, Academy Award winner Emma Thompson also co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Bryony Kimmings.</p>

      <h4>3. It's a movie full of reunions, including our favourite mother-son pair from 'Crazy Rich Asians'</h4>
      <p>Former co-stars Henry Golding and Michelle Yeoh will be sharing the screen again (we're so excited for this amgaaadd!), it's gonna be like 'Crazy Rich Asians' for the holidays. This will also be a reunion for Henry Golding and director Paul Feig, as they previously worked together on 'A Simple Favour'.</p>

      <h4>4. It features lots of catchy George Michael songs to get you in the festive mood, including the iconic ‘Last Christmas’, which the movie is inspired by and named after</h4>

      <p>Besides 'Last Christmas', some of the other songs in the movie include 'Heal the Pain' and 'Praying for Time'. Plus, it's even gonna include one of his previously unreleased songs called 'This Is How (We Want You to Get High)'!</p>
      <h4>5. The backstory behind the making of this movie is super touching :')</h4>
      <p>Emma Thompson had already been in discussion with singer George Michael, to make a holiday movie based on the lyrics of one of his hit songs: "Last Christmas, I gave you my heart". He made suggestions to the plot and was even supposed to help with the movie's music supervision.</p>

      <p>Sadly, he passed away on Christmas Day of 2016 and was never able to see this movie brought to life. :( But Emma Thompson pushed through and made sure that the film was made. She even personally sent the script to Paul Feig and requested that he direct the movie.<br/><br/>In an interview with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/paul-feig-dissects-the-twist-at-the-heart-of-last-christmas.html">Vulture</a>, Paul Feig said that "it (George Michael's passing) just made me even more want to make this into a love letter to him, because his DNA is so hard-wired into this story.”</p>
      <h4>Excited to watch 'LAST CHRISTMAS'? Don’t forget to catch it when it hits cinemas nationwide on 28 November 2019!</h4>
