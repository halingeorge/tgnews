      <h1>How to see who did an iMessage tapback on iPhone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:30:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Want to find out who did a tapback on an iMessage? Follow along for how to figure out exactly who tapped back with what expression in a couple of steps.</p>
      <p>Tapbacks are a fun and fast way to respond to iMessages whether its just text, a photo, or video with expressions like thumbs up or down, a heart, or exclamation marks. But especially if you’re in a group message, it can be tricky to keep track of who’s responding with tapbacks.</p>
      <h3>How to see who did an iMessage tapback on iPhone</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the iMessage you want to check</li>
        <li>Long press on the message with a tapback or tapbacks</li>
        <li>You can tap on the people who have used a tapback to see more info (useful if multiple people have done a tapback on the same message, photo, or video)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Use the same steps for <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">iPad</a>. For <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">Mac</a>, do a click and hold to bring up the tapback information.</p>
      <p>Here’s how the process looks on iPhone:</p>

      <p>iPhone users can respond with tapbacks in SMS messages (with both Android and iOS users in the thread) but keep in mind Android users will just see a text translation of the tapback and not see it like it appears above.</p>
