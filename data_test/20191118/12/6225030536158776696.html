      <p>Two high-profile former Rodolphe Brisset trainees are on their way to Dubai to join six-time UAE champion trainer Doug Watson’s Red Stables.</p>
      <p>Multiple Grade 2 winner Quip and recent sales topper Liam’s Legend have entered quarantine in Florida and are expected in Meydan’s quarantine facility in mid-December to point toward the Dubai World Cup Carnival.<br/>“When we saw that Quip was available to buy, we were pretty excited about that,” Watson said. “He’s obviously a talented and accomplished horse, but he looked like he could have used a break in his last race at Churchill and if the break helped him, he’ll be all the better for over here in Dubai.</p>
      <p>"The one thing is that I know he can probably get into the Godolphin Mile on rating, but we’ll also obviously look at the Dubai World Cup with a horse like him because he’s won at nine furlongs.”</p>
      <p>A son of heralded stallion Distorted Humor, Quip was previously owned by breeder WinStar Farm, China Horse Club and SF Racing. HH Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi purchased him after 11 lifetimes starts.</p>
      <p>The bay 4-year-old colt shows four wins, including two Grade 2 affairs, the Tampa Bay Derby in 2018 and this year’s Oaklawn Handicap. The earner of $1,056,951 was also second in the Arkansas Derby (G1) and Stephen Foster (G2) and was last seen finishing off the board in Churchill Downs’ Lukas Classic (G3) in September.</p>
      <p>“He had time off at WinStar and just arrived into quarantine in Ocala with Dave Scanlon,” Watson said. “He just started jogging before heading there and will begin galloping in Ocala and come here."</p>
      <p>Watson said he'll look at the Feb. 6 Al Maktoum Challenge Round 2 (G2) and the Feb. 13 Firebreak (G3) as starting points.</p>
      <p>Like Quip, previously Brisset-conditioned Liam’s Legend made himself known with a sharp, late-October Keeneland juvenile maiden score. The attractive gray colt was sold for $325,000 on Nov. 12 to Saudi Arabian owner Khalid Mishref, topping the racing stock portion of the Keeneland November Breeding Stock Sale. He was previously owned by Niall Brennan, Michael Ryan and Mike Anderson Racing and returned to the work tab two days prior to his sale with a sharp half-mile drill in 48 flat.<br/>“For me, the one thing I really liked about Liam’s Legend is he hit the front and was going away and that was a nine-furlong race,” Watson said. “I know it was on a sloppy track, but I believe he probably would have won like that either way and it shows that he wants to stay the trip, which is key here when the distances get longer in races like the UAE Derby.</p>
      <p>"We will try to make the UAE 2000 Guineas (G3) with him and I’m sure his owner will probably want to run in the new Saudi race for 3-year-olds before the UAE Derby. You don’t win at Keeneland in a 2-year-old maiden if you’re not pretty good, so I’m very happy to have him.”</p>
