      <h1>Google Stadia expands launch day line-up with ten more games</h1>
      <h2>For a total of twenty two titles, ahead of tomorrow's debut</h2>

      <h4>What just happened? Stadia's day-one catalog of twelve games could certainly do with more content, and the company has now nearly doubled it with an additional ten games that were previously scheduled for availability later this year.</h4>
      <p>Last week, Google <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82724-google-reveals-12-launch-day-titles-stadia.html">revealed</a> its rather small library of twelve games playable at launch with fourteen more to be added before the year's end. While the announcement left many fans disappointed, some might be pleased to know that ten games from the service's post-launch period have now made it into Stadia's day-one catalog.</p>

      <p>The new additions bring much needed variety to the platform, including racing and sports games that were lacking in the original line-up, while Stadia Pro players will get Samurai Showdown as the second freebie to go with Destiny 2, the only free to play game being offered initially.</p>
      <p>Google Stadia will now be launching tomorrow with these games:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2</li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection (Stadia Pro)</li>
        <li>Farming Simulator 2019</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
        <li>Football Manager 2020</li>
        <li>Grid 2019</li>
        <li>Gylt</li>
        <li>Just Dance 2020</li>
        <li>Kine</li>
        <li>Metro Exodus</li>
        <li>Mortal Kombat 11</li>
        <li>NBA 2K20</li>
        <li>Rage 2</li>
        <li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Samurai Shodown (Stadia Pro)</li>
        <li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Thumper</li>
        <li>Tomb Raider 2013</li>
        <li>Trials Rising</li>
        <li>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Though the list still leaves much to be desired, it's certainly an improvement that almost doubles the previous launch line-up. Lack of content, however, is just one of the many challenges facing Stadia in the short- and long-term.</p>
      <p>Many users feel that the service might have been rushed out the door since we recently came to know that it will be <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82769-stadia-lack-several-features-launch-including-4k-streaming.html">missing several features on launch</a>, including 4K streaming on PC. Then there's the sword hanging over Stadia, and subsequently developers, who fear that Google '<a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82760-stadia-launch-title-creator-other-devs-worried-google.html">is just going to cancel</a>' the service.</p>
      <p>The biggest threat though, apart from traditional gaming platforms, is competition from Microsoft. The latter has and will be spending a couple of months testing xCloud in closed beta before going live sometime next year, with a game library that <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82785-microsoft-xcloud-preview-adds-50-games-shoots-2020.html">recently expanded by 50 titles</a> in its preview phase alone, likely giving users much less to complain about in terms of content when it ultimately arrives in 2020.</p>
      <p>For now though, Google has its fingers crossed with Stadia that's just one day away from launch in 14 countries, including the United States, Canada, UK, Germany, Sweden, France, and Italy.</p>
