      <p>On-loan goalkeeper O’Leary has missed three games with an ankle injury picked up in the League One defeat at Wycombe.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Norburn missed the opportunity to make his Grenada debut with a viral infection.</p>
      <p>Boss Ricketts confirmed both are back in contention for the Valley Parade tie after the sides drew 1-1 at Montgomery Waters Meadow last time out.</p>
      <p>He said: “Max is in contention. He’s not really had a full training session yet. We need to assess him.</p>
      <p>“He’s not done everything to be 100 per cent clear to be back in but he’s certainly better than he was last week.</p>
      <p>“Ollie had a viral infection which prevented him from making his debut but he should be in contention.”</p>
      <p>Defensive duo Aaron Pierre and Omar Beckles, who had permission to return early from Grenada duty, experienced a difficult journey back from the Caribbean that included delays and stop-overs.</p>
      <p>Pierre and Beckles returned to training today.</p>
