      <p>We’ve got an interesting trailer for an indie action drama entitled <b><i>The Great War</i></b>. The film was written and directed by <b>Steven Luke</b>, who has previous credits under the name <b>Luke Schuetzle</b>, such as <i>Dust of War</i> and <i>War Pigs</i>. Clearly, he’s a big fan of the genre. Here’s the synopsis for the film:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>During the final days of World War I in 1918, a regiment of daring African-American "Buffalo Soldiers" is trapped deep behind enemy lines. After one of these soldiers manages to escape, he’s ordered to join a select team of white troops, led by a battle-scarred officer, to find and rescue the survivors. Casting aside their racial differences, the determined men join forces to find their lost comrades in this gripping, action-filled tale of bravery and unity.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The film’s cast includes <b>Bates Wilder</b> (<i>Joy</i>), <b>Hiram Murray</b> (<i>General Hospital</i>), <b>Billy Zane</b> (<i>Titanic</i>), <b>Rich Lowe</b> (<i>The Least of All</i>), <b>Bill Cooper</b> (<i>Prodigal</i>), and <b>Ron Perlman</b> (<i>Sons of Anarchy</i>). This looks fairly low budget for a war movie, but hopefully it will have a great story to carry it through. Check out the trailer below, and see <i>The Great War</i> in theaters and on VOD on December 13th.</p>
