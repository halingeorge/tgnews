        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Often news debates on television channels turn into heated arguments among the panellists, but this discussion seems to have touched a new-low as one of its panellists called for “death for death” and “rape for rape” on the issue of the Kashmiri Pandits’ exodus in 1990.</b>

      <blockquote>During a high-decibel discussion on the exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits (Hindus) in 1990 on national news, Major General S.P. Sinha (Retd.) started screaming "Maut ke badle maut (death for death) and “Balatkar ke Badle Balatkar (rape for rape)" to avenge the atrocities and exodus of Hindu minorities living in Muslim majority <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077317099-indian-minister-slams-western-coverage-of-situation-in-kashmir-over-alleged-bias/">Indian Kashmir</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>The statement drew instant ire among the fellow panelists, news anchor and live audience at the studio of TV 9 Bharatvarsh.</p>
      <p>The army has also distanced itself from the comments of the retired officer, saying after the retirement of an officer, they do not come under the purview of Code of Conduct for serving personnel or the Army Act.</p>
      <p>The debate’s video is going viral on social media, drawing the widespread condemnation of army veterans and netizens for sullying the reputation of India's Armed Forces.</p>
