      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): Foreign interest in Malaysian bond market was somewhat muted in October, according to RAM Rating Services Bhd (RAM Ratings), with a net outflow of RM541.31 million compared to September's net inflow of RM908 million.</p>
      <p>RAM Rating's head of research Kristina Fong said this was mainly driven by a perceived change in investors’ preference to higher risk-return assets such as equities, amid renewed optimism on US-China trade talks in October.</p>
      <p>“This was highlighted by the strong rally by the S&amp;P 500 and the FBM KLCI in the same month,” she said in a statement.</p>
      <p>According to RAM Ratings, the upward shift in US interest rate expectations had also pushed US Treasury (UST) yields to a more attractive level, which may have prompted yield-seeking investors to switch away from Malaysian bonds.</p>
      <p>The rating agency said the market had been gradually pricing in less easing by the US Federal Reserve (Fed), as indicated by the persistent uptrend in long-term yields in the last two months. These expectations were reaffirmed during the Fed’s most recent monetary policy meeting on Oct 30, 2019. "Despite implementing its third rate cut this year, the Fed had exhibited a less dovish stance, while also signalling a pause in rate movements," the agency noted.</p>
      <p>Given the Fed’s overall tone, the benchmark 10-year UST yield continued trending upwards, extending October’s pattern of declining yield differentials between the 10-year Malaysia Government Securities (MGS) and UST, it said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, government bond issuance in Malaysia was relatively robust in October. MGS and Government Investment Issue (GII) issuance summed up to RM9 billion, compared to RM5.5 billion in the preceding month.</p>
      <p>“This brought the issuance level to RM102 billion in the 10 months of 2019 — on track towards meeting our forecast of RM110 billion-RM120 billion for the year. Going forward, we anticipate MGS/GII issuance to increase to RM115 billion-RM125 billion in 2020, taking into account the Government’s deficit financing requirements under Budget 2020 and the refinancing of maturing debts next year,” RAM Ratings said.</p>
      <p>In October, corporate bond issuance remained relatively healthy, amounting to RM5.9 billion (September: RM14.9 billion).</p>
      <p>In view of the healthy pace of issuance to date, corporate issuance stood at RM112.1 billion as at end-October, topping the lower end of the rating agency’s forecast of RM110 billion-RM120 billion for 2019.</p>
