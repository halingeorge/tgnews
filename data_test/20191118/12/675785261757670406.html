      <p>Sky and BT Broadband have both crashed in a day of misery for internet users. </p>
      <p>According to Down Detector, the issues with Sky started at around 06:58 GMT, and affected users in the south of the UK, including in London, Reading, Cardiff and Southampton.</p>
      <p>Thousands of users have reported problems this morning. Of those who reported issues, 95% said the couldn’t access the Internet, while 3% were having TV issues, and 1% having a total blackout.</p>
      <p>And BT customers later also faced problems, although BT claims there were no issues.</p>
      <p>A BT spokesperson said: "We’ve checked our network and there were no broadband outages affecting BT customers. We also haven’t received any increase in social media traffic or call centre activity from customers reporting any problems. If BT customers experience any problems affecting their phone or internet services we would encourage them to report this to us as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>Sky says that it is aware of the issue, and is "working hard to fix this."</p>

      <p>It tweeted: "We are aware of an issue affecting some of our customers broadband across parts of the UK, we’re sorry for this. We have the right people working hard to fix this."</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, many customers are furious at the outage, with many taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to vent their issues.</p>
      <p>One user replied: "Oh, you noticed. That’s nice. Will you be giving us all a reduction in our bills, or compensating those of us who are self-employed and having to chew through our mobile data plans to get any work done? No? Thought not. Looking to move now."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Nightmare when working from home."</p>
      <p>And one joked: "Waking up this morning to find my sky broadband is down , what a great start to the day .... how am I supposed to watch my cats do the silliest things to motivate me through my Monday morning."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted the providers for comment.</p>
