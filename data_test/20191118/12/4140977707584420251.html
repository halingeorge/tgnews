          </p>
          <p>The Abu Dhabi T10 League is under full swing and later today we will be witnessing the 12<sup>th</sup> match of the competition between Bangla Tigers and Delhi Bulls. All the 4 teams in Group A have a 50-50 record in the competition. Bangla Tigers are currently at the top of Group A owing to their net run rate. Delhi Bulls have also managed a victory but are at the bottom of the points table due to their inferior net run rate.</p>
          <p>Delhi Bulls kicked off the competition with a resounding victory against the Deccan Gladiators in the 2<sup>nd</sup> match of the tournament. On the other hand, Deccan Gladiators defeated Bangla Tigers in their opening clash. Delhi lost their 2<sup>nd</sup> clash against the Karnataka Tuskers by 19 runs while the Bangla Tigers bounced back strongly in their next encounter defeating Karnataka Tuskers by 5 wickets.</p>

                <h3>Pitch Conditions and Toss</h3>
                <p>It has been a relatively high scoring venue in Abu Dhabi. Given the nature of this format, a batsmen have to start going after the bowlers from the word go and a score of 100 is a par first innings total on most wickets in a T10 game. The Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi has seen high scoring encounters and it won’t be any different today. However, the pitch has something on offer for the bowlers which has kept them interested. The Team winning the toss might be tempted to chase the target down.</p>

                            <h3>DEB vs BAT Dream 11 Wicket-keeper</h3>
                            <p>Picking two wicket-keepers will be an ideal option in this match as both Kusal Perera and Andre Fletcher are top-order batsmen and can take any bowling line-up to the cleaners. Andre Fletcher scored a sensational 15 balls 40 in the previous clash against Karnataka Tuskers. On the other hand Kusal Perera hasn’t been in the best of touches but a big knock might just be around the corner. In T10 matches it is very important to pick top-order batters as batsmen sitting in the dugout won’t fetch you points.</p>
                            <h3>DEB vs BAT Dream 11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>The English skipper Eoin Morgan doesn’t need any introduction. Given his talent and big-hitting abilities he is a must in any Dream 11 team especially when it is a 10 overs clash. The southpaw is a phenomenal hitter of the ball and can take any bowling attack to the cleaners.</p>
                            <p>Colin Ingram, the South African left-handed batsman is one of the most stylish batsmen in the competition. He has the ability to play the 2<sup>nd</sup> fiddle and also goes hammers and tongs whenever the team is in need. He was unfortunately run out in the previous encounter. He will definitely look to make amends in today’s clash.</p>
                            <p>Paul Stirling, the Irish opener will be our next pick in this segment. Over the years Stirling has been a prolific run-scorer for Ireland and has the ability to play the big shots on a consistent basis. He scored a whirlwind 12 of just 4 deliveries in the previous clash which included a couple of sixes.</p>
                            <h3>DEB vs BAT Dream 11 All-rounders</h3>
                            <p>English left-arm seamer David Willey will be the first pick in this segment. He has been a wicket-taking option for his captain and can also smash some lusty blows with the bat. Willey is an ideal pick in any dream 11 team especially for a 10 overs game.</p>
                            <p>Thisara Perera, the Sri Lankan swashbuckling all-rounder hasn’t been at his best in the last year or so but in a 10 overs clash the current form hardly matters. He can provide some important wickets in the death overs and some lusty blows will definitely be on his agenda later today.</p>
                            <p>David Wiese is another important member of any T20 team. His immaculate slower deliveries make him a wicket-taking option and with the bat, he can smash the ball a long way. Weise has been plying his trade for several franchises all over the world and has represented them with authority.</p>
                            <h3>DEB vs BAT Dream 11 Bowlers</h3>
                            <p>The first pick in this segment will be Ravi Rampaul. He bowled brilliantly in the last match and conceded just 9 runs in his two overs. As he bowls the death overs, Rampaul will get an opportunity to get some easy wickets in the end. It is very important to chose a bowler who will start of the innings and finish it off as well.</p>
                            <p>Dushmantha Chameera will be the 2<sup>nd</sup> pick due to his wicket-taking abilities. He has bagged two wickets ad will look to add some more to his kitty.</p>
                            <p>Adil Rashid might be a risky choice but a wrist spinner always tends to get more wickets than finger spinners. Hence it might be worth taking this risk.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>The captain of the day will be Andre Fletcher while our vice-captain will be Paul Stirling.</p>
