      <h1>Half-Life: Alyx is Valve’s big VR game, reveal set for The Game Awards – rumour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:07:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Valve’s flagship VR project is rumoured to be getting unveiled soon.</p>
      <p>When Valve announced pre-order details for its then-upcoming <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/04/30/valve-index-specs-pre-orders-release-date/">Index VR headset</a>, the developer said it’s working on a flagship VR game, but didn’t drop any hints as it to what it could be.</p>
      <p>It now appears, according to a new rumour, that it’s a VR-only Half-Life game called <b>Half-Life: Alyx</b>, which, as you might have guessed, stars Alyx Vance.</p>
      <p>A person who apparently previously leaked the existence of Dota Underlords posted a transcript of an interview segment intended to be aired at this year’s Game Awards ceremony on December 12. The pre-recorded segment apparently sees host Geoff Keighley travel to Valve’s HQ to talk to Robin Walker, and another unnamed person, about the project.</p>
      <p>“But why does this have to be VR only? Which you know is a fair concern for people, right? It’s like, are they forcing me to buy VR to have the next “Half-Life” experience?” asks Keighley in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7Dke__WLzyTzDg1omSrSzy5alzbUhsC8kZZ8anAhqk/edit">the leaked transcript</a>.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard, but as we said, it began as an exploration of VR,” a Valve developer is quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The game is apparently set for release in March, 2020, though the transcript is not very clear on that point.</p>
      <p>Keighley previously produced three episodes of his behind-the-scenes series The Final Hours on Valve’s games, and in the leaked interview promises to release another that focuses on the development of Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that you should take this with a heavy pinch of salt for now, even if the meat of the leak itself is very plausible. Hit the link above to read the rest of the leaked transcript.</p>
