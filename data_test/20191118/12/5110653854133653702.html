      <h1>Bears bench struggling Mitchell Trubisky for final drive, citing a hip injury as cover</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:16:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Gatto</a></address>
      <p>Bears coach Matt Nagy said Sunday night that quarterback Mitchell Trubisky wasn't healthy enough to finish the team's <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/game-center/los-angeles-rams-vs-chicago-bears/dvtth7n5y7buv2bpojqhqdze2">17-7 loss to the Rams</a> in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Trubisky was trying to play through soreness in his right hip, Nagy told reporters in his postgame press conference. Nagy replaced Trubisky with Chase Daniel with 3:31 remaining in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>"It was all based off of he just wasn't feeling right. His hip was hurting him," Nagy said. "We knew it a few series earlier that something wasn't right." Per <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2019/11/18/20970189/bears-mitch-trubisky-super-frustrated-right-hip-injury-matt-nagy-rams-17-7-final-score-quarterback">the Chicago Sun-Times</a>, Trubisky said he alerted quarterbacks coach Dave Ragone earlier in the second half and that Ragone later informed Nagy. With Trubisky struggling to throw properly, Nagy said, he told Trubisky on the sideline that the quarterback needed to "be honest" about the injury.</p>

      <p>Trubisky said in his own postgame press conference that he began feeling the stiffness at the end of the second quarter. He acknowledged it was affecting his throwing but that he still tried to "fight through" what he was feeling.</p>
      <p>"I just couldn't move around like I wanted to," he said. "Just throwing with a lot of arm."</p>
