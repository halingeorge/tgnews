      <h1>Outrage after dog is 'dumped from car' in Saltash</h1>
      <h2>The dog 'chased' behind the car - but the driver didn't stop</h2>

      <p>Residents have expressed their outrage after a woman reported seeing the owner of a vehicle 'dump' their dog on the side of a Saltash road and then drive off - leaving the pet behind.</p>
      <p>It's believed an older man dumped the dog on the side of the road and drove off, before the dog 'chased' behind the car - but the driver didn't stop.</p>
      <p>The incident is alleged to have happened on Friday, November 15, on Old Ferry Road in Saltash and the dog owner has been described by a witness as a 'older, slim, dark-haired man'.</p>
      <p>The dog is believed to be an older, black/grey and white collie-type dog.</p>
      <p>Police have been informed and local residents are currently searching the area for the dog, but haven't found the animal yet.</p>
      <p>A Saltash resident witnessed the incident and asked friends to share it on social media.</p>
      <p>A friend shared the incident on Facebook on behalf of an elderly lady from Saltash who witnessed the dog being left and then tried to rescue it.</p>
      <p>The post said: "Dog dumped from car: Saltash, Old Ferry Road.</p>
      <p>"An older, slim, dark-haired man dumped dog on side of road and drove off, dog chased behind car but he didn't stop.</p>
      <p>"[It happened on] Friday Nov 15, approx midday. [There was a] dark coloured car, the dog was an older black/grey and white collie type dog.</p>
      <p>"This was witnessed by an elderly lady who couldn't get to the dog, she has informed local police and her friend Janet Duffy has been out in car and on foot to search for the dog but nothing as yet."</p>
