      <h1>Paris-based EdTech startup Lalilo raises €5 million to help more kids learning to read at their own pace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:34:34+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.eu-startups.com/author/thomas-ohr/" target="_blank">Thomas Ohr</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://lalilo.com/">Lalilo</a>, a Paris-based EdTech startup that helps students learn to read at their own pace, is entering an acceleration phase in France and abroad. Founded in 2016 by three engineers, the young company aims to solve the challenge of supporting a growing number of struggling readers by putting technology and artificial intelligence in the hands of teachers.</p>
      <p>Lalilo is an online tool that Kindergarten-2nd grade teachers can use in the classroom to differentiate reading instruction. The program guides students through exercises on targeted foundational reading skills while teachers receive detailed data on their performance. Thousands of students already use Lalilo in USA and France. Each month, more than 5.000 teachers and 90.000 students complete several million exercises in their classrooms.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>Lalilo is an online literacy program with 2 parts:</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A playful and interactive world: students work on more than 3.000 adaptive exercises in phonics, word recognition, and comprehension.</li>
        <li>A data reporting: teachers can track whole class and individual progress. They can also assign specific lessons</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While already helping French students in their literacy journey, Lalilo is now expanding beyond the national and European market. From its inception, Lalilo has been focused on the US EdTech market. To advance this drive for growth beyond France, Lalilo raised a new round of €5 million from Partech, EduCapital, and Citizen Capital.</p>
      <p><i>“We are proud to have raised with three funds which reflect Lalilo’s dynamics: international ambition with Partech, education with EduCapital, and social impact with Citizen Capital.”</i> stated, Amine Mezzour – Co-founder of Lalilo.</p>
      <p>In France, Lalilo was also just granted a prestigious partnership with the Ministry of Education. The innovation partnership, entitled “development of a teaching assistant based on artificial intelligence technologies for the learning of literacy and STEM,” finances a 12-month Research &amp; Development phase for three selected projects in both STEM and literacy. At the end of the first R&amp;D phase, selected projects will continue through a six-month scaling-up phase after which they can then be bought by the State to be implemented in French classrooms.</p>
