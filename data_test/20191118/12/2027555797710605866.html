      <p>The Karnataka government would contemplate the setting up of a Karnataka Technology Development Board to promote information technology and knowledge economy, said state Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Monday.</p>

      <p>He said that during an interaction with the industry leaders after becoming Chief Minister, he had promised them a legal framework for promoting innovation through a statute, which he fulfilled by setting up the Karnataka Innovation Authority through legislation.</p>
