      <p>There is just over one month left before the new year and Soccer Laduma takes a look at up to 10 players who could be hot property in January, with their contracts approaching the last six months.</p>
      <p>Several players in the Premier Soccer League will be eligible to put pen to paper on a pre-contract elsewhere come January next year and possibly leave their current clubs on a free at the end of the season.</p>

      <p>George Maluleka in particular has long been linked with a new contract at Naturena, although as things stand, the player will be free to put pen to paper with any interested suitor once January arrives, with the midfielder having recently been linked with a move to Mamelodi Sundowns.</p>
      <p>Also at Naturena, the likes of Joseph Malongoane, Willard Katsande and Daniel Akpeyi will also enter the final six months of their contracts and it remains to be seen whether Amakhosi will offer the duo a new contract before interested suitors make an approach. </p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the Absa Premiership, Maritzburg United’s Siyanda Xulu is yet to sign a new contract at the club, although sources have revealed that the player is eyeing a move abroad. </p>
      <p>At Mamelodi Sundowns, Oupa Manyisa, Soumahoro Bangaly and Anele Ngcongca are some of the players at the club who will enter the final six months of their deals in January and as things stand, indications are that Ngcongca is the player who is likely to sign a new deal at the club before looking elsewhere. </p>
      <p>Clayton Daniels at SuperSport United and Siphelele Mthembu at Cape Town City are also amongst the many players in PSL who will be eligible to sign a pre-contracts elsewhere in January and it remains to be seen what the upcoming transfer window will entail.</p>
