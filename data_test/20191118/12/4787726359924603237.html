        <b>, playing just as important a role as your playing style or your guitar’s bracing pattern or tonewood. But with so many types available, choosing the best acoustic guitar strings for you isn’t easy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are so many decisions to make on material, gauge, and price. Coated strings have made huge advances in terms of tone and feel, and are an increasingly popular choice among acoustic players looking to extend the life of their strings. They invariably enhance higher frequencies, too, but all this comes at a price – quite literally, as coated strings are typically more expensive.</p>
      <p>Many of the string sets in our buyer’s guide are coated, but we've included some alternatives, options for all budgets, and some more traditional acoustic guitar strings, too.</p>

      <h4>The best acoustic guitar strings right now</h4>
      <p>Not only do Martin make some of the best acoustic guitars in the world, they make some of the best strings, too. The Martin SP Lifespan acoustic strings are coated with Cleartone technology to extend their life and have an excellent frequency response and feel. And for coated strings, they present excellent value.</p>
      <p>Developed with US acoustic guitar giants Taylor, Elixir’s Nanoweb HD also provide a solid, pronounced low-end and bright highs, with less of the finger squeak that can be a nails-down-the-blackboard moment when playing. Plus, they won’t go dead on you after three days of heavy playing.  </p>
      <h4>The best acoustic guitar strings: buying advice</h4>
      <p><b>Gauges<br/></b>All of the string sets featured here come in a variety of gauges. The string gauge - the thickness or diameter of the string - has an impact on your tone and technique, and on your guitar.</p>
      <p>Thicker strings will sound fuller, with a more rounded low end, and on balance they tend to be louder. They’re more durable, too. Fewer string breaks? That’s great. But there are drawbacks. For players who are still building strength in their fretting hands, thick gauges can make for a chastening playing experience, especially if you are a finger-picker or like to play fast runs and bend your strings. If you are a folky strummer, heavier might be a better option.</p>

          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lighter gauge strings are easier to get a handle on, to fret and bend, and they sound a lot brighter. The trade-off is that you lose some of that bottom end. For some players that is worth it. But not all.</p>
      <p>Take a look at your guitar, too. For smaller bodied guitars, lighter gauge strings might complement the sound better, and vice-versa, with thicker strings a better fit sound-wise for larger bodied jumbo and concert models. Guitar strings are measured in 1/000th of an inch, and packaged in sets that are typically referred to by their thinnest string, the high E. So a “set of 12s” will have a high E string that has a 12 gauge, measuring 0.012-inches across its diameter.</p>
      <p><b>Here is a generic guide to acoustic guitar string gauges:<br/></b>Extra light: .010 .014 .023 .030 .039 .047<br/>Custom light: .011 .015 .023 .032 .042 .052<br/>Light: .012 .016 .025 .032 .042 .054<br/>Medium: .013 .017 .026 .035 .045 .056<br/>Heavy: .014 .018 .027 .039 .049 .059</p>
      <p><b>Materials<br/></b>Acoustic guitar strings are commonly made of bronze, phosphor bronze, brass, nickel, silk and steel.</p>
      <p>Each material has its own timbre. Bronze sounds bright, with bell-like clarity and a wide treble-forward frequency response. As the name suggests, phosphor bronze sees phosphor added to the alloy to slow oxidation and extend string life. Phosphor bronze strings tend to sound a little darker and warmer than bronze. </p>

          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Brass strings have plenty of top-end jangle, nickel strings have warmer tone, make an excellent vintage choice, as does monel – a nickel-based alloy that many guitarists swear by for getting the best out of their tonewood.</p>
      <p><b>What about nylon strings?<br/></b>If you’ve got a classical guitar, you’ll need nylon strings. In a set of classical strings, the top three strings are made from clear or rectified nylon, with the bottom three typically using bronze or silverplayed copper wire wrapped around a multi-filament core. </p>
      <p>Classical guitar strings are referred to as having high or low tension, with high tension strings offering a heavier feel and low tension a more easy to play feel. </p>
      <p><b>The good news? Strings are not expensive<br/></b>Our biggest piece of advice would be to pick up a few options and get restringing and experimenting! What feels light to one player may pose a struggle to others. But guitar strings are cheap enough that you can try a few sets without breaking the bank. The more you experiment, the sooner you find a set that gives you the tone and feel you want.</p>

      <p>Elixir is the first name in coated guitar strings, and this coated phosphor bronze light/medium hybrid (0.013-0.053) set has been treated with Nanoweb, which not only keeps the strings fresh longer, and protects the entire string, but reduces finger squeak. It's designed to provide a warmer bottom-end and bolder top-end with some mid projection boost in between.</p>

      <p>The ‘cryogenic processing’ with liquid nitrogen that Dean Markley use for the Blue Steel range may sound a little like something from a sci-fi movie, but by freezing strings to -320 degrees Fahrenheit and then gradually bringing the temperature up, greater frequency response and tuning stability is claimed.</p>

      <p>We highly recommend sampling a range of coated strings from various brands in order to narrow down your preferences. The New York company’s EXP range should be on your list. D’Addario claims that its coating offers more of the natural feel you get with uncoated strings, while still having the life-extending benefits of the coated types.</p>

      <p>A back-to-the-future move from Martin saw these strings launched back in 2014; think of these as a vintage string. Returning to the old nickel-based alloy blend of monel results in a softer touch and warm tone, to bring out the inherent tone in your acoustic’s wood. There’s also a claimed longer life than some other phosphor or 80/20 options.</p>

      <p>Available in light, normal and high tensions, these classical strings from D’Addario are manufactured in the USA and have a wonderful punchy and bright tone. They might be classical by name, classical by nature, but the custom-extruded treble strings are produced by a state-of-the-art, computer-controlled laser.</p>

Designed under the watchful eye of Gibson’s acoustic guitar builders, these phosphor bronze strings balance a sharp brightness that rounds out as it sustains.</p>

      <p>La Bella coats its strings in a different way to others; changing the actual surface of the string during the Ionic Vapor Process where “propriety compounds are activated in a glow discharge electromagnetic plasma to modify the surface”. The result is a string the company says lasts five times longer than non-treated strings and sound brighter than the coated competition. They are not cheap but many players swear by their dynamics. </p>
