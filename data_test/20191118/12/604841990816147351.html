      <p>Filming has commenced in Belfast, Northern Ireland, for Virgin Media Television’s brand new crime thriller series ‘The Deceived’. <br/> <br/>Written by Derry Girls’ creator Lisa McGee and Tobias Beer, the four-part drama produced by New Pictures (The Missing and Catherine The Great) will air on Virgin Media One and Channel 5 (in the UK) in 2020. <br/> <br/>A compelling, sinister narrative of lust, manipulation and betrayal, the central character in The Deceived is student Ophelia (Emily Reid - Curfew), who falls in love with her timelessly attractive and charismatic, but married college lecturer, Dr Michael Callaghan played by Irish actor Emmet J Scanlan, (Krypton, Peaky Blinders, The Fall,) seeing in him all the answers to her needs. When their affair results in a shocking and tragic death, Ophelia finds herself trapped in a world where she can no longer trust her own mind. <br/> <br/>Catherine Walker (Shetland, Versailles) plays his wife Roisin, a successful, award-winning fiction writer; Eleanor Methven (Little Women) plays Roisin's devoted and sometimes overbearing mother Mary Mulvery; Ian McElhinney (Game of Thrones, Derry Girls) is Michael's father Hugh fighting the oncoming tide of dementia; Shelley Conn (Liar) plays Roisin's best friend Ruth, intelligent and loyal, and Dempsey Bovell (Patrick Melrose) is Michael's confidante and biggest admirer, Matthew.<br/> <br/> </p>
