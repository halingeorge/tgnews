      <h1>Who won the NASCAR championship 2019? Full results, highlights from the Cup Series title race at Homestead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:18:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:18</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>The 2019 NASCAR Cup Series came to an anticlimactic end Sunday, with Kyle Busch winning at Homestead-Miami Speedway by nearly 5 seconds over Martin Truex Jr. to secure his second career championship.</p>
      <p>After the final pit stops were completed, Busch's lead was never threatened. Truex, a playoff driver who dominated the race early, trailed by more than 8 seconds and needed a caution to have a chance to catch Busch.</p>
      <p>But there was only one caution all evening outside of post-stage yellows, and it happened in Stage 2. That prevented a dramatic finish and allowed Busch to breathe easy down the stretch.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Truex led 103 laps Sunday and won the first stage going away. His fate turned during a second-stage pit stopwhen his crew switched the wrong tires. He was forced to head back down pit road immediately. He received the free pass on a caution and was back among the leaders shortly after but never controlled the race again.</p>
      <p>Denny Hamlin, who had the pole but lost the lead quickly, had an even more consequential pit mishap. He was fighting for the lead entering the final round of stops, but a piece of grill tape was placed over too much of the grill. That forced a second stop to avoid overheating. He finished 11th.</p>
      <p>The fourth driver racing for the championship, Kevin Harvick, led for 41 laps and had the lead briefly after a late restart, but he quickly fell back to a distant fourth.</p>
      <p>Busch had by far the fastest car in the second half of the race. He won the second stage and led 120 laps overall. His second Cup championship is his first without a bit of an asterisk —his 2015 title came during a season in which he received a medical waiver due to injury.</p>
