      <h1>Saracens: Why we're not appealing salary cap punishment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:02:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Ciarán Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>Saracens have confirmed that they will not be appealing the £5.4million fine and 35-point penalty imposed for salary cap infractions over the course of the past three seasons.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Saracens chairman Nigel Wray outlined the reasons why the club have decided not to contest the decision.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> table has already been updated to show the club sitting rock bottom on -22 points.</p>
      <p>“Saracens today confirms that it is not going to appeal the recent ruling of the independent panel in relation to salary cap breaches,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>“Any review or further appeal would be a costly, time consuming and destabilising exercise and so for the good of the game, the Premiership and this wonderful club and all its great people, a club which I have loved and served for 25 years, we have decided not to appeal but to take our punishment and hopefully soon put this behind us. </p>
      <p>“I recognise that the arrangements between myself and players, made in good faith, which comprise the material element of the charges, should have been brought to the attention of the salary cap manager for consultation prior to entering into them.</p>

      <p>“It is significant that following extensive investigations the independent panel stated that we have “not deliberately sought to circumvent the regulations” albeit we recognise that some of our actions were considered to be “reckless”.</p>
      <p>“As chairman, I must take full responsibility for the arrangements that led to this outcome. It is important to stress that our excellent coaching staff were not involved in these issues in any way.</p>
      <p>“In addition, we can confirm that we are complying strictly with the salary cap regulations in the current season and will continue to work transparently with Premiership Rugby in this regard.  </p>

      <p>“We will shortly introduce robust independent governance measures acceptable to all, including the appointment to the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> board of a director, who will oversee a new governance regime. I will continue as always to support the club financially going forwards to ensure there is no financial instability or uncertainty.</p>
      <p>“This amazing club, which has been such a huge part of my family’s life and indeed of many, many others, has produced an incredible number of world-class rugby players. About ten of our current team have been together for between seven and ten years, as indeed have all the coaches; fourteen players have played over one hundred times for the Club and for me it is the caring and the closeness of everyone in the Saracens Family that achieves success throughout every part of our wide-ranging Saracens activities, both on the field and away from it.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps we have done the wrong thing for the right reasons, but we must now draw a line and come together as Saracens to fully support our players, our coaches and our hard-working staff.”</p>
