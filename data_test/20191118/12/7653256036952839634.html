      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Vodafone">Vodafone</a> Idea Limited (VIL) Monday said that it would increase its tariff from December 1. The announcement has come on the backdrop of its highest quarterly loss of Rs 50,922 crore amid an adverse Supreme Court ruling on adjusted gross revenue (AGR).</p>
      <p>“Vodafone Idea will suitably increase the prices of its tariffs effective 1 December 2019,” the Mumbai-based telco in a statement said.</p>
      <p>The telco has added that the mobile data charges in India were by far the cheapest in the world even as the demand for mobile data services continues to grow rapidly.</p>
      <p>Indian <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/telecom">telecom</a> carriers have the lowest average revenue per user worldwide with Vodafone Idea’s subscriber revenue at nearly Rs 105 a month.</p>
      <p>In October, Bharti Airtel said mobile services tariff were unsustainable in the present scenario and that needed to be increased.</p>

      <p>Following the top court’s verdict on October 24, asking telecom companies to pay as much as Rs 1.30 lakh crore to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), the government has set up a Committee of Secretaries (CoS) to look into relief measures to bail out the stressed sector.</p>
      <p>“The acute financial stress in the telecom sector has been acknowledged by all stakeholders and a high-level Committee of Secretaries (CoS) headed by the Cabinet Secretary is looking into providing appropriate relief, the telco said.</p>
      <p>The telco, however, reiterated its commitment to play its due role in realising the vision of Digital India by continuing to provide seamless mobile services to customers across India.</p>
      <p>“VIL will continue to actively invest in making its network future-fit by embedding new age technologies and launching new products and services to cater to the evolving needs of its over 300 million customers,” the telco added.</p>
