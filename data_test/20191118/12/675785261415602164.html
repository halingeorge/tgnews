      <p>Saracens have chosen not to appeal against their 35-point deduction and £5.36million fine for salary cap breaches.</p>
      <p>The English and European champions and Premiership Rugby have released a joint statement declaring the verdict of the independent disciplinary panel will stand unchallenged.</p>
      <p>In an apparent admission of guilt, Saracens chairman Nigel Wray said: "We have made mistakes and so, with humility, we must accept these penalties.</p>
      <p>"As a club, we will now pull together and meet the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
      <p>"We confirm our commitment to the salary cap, and the underlying principle of a level playing field, and will continue to work transparently with Premiership Rugby in this regard."</p>
