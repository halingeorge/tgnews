      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/olivia-rodrigo/"><b>Olivia Rodrigo</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/dara-renee/"><b>Dara Renee</b></a> have opened up about their auditions for <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/high-school-musical/"><b><i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</i></b></a> in a brand new interview.</p>
      <p>The two stars, who play BFFs Nini and Kourtney on the Disney+ series, sat down with Collider along with <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/joshua-bassett/"><b>Joshua Bassett</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/larry-saperstein/"><b>Larry Saperstein</b></a> to chat about the audition process for the show.</p>
      <p>Turns out that<b> Dara</b>‘s Kourtney was only supposed to be in one episode!</p>
      <p>“I auditioned for every other role, except for my own,” <b>Dara </b>shared. “They were like, We don’t know what’s really popping for her.’ They made me read Kourtney, who was only supposed to be in one episode, but I put a little twist on it and they were like, ‘You know what? You might be a series regular.’”</p>
      <p><b>Olivia </b>added to her story, “She’s being humble. She was so amazing that they had to put her in every episode.”</p>
      <p><b>Olivia </b>also spoke about her audition with <b>Joshua</b>, <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2018/10/17/high-school-musical-the-musical-tv-series-casts-joshua-bassett-as-ricky/">who plays Ricky</a>.</p>
      <p>After first being “apprehensive” about the series, <b>Olivia </b>“went in and I read with Joshua, and we pulled together a little song. We sang ‘Count on Me,’ by Bruno Mars, really quickly.”</p>
      <p><b>Joshua </b>adds that they had “two minutes to figure it out. I stole a guitar from another girl auditioning for Nini, we figured out the harmonies, and then just went in the room and did it.”</p>
      <p>“The audition was really magical,” <b>Olivia</b> says. “Then, I got the call about a week later. It was a great audition.”</p>
      <p><i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</i> is streaming now on Disney+.</p>
