      <h1>Georgia photographer suffers concussion from hit on sideline of Auburn game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:36:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:36</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>A Georgia photographer briefly lost consciousness after she was hit on the sideline of Jordan-Hare Stadium during Saturday's game between Auburn and Georgia.</p>
      <p>Chamberlain Smith was unresponsive for a few moments following a <a href="http://twitter.com/cjzero/status/1195829641715605506">hit by Bulldogs running back Brian Herrien</a>; she eventually opened her eyes and responded to emergency personnel before being placed on a stretcher and removed from the field. Smith was discharged from a local hospital later Saturday night, The Athletic's Seth Emerson <a href="https://twitter.com/SethWEmerson/status/1195887189835558918">reported</a>, and Smith tweeted Sunday morning her injuries were "nothing more than a concussion and some bruises."</p>

      <p>Herrien appeared to try to jump over Smith, who was kneeling on the ground shooting the action, but his knee crashed into Smith and her camera, knocking her to the ground.</p>
