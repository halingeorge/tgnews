        <b>After the internet made a mockery of Google Stadia’s original measly lineup of launch titles, Google will be upping the number of launch-day games. </b>
      </p>
      <p>With Stadia officially launching tomorrow, this last-minute change of plans certainly comes as a surprise. <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-stadia-launch-lineup-only-has-12-games/">Instead of launching with just twelve titles</a>, Stadia will be launching with 22.</p>
      <p>The increased number of titles also sees an increase in titles granted for Stadia Pro subscribers. Instead of just giving players a copy of Destiny 2: The Collection, players can also grab the SNK fighting game Samurai Shodown. However, Stadia Pro is currently the only way to use Google Stadia.</p>
      <p>Stadia’s updated list of launch day games does include some solid games. Rage 2 and Wolfenstein: Youngblood stand out as interesting titles to experience through a streaming format.</p>
      <p>The updated list is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-stadias-big-exclusive-gylt-may-not-actually-be-exclusive/">GYLT</a>
        </li>
        <li>Just Dance 2020</li>
        <li>Kine</li>
        <li>Mortal Kombat 11</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Thumper</li>
        <li>Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Rise of theTomb Raider</li>
        <li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Samurai Shodown</li>
        <li>Attack on Titan 2: Final Battle</li>
        <li>Farming Simulator 19</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 15</li>
        <li>Football Manager 2020</li>
        <li>Grid (<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/grid-on-google-stadia-has-exclusive-40-player-mode-not-possible-anywhere-else/">with exclusive mode</a>)</li>
        <li>Metro Exodus</li>
        <li>NBA 2K20</li>
        <li>Rage 2</li>
        <li>Trials Rising</li>
        <li>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, instead of launching with twelve games (with ten you might already own), Stadia will have twenty two (twenty of which you might already own). It’s not a huge difference, but it’s good to have more games.</p>
