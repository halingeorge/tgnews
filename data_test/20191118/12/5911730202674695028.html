      <p>Five Below, a popular store focusing on products for $5 and under, is undergoing a colossal change: Its price point is going up for the first time in 17 years.</p>
      <p>No longer will the store, a bargain hunter's dream, only sell items priced at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/business/dollar-general-opposition/index.html">$5 and under</a> . Now, the store will be raising prices on certain items -- including tech products and certain toys and games.</p>
      <p>"We've always done everything possible to absorb cost increases," the company said <a href="https://www.fivebelow.com/explanation?utm_source=twit&amp;utm_medium=socm&amp;utm_campaign=5Bexplanation">in a statement</a> . "Recently, we had to raise prices above $5 on tech items to keep providing the products you love."</p>
      <p>For the toys and games priced up to $10, the company will keep them in a separate area of the store, called "Ten Below Gift Shop." For electronics, Five Below is adding a section called "Ten Below Tech."</p>
      <p>But the name "Five Below" is one thing that's not changing. The store -- known for selling everything <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/business/dollar-general-believe-beauty-cosmetics/index.html">from makeup</a> and clothes to candy -- will be keeping its original name despite the change.</p>
      <p>Most of the store's merchandise remains at $5 and below, according to the company.</p>
