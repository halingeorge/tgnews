      <p>Cape Town - The <b>Premier Soccer League (PSL)</b> chairman <b>Irvin Khoza</b> believes there is reason for optimism in South African football as he aims to improve the <b>Absa Premiership</b> and <b>Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC)</b>.</p>
      <p>It was revealed last week that a <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/psl-declare-historic-r1-billion-in-revenue-20191114">record R1 billion in revenue</a> was made from the 2018/19 season, and Khoza believes it bodes well for Mzansi's two professional leagues.</p>
      <p>Monthly grants awarded to the Premiership and MDC currently stand at R2 million and R500 000 respectively, but that is expected to increase from next season.</p>
      <p>"The important thing now, after reaching a record R1 billion in our income, it augurs well for our clubs in the new season," said Khoza, according to <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/news/articles/south-africa-news/categories/news/premiership/how-32-clubs-will-benefit-from-psl-s-record-r1-billion-revenue/667656">KickOff</a>.</p>
      <p>"It means it will bring about a new increase on the grants, apart from what has been given to them this season, which was also remarkable.</p>
      <p>"So, we're on a sound footing in terms of the governance of the league, and also the issues around the Multichoice Diski Challenge - there's a good story developing for the future of this league."</p>
