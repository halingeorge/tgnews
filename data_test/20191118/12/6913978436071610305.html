      <p><b>TBILISI -</b> The United States and European Union expressed solidarity Monday with Georgia's anti-government protesters who took to the streets after the ruling party backtracked on promises of electoral reforms.<br/><br/>In the biggest anti-government protest in years, more than 20,000 demonstrators rallied on Sunday outside the parliament building in the capital Tbilisi urging the government to resign and calling for new legislative elections.<br/><br/>In a joint statement, the US and EU embassies said they "recognize the deep disappointment of a wide segment of Georgian society at the failure of parliament to pass the constitutional amendments required to move to fully proportional parliamentary elections in 2020."<br/><br/>"We fully support the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression," the missions said.<br/><br/>The rally dispersed peacefully on Sunday night but entrances to the parliament building remain blocked by dozens of protesters who say no lawmakers will be allowed to pass through.<br/><br/>At an earlier protest on Thursday, some 10,000 people rallied in Tbilisi, vowing to press ahead with "permanent" protests until their demands for snap polls are met.<br/><br/>Opposition parties called for the rallies after forming a rare united front against the ruling Georgian Dream party, whose MPs last week voted down legislation to hold parliamentary elections next year under a new proportional voting system.<br/><br/>The opposition accused powerful oligarch and Georgian Dream leader Bidzina Ivanishvili -- who is widely believed to be the man in charge in Georgia -- of being behind the move.<br/><br/>The US and EU embassies said the failure to pass the legislation "has increased mistrust and heightened tensions between the ruling party and other political parties and civil society."<br/><br/>Protesters say the ruling party unfairly benefits from the current voting system.<br/><br/>The Georgian Dream won nearly 77 percent of seats in the 2016 parliamentary election despite garnering only 48.7 percent of the vote.<br/><br/>Opposition parties at the time denounced the polls as rigged.<br/><br/>In power since 2012, the ruling party has seen its popularity plummet amid widespread discontent over economic stagnation and perceived backsliding on its commitment to democracy.<br/><br/>Critics have accused Ivanishvili of persecuting political opponents, suffocating critical media, and creating a corrupt political system where his private interests dominate government decision-making. -AFP</p>
