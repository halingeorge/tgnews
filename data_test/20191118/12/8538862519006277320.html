      <p><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a> has had a pretty rough ride since its arrival in 2016. The slim content at launch has slowly been added to over the years, with the <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v_arcade_edition">Arcade Edition</a> re-release an attempt to make amends for the shaky start. Now, though, it seems Capcom is ready to bring everything together in one complete package. Street Fighter V: Champion Edition was announced over the weekend, and it includes pretty much everything.</p>

      <p>This version of the game, which releases on 14th February 2020, will house 40 characters (including the newly revealed Gill), 34 stages, and over 200 costumes for all your favourite combatants. You're also getting new V-Skills for each character, and pre-ordering the game will get you a static theme and even more outfits. The standalone game will cost $30, but owners of any previous version of Street Fighter V can purchase an Upgrade Pack for $25. This will give you "instant access to all available Champion Edition content as it becomes available leading up to the launch date".</p>
