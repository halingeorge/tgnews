      <h1>Australian PM slams "insensitive" Israel Folau over homophobic bushfire comments</h1>
      <h2>Former rugby star Israel Folau blamed Australia's same-sex marriage laws for the recent bushfires which have killed six people in the country</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:42:47+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:42</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has branded Israel Folau's homophobic bushfire comments as "appallingly insensitive".</p>
      <p>Former rugby star Folau claimed that the recent fires which have swept across Australia, and killed six people, were caused by the nation voting to legalise same-sex marriages.</p>
      <p>Folau is a devote Christian who had his Rugby Australia contract ripped up for anti-gay hate speech on social media.</p>
      <p>Morrison said the comments were "appallingly insensitive" and would have offended "many Christians in Australia for whom that is not their view at all, and whose thoughts and prayers ... are very much with those who are suffering under the terrible burden of fire."</p>

      <p>He added: "He’s a free citizen, he can say whatever he likes, but that doesn’t mean he can’t have regard to the grievous offence this would have caused to people whose homes have been burnt down."</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old read out his hateful sermon in Sydney on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the footage, that was posted to The Truth of Jesus Christ Church's  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>  page, Folau said: "They've legalised same-sex marriage... Going against the laws that God says.</p>

      <p>"Abortion – it's OK now to murder and kill infants, unborn children - and they deem that to be OK. </p>
      <p>"Look how rapid these bush fires, these droughts, all these things they've come in a short period of time – you think it's a coincidence?</p>
      <p>"What you see out there in the world – it's only a little taste of what God's judgement is like. The news is saying these bushfires are the worst we’ve ever seen in Australia – they haven't seen anything," he added.</p>
      <p>"God is speaking to us. Speaking to you to repent and to turn away from this."</p>
      <p>Folau is currently suing Rugby Australia for unlawfully terminating his contract because of his religious beliefs and is seeking £5.3m ($10m) in damages.</p>
      <p>He most recently played for New South Wales Warratahs in Super Rugby.</p>
      <p>Folau was also stood down from the club side after the homophobic social media post, where he stated those in same sex relationships would go to hell "unless they repent their sins".</p>
