      <p><a href="https://talksport.com/topic/sports-breakfast/">Tim Sherwood has told Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show on TalkSPORT</a> (Monday, 9:15am) that he believes Tottenham Hotspur will record an away win over London rivals West Ham United on Saturday at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Tottenham take the short trip to Stratford to take on Manuel Pellegrini’s struggling side, with both clubs in desperate need of a win. Tottenham sit in 14th place despite having pre-season expectations of a title challenge alongside Liverpool and Man City.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, West Ham were expected to challenge for a place in the top six after spending big in the summer once again. However, the Hammers have managed just three wins in the league – and sit in a lowly 16th place.</p>
      <p>Both sides’ poor form adds plenty more spice to Saturday’s Premier League fixture and ex-Tottenham manager Sherwood reckons Spurs will taste league victory for just the fourth time this season – with a 2-1 win over the Hammers.</p>
      <p>“It is a massive game for both clubs and both sets of fans. Both desperately need a win, but I think Spurs might nick a 2-1 win,” <a href="https://talksport.com/topic/sports-breakfast/">Sherwood said.</a></p>

      <p>Michail Antonio scored the only goal of the game against Tottenham last time out, as West Ham beat Spurs 1-0 away from home. But that is West Ham’s only win in the last four meetings between the sides.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini will be without Lukasz Fabianski and Manuel Lanzini, but doubts remain over Jack Wilshere, Mark Noble and Antonio. Tottenham are without Hugo Lloris, while Erik Lamela and Jan Vertonghen are doubts.</p>
