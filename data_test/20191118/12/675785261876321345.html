      <p>A teacher was outed as a sex pest after a student filmed him taking upskirt footage of female pupils during class time.</p>
      <p>Footage shows the moment the vile teacher places a mobile phone at the hem of a skirt and points it up between a teen's legs at a school in Ecuador.</p>
      <p>Ecuador’s Ministry of Education has confirmed a teacher, who has not been named, has been suspended from a school in the city of Quevedo for sexual harassment.</p>
      <p>The teacher was suspended after videos, assumed to have been filmed by the students, went viral online, local media La Republica reported.</p>

      <p>In it, the teacher is seen preparing his mobile phone and dropping his arm down by the side of his chair as the student approaches.</p>
      <p>He then edges the mobile closer to the girl’s legs and directs it upwards, as she turns the pages of the workbook for him to see.</p>
      <p>The video has racked up more than ten thousand views on YouTube, outraging social media users.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the video, one person criticised the Department of Education’s hiring process of teachers, calling for tougher measures to ensure candidates are vetted more thoroughly.</p>
      <p>Another person, “disgusted” by the video, slammed the teacher’s actions, raising concerns over his mental health and the impact on pupils.</p>

      <p>The Ministry of Education has launched an investigation into the incident and will provide counselling to affected students, it announced in a statement on November 14.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors are reportedly analysing the case though no criminal complaints have been made against the teacher, according to CEN.</p>
      <p>This is the latest offence in a string of teacher-pupil related sexual incidents in the country.</p>
      <p>Between 2018 and 2019, the Ministry of Education of Los Rios suspended nine teachers for being involved in cases of abuse and sexual violence.</p>
