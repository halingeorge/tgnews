      <p>In 2008, a  boy in the streets of Harare was spotted in delight as he carried huge amounts of cash in bundles of 200 000 Zimbabwean Bearers’ Cheque Dollars in a sign of Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation.</p>
      <p>The picture went viral all over the world during Doctor Gideon Gono’s days at RBZ and has since been one of the iconic images in social media displaying vividly the economic turmoil that was and is still plaguing the entire country.</p>
      <p>A recent picture of the same, but now-grown unidentified boy has emerged showing him eleven years later-smartly dressed and healthier.</p>
