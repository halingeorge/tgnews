      <p>This is the scene inside a Paisley flat that a drugs gang transformed into a £40,000 cannabis factory.</p>
      <p>The sophisticated set-up, which includes a full lighting and ventilation system, was operating in a Walker Street flat, in the town’s west end.</p>
      <p>Police only uncovered the 60-plant cultivation after complaints about the stench coming from the residential building.</p>
      <p>An investigation is now under way to identify who is behind the farm and the plants and kit have been removed.</p>
      <p>If sold on the street, police say dealers could have made as much as £40,000 from a single crop.</p>
      <p>Inspector Tracy Harkins, from Paisley’s community policing team, urged members of the public to alert cops to suspicious activity in their community so they can investigate.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “Officers searched a property in Walker Street, Paisley, under warrant on Thursday after a strong smell was reported.</p>
      <p>“A large cannabis cultivation of more than 60 plants was located within along with associated equipment.</p>
      <p>“The drugs have an approximate street value of around £40,000.</p>
      <p>“Our enquiries to identify the owner of the plants is ongoing and we would urge anyone with information in relation to this find to get in touch.”</p>
      <p>She added: “If you have any suspicions at all in relation to drug dealing or growing in you community, please contact police.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“This could include a strong smell of cannabis, windows being covered, and people coming and going at strange times of the day.</p>
      <p>“We will investigate all reports fully.</p>
      <p>“Dealing or growing drugs has absolutely no place in our community and will simply not be tolerated.”</p>
      <p>Call police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.</p>
