      <p>With 52,000 flocking to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James’ Park</a> to see their heroes pull on the Black and White shirts, former Newcastle United striker Gavin Peacock believes having players who understand the supporters’ desire to see hard work on the pitch pays off.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to explain,” admits Peacock about the unique bond between players and fans. He believes some players who came after his era struggled to build a similar bond.</p>
      <p>“I think some players now who have played for Newcastle, maybe big money players, they have a couple of years and then they go. I don’t think they have the same rapport with the fans that we had.”</p>
      <p>Peacock was just 23 when he was told of Newcastle’s interest, then managed by Jim Smith, but with his grandparents from South Shields, he had known all about the history.</p>
      <p>“We were on the training field, I was at Bournemouth and Harry Redknapp is in charge. He’s on the phone and often when Harry’s on the phone, he can be placing a bet on the dogs or the horses; but this time he’s been speaking to Newcastle.</p>
      <p>“He pulls me aside and says ‘Gav, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> have come in for you. Are you interested in going? There’s a swap deal with Wayne Fereday on the table and some money.’</p>
      <p>“I knew that was the move. I went home and chatted to my wife, we had just been married a year; just bought our first little house in Bournemouth and I said ‘darling, Newcastle United have come in for me and I think we’re going to go.’</p>
      <p>“She just burst into tears - and said ‘where is Newcastle?’</p>
      <p>“I said it’s north and it’s very very cold but it’s a big club and a big opportunity. So we came up, she loved it here. We lived in Durham and it was just little things like Press men met me at the airport, I wasn’t getting that at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>“Newcastle hadn’t taken off at this stage. They were mid-table in the old second division. Roy Aitken was captain and give me a tour of the stadium. He said: ‘Get here. Sign the contract.’</p>
      <p>“I was still doing the negotiations and he told me ‘if this place takes off - it’ll be electric.’</p>
      <p>“My grandad used to tell me stories about when he used to go down as a kid. And then when I came here my Grandad said: ‘The fan’s here are special. If they see that you are willing to sweat blood for their team, they’ll forgive you lots of mistakes you’ll make’ and I remembered that.</p>
      <p>“I just thought, they would if they could get that Black and White shirt on, they would sweat blood for Newcastle, so it’s the least I could do.”</p>
      <p>Peacock scored 16 goals as United avoided relegation on the final day of the season. He then netted a further 12 league goals the season after as the Magpies were promoted to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>And for the now 49-year-old he believes the ethos that the team had of what football means to the Tyneside public was key having returned to Newcastle for the first time in many years.</p>
      <p>“It makes it feel like coming home. Like family. That’s what football is about. Players playing for the team that belongs to the fans. And when I was here, we’d do a social event as players and someone said to me:‘Gavin, you don’t understand what it means to us as fans to watch you play on a Saturday. Some of our lives are hard, they’re tough. It’s the pinnacle of our week, it lifts us, people will come and watch, they’ll go out if we win and stay in if we don’t.</p>
      <p>“And it has an affect on the whole of the city. I got that.”</p>
