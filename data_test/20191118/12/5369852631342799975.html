      <p>EVERTON PASSED UP the chance to sign Erling Haaland, Andy Robertson and Harry Maguire, the club’s former director of football, Steve Walsh, has revealed.</p>

      <p>Questions have been asked of the Toffees’ recruitment business in recent times, with big money invested at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>Value has not been found in all of those deals, while some serious talent has been allowed to slip the net. Walsh, whose recruitment helped Leicester to a stunning Premier League title triumph back in 2015-16, was acquired to help bring the best talent to Merseyside at a reasonable price.</p>
      <p>He claims to have lined up several options that, in hindsight, would have been shrewd additions for Everton had agreements not been snubbed.</p>
      <p>Teenage sensation Haaland is now wanted by leading sides across Europe after becoming a prolific presence for Red Bull Salzburg. Robertson and Maguire are star turns at Liverpool and Manchester United respectively, with the former considered to be a world-class left-back and the latter the most expensive defender on the planet after making an £80 million switch to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Walsh says he could have taken both to Everton for a fraction of that price during their days at Hull City, with a man who severed ties with the Toffees in 2018 telling <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">The Athletic</a>:</p>
      <p>“While I was at Everton, I offered them Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire deals, when they were at Hull, and it was worth £20 million for the pair.</p>
      <blockquote>Everton wouldn’t take them. “I had a deal done for Jonny Evans too before he came to Leicester, but again they wouldn’t take him.</blockquote>
      <p>“Erling Haaland, the striker with Salzburg, I had him and his dad at the club with a deal done for €4 million. The club wouldn’t back me.”</p>

      <p>Everton will now be cursing those transfer calls, with the Toffees left to reflect on what could have been.</p>
      <p>Those that have been drafted into their squad have only been able to collect 14 points from 12 Premier League games in 2019-20, with that return leaving Marco Silva’s side perched just three places and six points above the relegation zone.</p>
