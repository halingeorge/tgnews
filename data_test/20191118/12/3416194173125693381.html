      <h1>Big Machine's New Statement About AMAs Was Not Approved by Dick Clark Productions</h1>

      <p>The plot is thickening in the drama between <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/taylor-swift/"><b>Taylor Swift</b></a> and Big Machine Label Group as we inch closer and closer to the <i><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/2019-american-music-awards/"><b>American Music Awards</b></a></i>, where Tay is being honored with the Artist of the Decade Award.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old singer said last week that her former label was blocking her from performing her old music at the AMAs on November 24.</p>
      <p>After several days of claims being made from both sides of the feud, Big Machine <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2019/11/18/taylor-swift-amas-performance-has-been-approved-by-big-machine/">released what was believed to be a joint statement</a> between them and Dick Clark Productions. The statement noted, “The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms.”</p>
      <p>Now, the production company behind the AMAs says they have nothing to do with this statement.</p>

      </p>
      <p>A rep for Dick Clark Productions then told <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/taylor-swift-big-machine-reach-deal-amas-performance-1255740?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_now_2019-11-18%2013:25:19_HLewis&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews">THR</a></i>, “At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding <b>Taylor Swift</b>’s performance at the <i>2019 American Music Awards</i>. Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with <b>Taylor Swift</b>’s management team. We have no further comment.”</p>
      <p>Big Machine’s statement has now been changed tot he following: “The Big Machine Label Group informed Dick Clark Productions today that they have agreed to grant all licenses of their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms.”</p>
      <p>Neither of Big Machine’s statements actually mention <b>Taylor Swift</b> by name.</p>
