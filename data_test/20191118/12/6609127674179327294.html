      <p>The bartender, from Kirkcaldy, said he was punched on the head and face 30 times in the unprovoked assault after the gang yanked open his car door.</p>
      <p>But the top of his ear was completely ripped off when one of his attackers grabbed hold of his bar-style earring and "just pulled".</p>
      <p>He rushed to the town's Victoria Hospital after the horror 10.30pm ordeal where medics reattached the top of his ear.</p>
      <p>Cody said: “This lad grabbed hold of it and just pulled. He ripped the top of my ear right off.”</p>
      <p>“There was blood pouring everywhere."</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old managed to drive off after the attack, and called in cops.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/teenager-has-ear-sewn-back-together-after-being-attacked-in-fife-town/">Evening Telegraph</a>, he added: “I drove straight to Victoria Hospital where doctors gave me 11 stitches to put my ear back together.”</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said: “Enquiries are underway following the report of a serious assault in Kirkcaldy last night.</p>
      <p>“Around 10.20pm a 19-year-old man was assaulted while in his car.</p>
      <p>“He attended Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy where he was treated for a head injury."</p>
