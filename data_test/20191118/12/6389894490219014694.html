      <h1>Saudi Aramco bets on local demand as it cancels European IPO roadshow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:27:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Thicknesse</a></address>
      <p>Saudi Aramco this morning cancelled plans for its European roadshow for its long-delayed initial public offering (IPO), a day after doing the same for investor meetings in the US and Asia.</p>
      <p>The decision, which was reported by the Financial Times, means that shares will not be formally marketed outside of the Gulf.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Meetings will now only take place in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman. </p>
      <p>The success of the IPO will now depend on local demand, with 0.5 per cent of shares reserved for Saudi nationals, who will then get access to a bonus share scheme as long as they maintain their stock for a fixed period. </p>
      <p>On Sunday, Aramco, which is the world’s largest oil producer, released the official price range for the sale, which would value the company at $1.7 trillion.</p>
      <p>The kingdom’s leadership were told that this was still higher than foreign institutions were willing to pay, two people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times.</p>
      <p>In a statement the company said that it would sell 1.5 per cent of the company’s shares on Riyadh’s Tadawul exchange at a price of 30 to 32 riyals.</p>
      <p>At the top end of the price range a sale of this size would give the oil giant a value of $25.6bn, just surpassing the $25bn raised by Chinese retailer Alibaba in its debut in New York in 2014. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Although this would make the IPO the largest of all time, it falls well short of initial plans, which would have seen the company sell a reported 5 per cent of shares, raising nearly $100bn in the process.</p>
      <p>The sale is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to diversify the gulf state’s economy away from oil.</p>
      <p>Saudi Aramco declined to comment at this stage.</p>
