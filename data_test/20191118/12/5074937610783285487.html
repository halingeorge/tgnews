      <p>Wenchi (Bono), Nov. 18, GNA - A Physiotherapy Healthcare Centre, built by a Germany-based Ghanaian non-governmental organization (NGO), Landshut, at the cost of 200,000 Euros for the Methodist Hospital at Wenchi, Bono Region, has been inaugurated.</p>
      <p>The centre, fully stocked with healthcare delivery equipment, is made up of an Out Patient Department, Consulting room, Pediatric room, an electrotherapy room, a massage parlour and a gymnasium.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kwame Abrefa-Busia, President, Landshut, handing over the Centre to the Hospital’s Management, said one of the NGO’s cardinal objectives was to assist the Ghana Health Service to deliver quality healthcare services to the citizenry.</p>
      <p>He said 75 per cent of the cost was absorbed by the German government with 15 per cent support from the Hospital while the remaining 10 per cent was contributions by the members of the Organisation.</p>
      <p>Mr. Abrefa-Busia said the support for the Hospital was necessary because the country needed more physiotherapy centres to provide easy access to such services, adding that the Centre would cater for not only people  in the Wenchi Municipality but those in the nearby Districts and the entire Region.</p>
      <p>"As citizens, we must not always depend on government to do everything for us, because national development is a collective responsibility.</p>
      <p> “We can also contribute to national progress by supporting the government, either in cash or kind for the provision of facilities like the Centre,” he advised.</p>
      <p>Most Reverend Dr. Paul Kwabena Boafo, Presiding Bishop, Methodist Church Ghana, said individual’s contributions to the development of society was very necessary because the measurement of one’s life was based on contributions and impacts made to the community.</p>
      <p>He entreated the staff of the Hospital to "rededicate themselves" to offer the maximum healthcare delivery services for the maximum satisfaction of the general public.</p>
      <p>"Offer yourself as a living sacrifice, so that God will give you much wisdom to deliver in the provision of health care to the country," he stressed.</p>
      <p>Most Rev. Dr.  Boafo appealed to the Hospital’s management to ensure regular maintenance of the Centre to enhance its longevity.</p>
      <p>Rev.  Bernard Clement Kwasi Botwe, Chief Executive Officer, Wenchi Methodist Hospital, later in an interview, assured that a team of experts would always be available to provide repair services.</p>
