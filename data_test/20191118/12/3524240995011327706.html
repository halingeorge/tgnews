      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has said that Kogi State Governor, Mr Yahaya Bello, ran a good race in the November 16 governorship poll and won it well.</p>
      <p>This was contained in his message of congratulations to Bello, who was declared the winner of the poll by the Independent National Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p>“The President describes the election and emergence of the All Progressives Congress candidate as ‘a race well run and a victory well won.’</p>
      <p>“He commends APC supporters for remaining steadfast and resolute even in the face of isolated incidents of violence”, a State House statement by his media aide, Mr Femi Adesina, on Monday said.</p>
      <p>He also condoled with families who lost loved ones during the election.</p>
      <p>“All political actors and stakeholders must take deliberate steps to eschew electoral violence as a peaceful and orderly process are vital to our quest for enduring democracy”, the President said.</p>
      <p>The statement added, “He salutes officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies for creditably discharging their responsibilities under difficult conditions.</p>
      <p>“President Buhari urges Governor Bello to see his renewed mandate as another opportunity to build on the foundations already laid towards improving the lives of the people of Kogi State.</p>
      <p>“He also enjoins the governor to imbibe the spirit of magnanimity in victory by extending a hand of partnership to opposition candidates, while urging those dissatisfied with the outcome of the election to approach the courts.”</p>
