      <h1>Wales Wants to Let 16-Year-Olds Vote</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:40:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Cutlack</a></address>
      <p>The miniature little heritage government they let Wales have is starting a push to give 16-year-olds the right to vote, although it won't usher in a new era of Cardiff-rule for the rest of the United Kingdom as it'll only apply to the poorly-attended democracy fests that are the regional council elections.</p>
      <p>The new Bill would see each Welsh local council allowed to approve or veto the move, while also introducing the slightly different electoral option of the single transferable vote, which is a modern take on the old proportional representation system that some politicians have long been banging on about the UK needing to adopt.</p>
      <p>One interesting additional change in the laws would see Welsh voters automatically added to the electoral register when they come of age too, which would nicely kill today's pious trend for celebrities to endlessly remind us proles of the need to register to vote. [<a href="https://gov.wales/new-law-introduce-votes-16-and-17-year-olds-local-council-elections-wales-unveiled">GOV</a> via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/18/welsh-bill-would-allow-16--and-17-year-olds-to-vote-in-local-elections">Guardian</a>]</p>
