          </p>
          <p>Leading Group B of the marquee T10 League, when Team Abu Dhabi step out in the middle today for their culminating group stage clash, the side know that anything else than a win will prove to be disastrous for them. Elsewhere, with a win asserting them of not only a place in the semi-finals but also a place in the pinnacles of the group, the ramifications stemming from the tie are enough to buoy the side ahead of their culminating group stage clash contest.</p>
          <p>The side are entering the fray of today’s crucial encounter having won their previous match by 6 wickets as they chased down the meagre target of 93 set infront of them with 9 balls to spare. It took them to three points after they had previously drawn their league opener, putting them in an extremely position ahead of ther impending encounter against Maratha Arabians today.</p>

                <p>Their opponents meanwhile themselves have immense momentum in ther kitty after having cruised to a comprehensive 47 run win against Qalandars the last time around, one which did a massive favour to their net run-rate as well. Piling on 107 while batting first, the side ended up making a mockery of their opponent’s run chase, one which saw them cut short their work to send them back to the pavilion for a mere 60 runs.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>An extremely fine wicket for bating, this is a surface which will retain its shape and identity across the full course of the 20 overs to see the side winning the toss opting to step out and field first. There is extremely little on this ground for the bowlers with the only way to limit the batters being to bowl widish deliveries and force the batters to hit over the square boundaries.</p>

                            <h3>TAB Vs MAR Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>We begin with Team Abu Dhabi’s opener and wicket-keeper Niroshan Dickwella for this encounter. Although he’s yet to revel us in massive knocks, the player comes out to open for his side, seeing his spot in the batting order make him a solid choice for today’s impending contest.</p>
                            <p>We are getting the opposition’s wicket-keeper as well with Chadwick Walton being an integral component of his side’s batting unit given the way the player has come out and opened his arms with ease to amass a bagful of runs.</p>
                            <h3>TAB Vs MAR Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>This has been a horrid time for Maratha Arabians; opener Chris Lynn but the skill set the bat comes imbued with in his kitty means we can’t keep him out for this encounter. The T10 format s one where he can get going any time and we envision him scoring some good runs today to see us nail down the player in our side’s docket.</p>
                            <p>His counterpart Adam Lyth got the 21 runs in 11 balls the last time around to see him be nailed down in our setup as well while from the other side we are making ther opener Luke Wright a regulation pick after he raked up the 48 runs in a meagre 23 balls the last time around.</p>
                            <h3>TAB Vs MAR Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>We begin with Moeen Ali with the all-rounder coming out to open for his side, a position which is more than enough to warrant his selection. He will be accompanied by Lewis Gregory for the day with the player begin a crucial part of his side’s docket whilst from the other side of the segment we are opting for James Fuller after he sent down the one over for a mere three runs the last time around for Maratha Arabians.</p>
                            <h3>TAB Vs MAR Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>In what was a complete all round performance by Mitchell McCleneghan in the previous encounter, one which saw the player pick up 2-9 with the ball and score 20 runs down the lower middle-order, the cricketer ended up marauding his side to a compelling win on the day. It was a rousing and succulent display by the player, a performance which makes him an instant pick for the day while from Team Abu Dhabi we are choosing the two players for this department.</p>
                            <p>Both Harry Gurney and Marchant de Lange sent down wicket to wicket spells the last time around, curbing and halting batters from peeling them off with ease, players we envisage putting in a resounding showing today as well.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to make Luke Wright our side’s captain for the encounter while Moeen is the vice-captain.</p>
