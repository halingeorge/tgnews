      <h1>College football bowl projections Week 13: One-loss teams fight for last Playoff spot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:35:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Bender</a></address>
      <p>Sporting News' Week 13 bowl projections are here in time for the third set of College Football Playoff rankings, which will be unveiled on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Sporting News' Playoff picture has not changed despite the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/tua-tagovailoa-injury-update-full-recovery-alabama/180j74l0ucrnf15c15n6plvm81">season-ending injury</a> to Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, but the scramble among the one-loss teams for that final Playoff spot is too close to call. We have unbeaten teams Ohio State and Clemson in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal, and undefeated LSU is still in the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl semifinal.</p>
      <p>Which one-loss team do we have playing the Tigers? For now, it's still Oregon ahead of Georgia, Oklahoma and Alabama. There are three weeks left to figure it out, and anything can happen with those teams.</p>
