      <h1>Tata Steel to cut 3,000 European jobs due to excess supply, high costs</h1>
      <h2>The company says there will be no plant closures; the aim is to ensure long-term future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:27:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tata-steel">Tata Steel </a>plans to cut around 3,000 jobs across its European operations as it wrestles with excess supply, a source close to the discussions told Reuters on Monday.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the group's European chief executive Henrik Adam said Tata was planning to announce <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/job-cuts">job cuts </a>across the European business, which employs around 20,000 people, but did not give figures on job losses.</p>
      <p>Following a meeting of Dutch employees, a source told Reuters around 3,000 jobs would go and details would be worked out over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>A Tata spokesman had no immediate comment on the number.</p>
      <p>Indian-owned Tata Steel, which launched a transformation programme in June to strengthen its European business, has operations including steelmaking in the Netherlands and Wales and downstream operations across Europe.</p>
      <p>There will be no plant closures but the aim is to shield the company against the "huge number of challenges" it faces, Tata said.</p>
      <p>"We are working hard on our plans to be operationally cash positive," Adam said.</p>
      <p>A company spokesman confirmed Adam's comments originally made to the Financial Times newspaper.</p>
      <p>Steel making in Europe has come under strain from international competition and high energy costs, putting large numbers of well-paid jobs under threat.</p>
      <p>European steelmakers blame China for the extent of a surplus in the market, but the world's biggest steelmaker says it has made its own deep cuts to capacity.</p>
      <p>Britain last week said Chinese steelmaker Jingye has signed a provisional deal to buy British Steel, which went into compulsory liquidation in May.</p>

      <p>The agreement is politically resonant ahead of British elections as job opportunities have become a major issue. If confirmed, the rescue could save thousands of jobs.</p>
      <p>ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest steelmaker, has idled a series of plants across Europe.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tata-steel">Tata Steel </a>said on Monday challenging market conditions had been made "worse by the use of Europe as a dumping ground for the world's excess capacity".</p>
      <p>The company's European transformation programme launched in June aimed to develop "a simpler and leaner organisation, capable of sustainably financing high levels of investment, Tata said.</p>
      <p>Changes will include streamlining supply chains and using technology to improve efficiency, as well as seeking to cut employment costs.</p>
      <p>Tata's quest to boost profitability follows a European anti-trust decision to block a joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp.</p>
      <p>Eurofer, which represents the European steel industry, said in an email job losses were "a worrying and upsetting trend" caused by global overcapacity and hesitant demand.</p>
      <p>It urged EU policy makers "to help stabilise the EU market by warding off import surges and supporting vital steel sector workers during this challenging period".</p>
