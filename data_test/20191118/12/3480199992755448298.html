      <p>West Mercia's Police and Crime Commissioner, John Campion, is now calling for more to be done to tackle assaults against emergency workers.</p>
      <p>West Mercia Police said they have seen a seven per cent increase in incidents where the victim was an officer or member of staff.</p>
      <p>In total 180 incidents, of which 53 involved injury, were reported in just three months.</p>
      <p>The force said that 17 per cent of the victims were repeat victims, with five frontline officers, being a victim four times or more, in just a sixth month period.</p>
      <p>New legislation was brought in last year, giving the courts the power to impose stronger sentences, and in the year since 259 charges or summons have been brought.</p>
      <p>Commissioner John Campion said: “Through my Behind the Badge campaign, we are seeing progress; sentences are becoming tougher for those who assault emergency workers or animals and my investments in body worn video acts as a deterrent, but there is so much more we, as a society as a whole, can do.</p>
      <p>"We are seeing around two incidents every day, and this is just not acceptable. We need to look at the bigger picture, where alcohol and drugs play a part, and make rehabilitation programmes effective. By tackling these underlying problems, we can do more for our communities, and for our hard working emergency workers.”</p>
