      <h1>Manny Pacquiao sets comeback date as Amir Khan states he still wants fight</h1>
      <h2>Manny Pacquiao is plotting his return to the ring - and the dates could fit in with a chance to finally fight British superstar Amir Khan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:09:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:09</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manny Pacquiao has his eyes set on a return to the ring in March or April 2020 - with Amir Khan still keen on being his opponent.</p>
      <p>Pacquiao outpointed the previously unbeaten Keith Thurman with a vintage display in July before turning his attentions back to his political duties in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>With the Senate in recess between March 14 and May 3, Pacquiao is targeting his next fight, with MP Promotions chief Sean Gibbons confirmed he is expected to fight "in the first quarter" of 2020.</p>
      <p>Pacquiao has now spoken out on his plans, telling the Manila Bulletin: “I can fight in March, April because the Senate will be on break during that time."</p>

      <p>Before his fight with Thurman, Pacquiao was tipped to take on British star Amir Khan, who claimed a super fight between the pair had already been agreed.</p>
      <p>Khan later backtracked on those claims, stating he had been wrongly informed contracts were signed by his team.</p>
      <p>But he revealed in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6wUzO801go">IFL TV</a> that he is targeting a huge name such as Pacquiao or Mayweather, with a long-touted showdown with British rival Kell Brook his plan B.</p>

      <p>“Manny Pacquiao or [Floyd] Mayweather or someone big like that,” said Khan to IFL TV when asked who he wants to fight in 2020. “I want to be back out in March next year. A few fights we’re looking at. The Kell Brook fight.”</p>
      <p>Khan, who last fought against Billy Dib in Saudi Arabia earlier this year, stated he does not see Mayweather coming out of retirement to fight again.</p>

      <p>And timings with his planned return in March fit in with Pacquiao's schedule, which could mean it is in contention to happen.</p>
      <p>Other potential opponents for Pacquiao include Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia, Shawn Porter and several others.</p>
      <p>Errol Spence, the IBF and WBC king, was tipped for a unification bout with WBA champion Pacquiao but his recovery form a serious car accident could rule the fight out.</p>
