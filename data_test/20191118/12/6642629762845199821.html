      <p><b>London, United Kingdom -</b> The protest group Extinction Rebellion launched a hunger strike on Monday aimed at building pressure on governments around the world to take action on the ecological <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/climate-sos.html">climate emergency</a>.</p>

      <p>In the UK, the protest comes ahead of a snap election, scheduled to take place on December 12. Following a two-week protest in London in October, activists plan to launch another series of disruptive actions ahead of the poll, in a bid to put the climate emergency on the agenda in a Brexit-dominated election.</p>
      <p>"A hunger strike is one of the things we can use that can't be taken away," Angus Rose, a 50-year-old software developer originally from South Africa, told Al Jazeera.</p>
      <p>Rose has taken time off work to take part in the hunger strike. "If someone is arrested, [that person] could still continue a hunger strike."</p>
      <p>The October protests led to more than 2,500 arrests globally, including <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/climate-change-extinction-rebellion-protesters-arrested-uk-190921162628620.html">at least 1,700</a> in the UK, where activists declared themselves willing to face arrest - mostly for <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/london-climate-protesters-defy-police-ban-191015160010632.html">breaching conditions</a> imposed by police under public order laws.</p>
      <p>Protesters blocked traffic in the capital by glueing themselves to roads near government departments, financial institutions and social media giants' headquarters, and also <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/climate-protests-london-airport-blockade-191010144737669.html">caused delays</a> at London City Airport.</p>
      <p>It led to a police ban on protests by the group; a ban which was declared unlawful by the UK's High Court a few weeks later.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion uses civil disobedience to raise awareness of the threat posed by human-induced <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/climate-change.html">global warming</a> on people around the world, particularly the most vulnerable, and of the loss of biodiversity.</p>
      <p>Last week, protesters in the UKÂ hand-delivered letters to the headquarters of the seven parties contesting the election, asking for a meeting with party leaders to discuss - on camera - the movement's demands, which they would like to see enshrined into law. These include setting a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, and setting up a citizens' assembly to lead decisions on climate change.</p>
      <p>While the Green Party and Labour plan to bring forward the net-zero emissions target to 2030, the Liberal Democrats have set it to 2045 and the Conservatives to 2050.</p>
      <p>Following Extinction Rebellion's protests in October, a cross-party group of MPs sent out 30,000 letters inviting citizens to take part in a citizens' assembly to advise on the climate crisis. Extinction Rebellion welcomed the move, but warned the government might just ignore the advice without any legal guarantees.</p>
      <p>"I teach at university, and I teach young people between 17 and 19. I prepare them for the future, and I know they don't have a future," Petra Metzger, a 37-year-old fashion and textiles lecturer at Central Saint Martins, told Al Jazeera.</p>
      <p>"With the elections coming up I think this is a very important moment where we need to bring this more to people's attention," said Metzger, who says she is willing to continue her hunger strike beyond a week, depending on the parties' responses.</p>
      <p>A recent Opinium poll found that the climate issue will influence a majority of British voters in the upcoming election, particularly the young ones. Ipsos Mori found <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-latest-environment-climate-change-policies-poll-pollution-jeremy-corbyn-labour-a9206571.html">21 percent</a> of voters mention the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/environment.html">environment</a> as one of the top issues facing the country - while only 2 percent did so unprompted in 2012.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the issue of climate change is barely on the radar of public opinion.</p>
      <p>"First of all, I'd ask the government not to ridicule the movement, to listen to what we are saying," Anita Sobiechowska, a 30-year-old musician from Warsaw who is one of a handful of hunger strikers in coal-reliant Poland, told Al Jazeera.</p>
      <p>"The Polish mainstream media are calling our demands absurd, they say we are exaggerating. We feel we are not being heard."</p>
