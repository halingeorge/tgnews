      <p>Cricket Australia (CA) has imposed a year-long ban, with nine months suspended, on Hobart Hurricanes player Emily Smith after she posted a team line-up on Instagram before its official release.</p>
      <p>Smith's post, which went up around an hour before it was permitted, was considered a breach of CA's anti-corruption code.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old displayed the team on the social media platform prior to a Women's Big Bash League fixture against Sydney Thunder on November 2, a match that was abandoned because of poor weather.</p>
      <p>The sanction has been accepted by Smith and the three-month suspension she will serve rules her out of the rest of the Women's Big Bash League and Women's National Cricket League.</p>

      <p>Sean Carroll, CA's head of integrity and security, said the governing body accepted there was no intent to breach the code but all players must be aware of their responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Carroll said via a CA statement: "Whilst Cricket Australia acknowledges that at the time of posting the team line-up there was no intent to breach the Anti-Corruption Code, CA's rigorous anti-corruption player education program means that players are well aware of their obligations under the Anti-Corruption Code and there is no excuse for breaches regardless of the reasons for information being disclosed.</p>
      <p>"Since the commencement of the WBBL, Cricket Australia has had in place a robust anti-corruption program.</p>
      <p>"We have been working with Emily throughout the process and Emily now understands the mistake she made.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, in this instance Emily's actions breached the Anti-Corruption Code. We hope this serves as reminder to all that the Anti-Corruption Code is critical to protecting the integrity of the game."</p>
