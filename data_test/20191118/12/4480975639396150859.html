      <p>The USD/JPY pair gained some follow-through traction for the second consecutive session on Monday, with bulls making a fresh attempt to build on the momentum beyond the 109.00 handle.<br/> <br/>The mentioned handle coincides with the very important 200-day SMA, above which the momentum could further get extended back towards the recent swing highs – around the 109.45-50 region.<br/> <br/>This is closely followed by over three-month-old ascending trend-line <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, which if cleared decisively might be seen as a key trigger for bullish traders and pave the way for additional gains.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> maintained their bullish bias and reinforce the constructive set-up, albeit slightly overbought conditions on hourly charts warrant some caution.<br/> <br/>Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a sustained breakthrough the ascending trend-line resistance before positioning for any further appreciating move, possible beyond the key 110.00 psychological mark.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, immediate support is now pegged near mid-108.00s, below which the pair might turn vulnerable and accelerate the fall towards testing sub- 108.00 levels (the 108.00-107.90 region). </p>
