      <p>The likes of Football Manager 2020, Metro Exodus, and Rage 2 will now also be available to buy and stream when Stadia launches tomorrow.</p>
      <p>When Google first announced their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/google-stadia-launch-line-12-games-including-red-dead-redemption-2-11082931/">launch line-up</a> of games last week a lot of people scoffed at the list of just 12 games, most of which were released last year.</p>
      <p>And then when Microsoft announced that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/project-xcloud-streaming-service-adds-xbox-game-pass-games-11148301/">Project xCloud</a> was getting all the games from Xbox Game Pass it seemed like Stadia was beginning to feel like an also-ran before it even started.</p>
      <p>But while they might not know much about the games industry Google is, of course, a massive company with near infinite resources, so now, just a few days later, their launch line-up has increased to a total of 22.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia launch games</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection</li>
        <li>GYLT</li>
        <li>Just Dance 2020</li>
        <li>Kine</li>
        <li>Mortal Kombat 11</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Rise Of The Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Samurai Shodown</li>
        <li>Shadow Of The Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</li>
        <li>Thumper</li>
        <li>Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</li>
        <li>A.O.T. 2 Final Battle</li>
        <li>Farming Simulator 19</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
        <li>Football Manager 2020</li>
        <li>Grid</li>
        <li>Metro Exodus</li>
        <li>NBA 2K20</li>
        <li>Rage 2</li>
        <li>Trials Rising</li>
        <li>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of the extra games are those that were originally scheduled for release sometime later this year, so there’s not technically any new ones – but it does show that Google can make things happen very quickly when they need it.</p>

      <p>That means there’s now more 2019 games in the launch line-up, including Football Manager 2020, Metro Exodus, and Rage 2.</p>
      <p>There’s also Codemasters’ Grid which is the only major game to feature Stadia exclusive features, by having <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/grids-40-car-races-possible-google-stadia-claim-codemasters-11097246/">40-car races</a> that its developer claims would be impossible on any other format.</p>
      <p>As a final bonus the excellent <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/27/samurai-shodown-review-the-spirit-of-snk-10077911/">Samurai Shodown</a> will be added as a second free game for Stadia Pro members, as well as the previously announced Destiny 2: The Collection.</p>
      <p>Stadia launches tomorrow, 19 November but only the Stadia Pro version of the service – Stadia Base, which does not require a subscription, won’t be ready till next year.</p>
