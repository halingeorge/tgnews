      <h1>Did this Redskins fan rip a football away from a young Jets fan?</h1>

      <p>Well, that's one way to leave the stadium happy.</p>
      <p>There weren't many jubilant Washington fans in the stands Sunday at FedEx Field as theRedskins were on the receiving end of a 34-17 drubbing by the Jets, but one of them was smiling after doing something curious.</p>
      <p>Jets wide receiver Robby Anderson had just caught a touchdown pass from Sam Darnold in the second quarter when he jumped into the stands to celebrate with Jets fans in the corner of the end zone. Anderson seemed to be handing the ball to a young Jets fanwhen a Washington fan appeared to rip the ball away.</p>

      <p>The video isn't necessarily clear and convincing, but when slowed it certainly looks as if the young fan is reaching for the ball when the Redskins fan darts in for the forced fumble.It doesn't appear that Anderson is willingly handing the ball off to anyone while he's in the stands, though logic would dictate that maybe the ball was going to go to the Jets fan once Anderson regained his bearings. We may need a second camera for all this.</p>
      <p>No harm, no foul, however: Young Jets Fan in Beanie seemed thrilled with the score and to be near Anderson, and rightfully so —Anderson, Darnold and the Jets would go on to win decisively just outside the nation's capital.</p>
      <p>To give credit where it's due, it was a great defensive play from that Redskins fan. Aggression after the ball, securing it close.</p>
      <p>Though, Jamal Adams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_XLB3fRYUw&amp;feature=youtu.be">perfected this technique but a week ago</a>.</p>
