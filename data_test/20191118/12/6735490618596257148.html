      <p>The 25-year-old is on the cover of the new <a href="https://www.elle.com.au/celebrity/halsey-interview-22641"><i>Elle Australia</i></a>, and in the issue she discusses the future of her career, including her fears about “cancel culture.”</p>

      <p>“When I first started out, my team didn’t really understand cancel culture,” she says. “There would be a bad response to something I said and I would be like, ‘This is it, I’m done.’ And everyone would be like, ‘Relax, you’re not going to lose your career over one thing you said on the internet.’ Now it’s like, ‘No, you actually f**king can.’”</p>

      <p>Halsey also talks about an important conversation she once had with Taylor Swift about their place in the world as women.</p>
      <p>“If I could make sense of everything that was going on in the world right now, I wouldn’t be a musician,” she explains. “Taylor Swift and I were once talking about our positions as female in culture and she said, ‘We’re not gladiators, we’re musicians.’”</p>

      <p>As for what the future has in store for her career as a musical artist, Halsey admits, “I believe very, very vehemently that I don’t need to do this if I don’t want to. I will stop the second I don’t enjoy it anymore and have no qualms about that. I do this because I f**king love it, because I really couldn’t imagine doing anything else.”</p>
