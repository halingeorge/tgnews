        <b>David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) and Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) couldn’t be happier in Emmerdale about the fact that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (Joe Warren-Plant) has finally begun to move on following his ordeal at the hands of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein). However, the pair are set to get <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/emmerdale-spoilers-maya-stepney-for-shock-return-after-prison-release-10971975/">some incredibly upsetting news tonight</a> — and it’s something that could set the young man’s progress back.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, Maya groomed and sexually abused Jacob for the majority of a year. The truth came out earlier this year when — following a night out with her mates — Priya (Fiona Wade) saw Jacob and Maya kissing.</p>
      <p>She wasted little time in informing Leyla and Tracy (Amy Walsh) — both of whom subsequently sought revenge.</p>
      <p>After everything that transpired on the night in question, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/26/emmerdale-spoilers-maya-stepney-and-jacob-gallagher-flee-together-in-shock-double-exit-9686596/">Jacob and Maya fled the village</a>, but David ultimately set a trap and Maya returned, before being apprehended by the police.</p>

      <p>She was later sentenced to prison, as an emotional Jacob bid her farewell from the gate.</p>

      <p>It’s been a long road, but David and Leyla finally managed to recover their relationship with Jacob, and the young man has started to move on — which is why they’re devastated tonight when they learn that Maya is being released from prison.</p>
      <p>After hearing the news, David then informs Leyla — who’s equally as devastated by what she’s learned.</p>
      <p>With Maya out of prison, will she attempt to contact Jacob?</p>
      <p>There are no current plans for the character to return, but Jacob could very well attempt to get back in contact with her when he learns of her release.</p>
