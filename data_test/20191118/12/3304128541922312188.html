      <p>The 2019 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examination results are out and many are wondering how to check the scores before they are delivered to schools across the country.</p>
      <p>While releasing the result on Monday, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha noted that candidates, parents and guardians can check the results via Short Message Service (SMS) by sending the candidate’s Index Number followed by the word “KCPE” to 20076.</p>
      <p>This can be done from any network i.e. Safaricom, Airtel or Telkom.</p>
      <p>The cost of each SMS is Ksh25.</p>
      <p>This year’s top KCPE candidate is Andy Michael Munyiri who scored 440 marks.</p>
      <p>Munyiri sat his exams at Damacrest School in Thogoto.</p>

      <p>Three candidates tied in the second position with 439 marks. They are; Flavian Onyango of Chakol Girls, June Cheptoo of Sangalo Central Academy, and Sean Michael Ndungu of Kitengela International School.</p>
      <p>A total of 1,088,986 candidates sat for the exams this year with 527,294  (50.1 per cent) being boys and 525,070 (49.9 per cent) being the number of girls who sat for the exams.</p>
      <p>In this year’s result,  Magoha said there was a drop in the number of candidates who scored 400 marks from 11,000 in 2018 to 9,770 in 2019.</p>

      <p>Boys outshined girls in Maths, Science and Social Studies while the girls beat them in languages such as English, Kiswahili, and Kenya Sign Language.</p>
      <p>There was a drop in Mathematics and a significant improvement was recorded in English, Kiswahili, Kenya Sign Language, and Social Studies.</p>
      <p>Magoha stated that Form One selection will be completed by December 2 adding that 9000 students will receive scholarships to study in different schools across the country.</p>

      <p>The CS said all the 2019 candidates will be given admission to secondary school as part of the government’s 100 per cent transition program.</p>
      <p>“We have assured our children that all of them will have a place in Secondary School. The President has given us very firm instructions to ensure a transparent, fair and very quick placing of these children… By December 2, every child in this country should be able to know which school they are going to, ” said Magoha.</p>
      <p>Magoha noted that cases of exam malpractices reduced significantly saying “there were one or two cases of impersonation and none of the exam papers leaked which is historic.”</p>
      <p>He stated that this year cases of teenage pregnancies reduced compared to 2018 and lauded parents and teachers for their support during the examination period.</p>

      <p>The Education ministry has been releasing the results earlier than in previous years for the past three years.</p>
      <p>The test that took three days began on October 29 and came to an end on October 31.</p>
      <p>Magoha had stated that the result was going to be out by Christmas to enable parents to plan properly for Form One admission requirements in 2020.</p>
      <p>“We shall ensure before Christmas, the children know the secondary schools they will be joining so parents can start preparing earlier,” Magoha stated.</p>
