      <p>ROCHESTER, N.Y. — A western New York man has pleaded guilty to threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Patrick Carlineo entered the plea Monday in Rochester to charges that carry up to 10 years in prison. His sentencing is set for February.</p>
      <p>Omar, a Democrat, is among the first Muslim women in Congress.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the 55-year-old Carlineo called her office March 21, told a staffer the congresswoman was a “terrorist” and threatened to shoot her.</p>
      <p>His lawyer, Sonya Zoghlin, says Carlineo is passionate about his beliefs and has taken responsibility for using threatening language to express them. Zoghlin says Carlineo never intended to harm Omar.</p>
      <p>U.S. Attorney James Kennedy Jr. says the case highlights that free speech rights carry responsibilities not to threaten lawmakers because of disagreements with them.</p>
