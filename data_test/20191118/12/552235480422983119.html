      <h1>Alan Irvine interviewed by Hearts after Steven Naismith makes glowing recommendation</h1>
      <h2>The Scot has worked for some big clubs south of the border as a manager and behind the scenes.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:20:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Alan Irvine is a contender to become Hearts’ new manager or sporting director.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understands the club interviewed the 61-year-old last week after being recommended by striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-naismith">Steven Naismith</a> .</p>
      <p>Irvine worked with the Scotland international at both Everton and Norwich City, where he was assistant and caretaker manager respectively. He most recently assisted David Moyes at West Ham.</p>
      <p>The former Queen’s Park and Dundee United player has had spells managing Preston North End, Sheffield Wednesday and West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>However, Irvine also has experience behind the scenes as well, having served as academy director at both Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>That, combined with a wealth of experience and contacts, could make him well suited to the sporting director role.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> are seeking to fill both positions, with the sporting director charged with going out and getting in the players the head coach wants.</p>
      <p>The club initially planned on appointing a sporting director first, although priorities have shifted with several interviews taking place with applicants for the manager’s job last week</p>
      <p>Former Rangers and Motherwell boss Stuart McCall, along with ex-Hearts winger <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-mccann">Neil McCann</a> were part of the first phase of interviews.</p>
      <p>Owner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> is now turning her attention to candidates currently at other clubs, and those who have recently left jobs but still face contractual issues.</p>
