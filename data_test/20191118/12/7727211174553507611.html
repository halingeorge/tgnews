      <h1>Amazon drops price of Apple Airpods in surprise sale ahead of Black Friday 2019</h1>
      <h2>Amazon's 'Countdown to Black Friday' sale includes rare discounts on products which are never reduced</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:31:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/catherine-murphy/" target="_blank">Catherine Murphy</a></address>
      <p>Amazon's Black Friday deals are set to drop this week ahead of its official date but it looks like the retailer just couldn't wait to offer some big savings.</p>
      <p>In a surprising move, Amazon has today dropped a 'Countdown to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/boots-black-friday-deals-2019-17215905">Black Friday </a>sale' which includes a huge price drop on Apple Airpods.</p>
      <p>The discount makes the item £100 cheaper than its currently priced in Apple stores.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/32TusjL">Cutting the price from £159 to £129</a>, Amazon has slashed £30 off the iconic buds, which might not seem like much, but is a considerable discount for an item whose price tag rarely sees much movement, reports MirrorOnline.</p>

      <p>Coming complete with charging case and cable, the same earphones will still set you back £249 at the Apple Store right now.</p>
      <p>If you're an Amazon Prime member, you'll also get free delivery on the Apple Airpods.</p>
      <p>But the Airpods aren't the only impressive gadget to get a discount today, with Amazon launching plenty of other offers as part of its countdown sale, before everything fully kicks off this Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>For example, Amazon's Echo Dot is now £34.99, rather than its usual £49.99.</p>
      <p>There is also a range of discounted homeware available too.</p>
      <p>You can shop the deals <a href="https://amzn.to/2QtkMKj">here.</a></p>
