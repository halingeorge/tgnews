      <p>A new Facebook Messenger app for Windows 10 is on the way. Facebook <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/facebook-messenger-getting-desktop-app-end-end-encryption-and-more">first announced</a> that a new app was on the way to Windows 10 and Mac in April 2019. Now, a version of that app has appeared online. <a href="http://www.aggiornamentilumia.it/2019/11/17/facebook-messenger-desktop-anteprima-della-nuova-beta-in-arrivo-per-windows-10/">Aggiornamenti Lumia</a> shows off the new Facebook app in a video and breaks down some of its features.</p>
      <p>According to Aggiornamenti Lumia, the rewritten Facebook Messenger app brings several features to Windows 10 that are not available in the current Windows 10 app, including the ability to permanently delete sent messages, new themes (dark theme, grey theme), the ability to send files, a full Screen Mode, the ability to hide chats, a new icon, and updated emoticons.</p>

      <p>At first glance, the app looks similar to the current Windows 10 app, but it has some notable differences when compared to the current app. The new app is powered by Electron and is developed to work across multiple platforms. As a result, it's much more likely that this Facebook app will remain updated with new features over time.</p>
      <p>Aggiornamenti Lumia states that the new Facebook Messenger app will be downloadable through both the web and the Microsoft Store. At this time, there doesn't seem to be a place to download the beta version of the app.</p>
