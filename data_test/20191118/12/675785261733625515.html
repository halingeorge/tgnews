      <h2>Manchester City boss Guardiola has been linked with a return to Bayern but agent Josep Maria Orobitg has played down reports he could go back to the Allianz Arena</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:53:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's agent Josep Maria Orobitg has played down reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss could return to Bayern Munich as Niko Kovac's successor.</p>
      <p>Kovac was relieved of his duties after a 5-1 humbling by Eintracht Frankfurt and has been replaced by coach Hansi Flick for the remainder of 2019 as Bayern source a long-term successor.</p>
      <p>Reports in Germany had suggested Guardiola could be in line for a return to the Allianz Arena - but Orobitg insists the Spaniard is happy at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>"In football, nothing is certain," Orobitg told <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/pep-feels-good-at-man-city-guardiolas-agent-plays-down/a5k7nmzjbkh31lqvi9pt4w4dv">Goal.</a></p>
      <p>"I spoke with Pep last Wednesday, and everything is the same: He feels good at Manchester City and also in the city of Manchester, and he has a contract until June 30, 2021.</p>

      <p>"Nobody but the press contacted me about the future Pep."</p>
      <p>Arsene Wenger held talks with Bayern chief Karl-Heinz Rumenigge but the duo could not strike a deal and the Frenchman has now taken on a new role at FIFA.</p>
      <p>Erik ten Hag, Thomas Tuchel and Jose Mourinho have also been linked with the post as Bayern look to cut the four-point gap to Bundesliga leaders Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
      <p>Guardiola spent three years as Bayern boss between 2013 and 2016 - winning three Bundesliga titles and two German Cups.</p>
      <p>He has claimed two Premier League titles so far at Manchester City along with two League Cups and the FA Cup as the Blues completed the domestic treble last term.</p>
      <p>But defeat at Anfield prior to the international break saw them slip nine points off the title pace behind table-topping <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
