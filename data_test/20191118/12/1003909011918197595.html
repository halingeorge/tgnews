      <h1>Nelson: Veterans deserve more respect from all Canadians</h1>

      <p>Lest we forget isn’t much of a challenge to the majority of native-born Canadians.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is drop a toonie in a box once a year, stick a fake flower in your lapel and know that Vimy united the nation, we were there at Juno Beach and a bunch of Canadians once fought and died for our values and we should honour them.</p>
      <p>That’s about it. Not much to remember at all, is it?</p>
      <p>Then, once you’ve finished mouthing John McCrae’s poem, you can get on with life, as we do after making that obligatory call to mom on Mother’s Day after popping a sweetly worded card in the mail.</p>
      <p>So when TV hockey commentator Don Cherry lambastes immigrants for not showing vets respect he might ponder how much respect those born in Canada show past and present members of our Forces, outside of those few days marking the Armistice, 101 years ago.</p>
      <p>Not much would be the answer.</p>
      <p>Which is why, for example, most people haven’t a clue that a majority of the Canadian Corps that fought for the first time under a countryman’s command at Vimy Ridge were actually immigrants.</p>
      <p>Yes, more than half of those 15,000 troops in the four divisions were born in the United Kingdom. But then again that’s hardly surprising because Canada itself didn’t declare war on Germany but entered automatically, as its foreign policy was the concern of Great Britain in 1914. At least we waited a week before doing similar in September 1939.</p>
      <p>And, as for the First World War being nation-building: that’s a crock, too. It almost split this country in two.</p>
      <p>As deaths mounted, enthusiasm waned and recruits dwindled. So thoughts turned to conscription and moves in 1917 to make that government policy led to deadly riots in Quebec, many citizens of that province not surprisingly believing this was a British war. Why should they fight when no one was actually bombarding Montreal? (Imagine a Coach’s Corner commentary on that.)</p>
      <p>Still, the Conscription Crisis did lead to Canadian women getting the federal vote, as Prime Minister Robert Borden first opened the franchise door to mothers, wives and sisters of men fighting overseas, believing they’d vote for his party as opposed to the hopelessly split Liberals. It worked and the Unionist Party won. Women’s suffrage never looked back.</p>
      <p>Wow. Who’d imagine history could be so convoluted? Likely not Cherry, who waxes lyrical about D-Day landings but probably knows squat about the months following in Normandy. He probably thinks the Falaise Gap is something to do with a Canadiens forward’s missing front teeth.</p>
      <p>That’s what is annoying about this nasty “us and them” argument, sparked by Cherry’s comments about immigrants coming to Canada to dine on milk and honey but rarely wearing a poppy.</p>
      <p>Someone arriving from the Philippines — that country supplying the most immigrants last year — at least has a good reason in being ignorant of Canadian history, having being educated elsewhere. But people born here can’t use that excuse, if they were asked what was transpiring 75 years ago across the Scheldt. (Don’t hold your breath for an answer.)</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago, I was in Phoenix airport and watched current and former servicemen and women using a special lounge exclusive to them. Earlier I’d visited a nearby museum where the entrance fees specified that veterans get in free. How often do you see such gestures in Canada?</p>
      <p>Sure, we roll up with a few tins of baked beans at Remembrance time for the veterans’ food bank, but if we really cared there’d be no need for such annual grovelling because we’d look after those people properly all year round.</p>
      <p>Remembrance Day is at best tokenism and at worst hypocrisy. So before deriding immigrants, all Canadians should learn much more about this country’s history.</p>
