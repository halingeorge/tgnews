        <b>Liverpool will not be able to enjoy a spell of dominance in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>, partly because <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> will re-emerge as a title-winning force, claims Graeme Souness.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Reds are top of the table, eight points clear of nearest rivals Leicester and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>, and on course to win their first ever Premier League title.</p>
      <p>Victory over defending champions <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> in their last outing has given Jurgen Klopp’s side a mammoth lead in the title race and puts their fate firmly in their own hands for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>As dominant as the Reds seem now, though, former Liverpool captain and manager Souness cannot see them hoovering up Premier League titles from here on in.</p>
      <p>The quality of the competition is simply too good for any side to dominate completely, believes the Scot, with Man City, Chelsea and Manchester United all likely to cause Liverpool problems in the years to come.</p>

      <p>‘You can never say they will go into a period of dominance because you have to look at Manchester City – they will be around for a long time,’ Souness told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/graeme-souness-insists-liverpools-full-20898058">Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>‘There’s the emergence of Chelsea ’s youngsters too. Will they get better in the next few years?</p>
      <p>‘And Manchester United will be back, guaranteed. It’s just a case of when. So you can’t say Liverpool are going to dominate.</p>

      <p>‘But once you’ve won the first one, it does give you a taste to win it again. When I was there I was made to feel, “This is what we do – win leagues”.</p>
      <p>‘That was the number one aim on the first day of the season, the league, not the European Cup. They felt that said more about you as an individual and a team.’</p>
      <p>Liverpool are odds-on favourites to win the Premier League title this season and continue their quest to lift the trophy for the first time at Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Following the current international break the Reds have a brutal run of fixtures, which sees them play 13 games in less than six weeks between 23 November and 2 January across all competitions.</p>
      <p>Their ability to compete across the Champions League, EFL Cup and Club World Cup while maintaining their Premier League challenge will be tested severely over the festive period.</p>
