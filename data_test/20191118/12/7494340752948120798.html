      <h1>Microsoft: We're Changing All Your Cloud Contracts After Privacy Complaints</h1>

      <p>Microsoft is rolling out new privacy provisions in its Online Services Terms (OST) <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-were-changing-all-your-cloud-contracts-after-privacy-complaints/">contracts for all commercial customers</a> after European privacy regulators began investigating it over potential violations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). From a report:<i> The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) last month said it had "serious concerns" over Microsoft's contracts with European institutions and compliance with GDPR rules. It kicked off an investigation in April after the Dutch Ministry of Justice found that telemetry data Microsoft collected from Office 365 ProPlus and Office 365 users violated GDPR. However, EDPS in October also noted that a new agreement between Microsoft and the Dutch Ministry of Justice (MoJ) for contractual and technical safeguards and measures to mitigate risks to individuals was a "positive step forward". The new OST reflect the contractual changes Microsoft developed with the Dutch MoJ, according to Julie Brill, Microsoft's chief privacy officer and corporate vice president for global privacy and regulatory affairs.</i></p>
