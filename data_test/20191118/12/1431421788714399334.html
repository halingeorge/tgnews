      <h1>Israel's UN Envoy Slams 'Radical Voice' Bernie Sanders on Gaza Comments</h1>
      <h2>Danon attacked recent comments by Sanders, saying presidential hopeful 'undermines the security of both Israel and the U.S.'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:40:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968833" target="_blank">Haaretz</a></address>
      <p>Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations slammed U.S. Senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Sunday night at the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) gala in New York City.</p>
      <p>Danon attacked recent comments by Sanders, saying Sanders' position on Israel “undermines the security of both Israel and the U.S.”</p>
      <p>“Perhaps Mr. Sanders didn’t hear about Israel leaving Gaza in 2005,” the <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2019/11/israels-u-n-envoy-blasts-sanders-over-u-s-aid-comments/">ambassador said</a>. “Maybe he hasn’t had the chance to visit the Kerem Shalom crossing, where hundreds of trucks pass daily to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza. Maybe he doesn’t know about the terror tunnels.” </p>
      <p>Danon was refering to recent comments Sanders made at the annual J Street conference in which he suggested that the U.S. should condition aid to Israel and even give some of that aid to the Palestinians.  </p>
      <p>“[Sanders] is suggesting to give less military assistance to the United States’ most important ally in the Middle East in order to give it to Hamas, a terrorist organization that celebrated the tragedy of 9/11,” he said. </p>
      <p>“Let me assure you my friends, we will never let that happen,” Danon insisted. “We will fight against these radical voices.”</p>
