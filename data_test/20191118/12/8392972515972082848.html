      <p>An author from Essex will be charging her family £40 each to cover the costs of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">Christmas Day celebrations</a>.</p>
      <p>Mandie Holgate told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10338865/charge-family-40-christmas/">The Sun</a> she loves hosting her family her family during the festive season - but it comes at a price she was finding too expensive.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old said she decided to bill her loved ones for the cost of their big dinner - including drinks and crackers - after being shocked by her bank statement following Christmas 2017.</p>
      <p>She said: "In total I've worked out it costs more than £700 to buy lunch... I'm not made of money."</p>

      <p>Having requested contributions from her family for last year’s merrymaking, she intends to do the same for the 14 relatives she will be having round this year.</p>
      <p>Among them are her husband, two teenage children, their son’s girlfriend, her parents, her siblings and their partners as well as a further four kids.</p>
      <aside>It all adds up.</aside>
      <p>Each relative will be expected to stump up £40 - with two of the younger members of the family asked to pay £20 apiece - to cover the £70 turkey, all the trimmings and £200 of booze.</p>
      <p>But not everybody is happy with the arrangement - Mandy admits she had to take one grumbling relative through what they’re paying for on a spreadsheet last year.</p>

      <p>She continued: "I know some people think it is bonkers how much I spend on just one day, and I know other people will kick up an absolute fuss that I'm charging my family.</p>
      <p>"But, I realised - especially as the kids in the family were getting bigger - that I was spending an absolute fortune on Christmas Day. It all adds up and you wouldn't get free food in a restaurant."</p>
      <p>It was also reported that Mandie's colleagues were amused by her idea - but soon came round and said it was "amazing".</p>
