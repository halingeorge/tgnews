      <h2>Kenton Knight, of Swindon, Wiltshire, can now be named and shamed after flouting an order to stay away from Burger King and two shopping centres in the town</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:37:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Tom Seaward, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A tearaway <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/teenagers">teenager</a> will spend Christmas in jail after a reign of terror which saw him banned from a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burger-king-inc">Burger King</a>, two <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/shopping-centres">shopping centres</a> and a community centre.</p>
      <p>Kenton Knight, 14, can today be named and shamed after a furious judge said his anti-social behaviour had "affected the public detrimentally".</p>
      <p>The baby-faced teen was previously given a court order banning him from the fast food outlet and shopping areas in Swindon, Wiltshire, but just weeks later Knight was spotted loitering on a street corner in the area when he should have been in school.</p>
      <p>And on Friday, the youth was locked up for two months.</p>
      <p>His tearful mum asked custody officers if she could give the teen a cuddle before he was taken down.</p>

      <p>She said: "So he's going to be away for Christmas. He's only a boy."</p>
      <p>But Michael New, chairman of the bench at Swindon Magistrates' Court, said: "Kenton has waived his right to anonymity by repeatedly committing anti-social behaviour in public and behaviours which affect the public detrimentally.</p>
      <p>"Local people who have been affected need to be aware of him and what has happened today.</p>
      <p>"You have many court orders against you - and you have shown complete disregard for all those court orders."</p>
      <p>Knight is well known to the youth court, with his name appearing several times in the lists this year. These offences were linked to anti-social behaviour and covering his face with clothing.</p>

      <p>But the injunction last month stated he should not be at the Burger King, shopping centres or community centre in Wiltshire unless he had an adult with him.</p>
      <p>He was also told to be in school between the hours of 9am and 3pm and to stay away from a 17-year-old who cannot be named.</p>
      <p>Describing the two-month sentence as a welcome result, PCSO Philip Day of Wiltshire Police said: "Knight's prolific and relentless behaviour in our communities for a significant amount of time has caused alarm and distress to many victims, young and old.</p>
      <p>"The injunction served on Knight in October provided clear boundaries that he has clearly chosen to ignore, and as such he has now received today's sentence.</p>
      <p>"We hope that Knight's time in detention will go some way in changing his offending behaviour when he returns back into the community."</p>
