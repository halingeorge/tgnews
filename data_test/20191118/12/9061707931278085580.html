      <h1>Clough shuffling pack for Salford replay after rehab plans scuppered</h1>
      <h2>Brewers had not expected to have to play FA Cup tie during international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:05:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:05</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Clough says Burton Albion’s rehab plans for their injured players were thrown out of the window by the FA decision to make them play their FA Cup first round replay against Salford City tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>The manager and his physio team will assess the Brewers walking wounded in training today – that is, those able to train – before trying to put together a patched-up team for the tie at the Pirelli Stadium (7.45pm).</p>
      <p>“We had wrongly assumed that the game would be cancelled,” said Clough.</p>
      <p>“All of our plans were geared towards the League game next Saturday. We didn’t think we’d be playing on Tuesday and all of the rehab was planned that way. We’ve had to change it around, get a few lads in and try to make sure they’re OK for Tuesday.”</p>
      <p>Burton collected three new injuries in last Tuesday’s Leasing.com Trophy defeat at home to Mansfield Town, Jake Buxton and John-Joe O’Toole coming off with back issues and David Templeton reporting a sore knee.</p>
      <p>Clough hopes all three might make it for tomorrow and that, just maybe, defenders Richard Nartey (hamstring) and Reece Hutchinson (hip) might be back in contention.</p>

      <p>“David Templeton’s knee was quite swollen after the game, the next day, so it’s really just a case of wait and see with him,” said Clough.</p>
      <p>“John-Joe’s back was easing slightly after the game but you know when him and Jake Buxton are coming off that they have got something. We’re not sure how long they will be.</p>
      <p>“We’re hoping we can get them out there on Tuesday night but then you have a knock-on effect because we have Saturday-Tuesday-Saturday to consider after that. That’s as well as Richard Nartey, Reece Hutchinson and Lloyd Dyer (ankle) being out. It’s going to be a testing time with the injuries.</p>
      <p>“We might have to rush people back to get 11 players out there and then, if they’re not quite ready, if they haven’t had enough training time, it will put them at risk of further injury. We like them to have a certain amount of training time before they are back into match action.</p>
      <p>“Richard and Reece would have to train on Monday morning to have a chance of playing because they haven’t done anything for quite some time now. We will assess them in the morning and see if they are OK for training.</p>
      <p>“There is an injury protocol. You have to do be able to do certain things before you join back in training, never mind the game. But we are in danger of having to disregard that, just to get people out there for such an important game.”</p>
      <p>Nartey and Hutchinson have both been sidelind longer than the manager had hoped.</p>
      <p>“That is what happens when you have so many games,” said Clough. “Richard has been carrying his and Reece tried to play on as well.</p>
      <p>“He missed a game, came back and was back too early. That’s the knock-on effect of them coming back too early and it is what we are frightened of this week.”</p>
      <p>The Brewers – and Sunderland – had asked the FA if they could delay their replays for a week because tomorrow’s date falls within the international break. Burton have three players on international duty and Sunderland four.</p>
      <p>Salford were happy to make the change. The Black Cats’ opponents, Gillingham, were not but the FA’s decision appears not to have been influenced by any of the four clubs.</p>
      <p>“I have to say, Salford were brilliant,” said Clough. “They said, we completely understand, if you want to move the game, we will play it the week after, no problem at all.”</p>
