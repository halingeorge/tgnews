      <h1>Kieran O'Hara's Republic of Ireland start 'brilliant' says Nigel Clough</h1>
      <h2>Burton's on-loan Manchester United keeper won his second cap against New Zealand</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:20:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Kieran O’Hara’s first start for the Republic of Ireland shows what a good move it was for the 23-year-old goalkeeper to come to Burton Albion on loan, says Brewers manager Nigel Clough.</p>
      <p>The Manchester United man played 66 minutes for the Republic in their 3-1 friendly win at home to New Zealand last week. He had previously won his first senior cap as a substitute against Bulgaria in September, another game the Republic won 3-1.</p>
      <p>“It is absolutely brilliant for him and complete justification for Manchester United letting him out on loan,” said Clough.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he would have been making his international debut if he wasn’t playing regularly and, not only that, he is playing exceptionally well.</p>
      <p>“We have been so pleased with him in the last few months since he came in and I know (Republic of Ireland manager) Mick McCarthy is and Manchester United are.</p>
      <p>“It’s brilliant for everybody. For Kieran to get that debut, without making a start for his parent club, is great for him and his confidence. He’s already quite a confident lad, not cocky or anything, just nicely confident and, hopefully, that will help him even more.”</p>
      <p>Clough was asked if O’Hara’s start for the Republic might make United think about recalling him but the manager does not think that likely.</p>
      <p>O’Hara has previously had loans with non-League Trafford, where he played 20 times, AFC Fylde (no games), Morecambe twice, playing five times in his second spell, Stockport County, where he played once, and Macclesfield Town, where he spent last season and helped them avoid relegation from the Football League on the last day.</p>

      <p>Clough thinks the keeper’s next step might be one more level up – but not this season.</p>
      <p>“If eveybody’s happy and he’s certainly happy, then I don’t envisage it being a problem,” said Clough.</p>
      <p>“I think next season will be the problem. We’ll look to keep him but they will look for him to move on to the next stage, which will probably be a Championship club. I just hope that’s us. That’s what we’re aiming to do</p>
      <p>"If we have a chance of getting promoted, then we have a chance of keeping him.”</p>
      <p>Also on international duty, Liam Boyce was an unused substitute for Northern Ireland’s goalless draw at home to the Netherlands on Saturday and is in the squad for Tuesday night’s game in Germany. Nathan Broadhead is in the squad for Wales Under-21s’ home game against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Tuesday night.</p>
