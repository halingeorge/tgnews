      <h2>NSW Transport taps data from smart parking systems.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:27:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/justin-hendry-1167397" target="_blank">Justin Hendry</a></address>
      <p>Sydneysiders who use free public transport parking when commuting can now see how many vacant spaces are available in select car parks before hopping in the car.</p>
      <p>Transport for NSW has begun surfacing real-time car park occupancy data for Opal Park&amp;Ride car parks at Ashfield, Korgarah, Manly Vale and Seven Hills through third-party apps under a new trial.</p>
      <p>Opal Park&amp;Ride car parks, which can be found in ten locations across Sydney, are free for up to 18 hours a day as long as a public transport journey is completed. A further ten car parks are planned.</p>
      <p>The trial is aimed at helping commuters better plan their journey before they arrive, so they can opt for alternative arrangements such as walking, cycling or catching public transport.</p>
      <p>The data, which is initially available through AnyTrip, is collected using the smart parking systems at the car parks and released to “a select group of endorsed third-party app developers” on TfNSW’s open data hub.</p>
      <p>“AnyTrip is the first third party app developer to support this trial,” a TfNSW spokesperson said over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“The real-time car park feature will provide customers with an approximate number of parking spaces available at each location along with predictive occupancy patterns based on historical data.”</p>
      <p>The trial is the latest expansion of TfNSW’s real-time data project, which until now has largely focused on real-time occupancy of Sydney Trains to allow passengers to pre-empt crowding.</p>
      <p>The data, which is available through both <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/sydney-trains-weighs-carriages-to-estimate-crowds-491064">transport apps</a> and on <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/sydney-trains-brings-real-time-occupancy-data-to-stations-525443">platform indicator boards</a>, is collected from in-built sensors under the axle of each Waratah train.</p>
