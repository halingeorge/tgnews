      <h1>How to Get the Double-Bladed Lightsaber in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</h1>

      <p>Darth Maul had one line and maybe five minutes of screen time in <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, and yet kids have loved him ever since for one reason: dude just looks sick as all hell. He’s got that demon head with all the spikes everywhere, like an outer space version of a Jim Rose Circus sideshow act, and rides a levitating space Harley. Most importantly he’s got the kewlest lightsaber around. It’s not just one but two, fixed together at the hilt, and he spins that double-bladed contraption around like a helicopter blade built exclusively for bisecting Jedi. If you took that dude who doodled Slayer logos on his desk in seventh grade and asked him to design a <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Star+Wars">Star Wars</a> guy, it’d look just like Darth Maul—the sickest and the coolest.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Star+Wars">Star Wars</a> Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, the brand new <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Star+Wars">Star Wars</a> game from the folks who made <i>Titanfall 2</i>, doesn’t let you play as Darth Maul. You’re stuck with this red-headed Archie looking herb named Cal Kestis, and getting this nerd to loosen up and act rad is an uphill slog. There’s one quick and easy shortcut to making him look roughly 130% sicker, though, and that’s by outfitting him with a double-bladed lightsaber. Fortunately it’s pretty easy to get one, and it can be found within the first few hours of the game.</p>
      <p>Here’s what you have to do. After you wrap up your tasks on the planet Bogano, you’ll be able to travel to a couple of new planets. One of them is Dathomir. (If you’re a walking Wookieepedia, you probably know that Dathomir is where a certain Darth Maul is from.) Dathomir is pretty tough this early in the game—the other planet that opens up at the same time, Zeffo, is where you’re supposed to go next, but you have the freedom to tackle ‘em in either order, and only Dathomir will get you that sweet twofer sword. So Dathomir it is.</p>
      <p>Dathomir is home to the Night Sisters and Night Brothers, tough warriors who you’ll encounter repeatedly on your search for that lightsaber. They can be a hassle, but finding your way to the bench where you can build the double-bladed lightsaber isn’t. If you take a right out of your ship and follow the path indicated on your map, you’re headed in the right direction. The double-bladed lightsaber can be found in a place called Brother’s Bastion, which you can get to after climbing and wall running through Dathomir’s scenic vistas. When you get to Brother’s Bastion and see a cloaked figure waiting to talk to you, look for a spot where you can drop down into a workshop tucked away below. There you’ll find the bench that lets you craft this special lightsaber. There’s not much else to do in Dathomir, at least not right now, so you’ll have to fight your way back to your ship and head to Zeffo to keep progressing in the game. At least Cal will look a good bit cooler—and be able to pull off some awesome saber movies—with his new weapon.</p>
      <p>There’s also apparently a second way to get a double-bladed lightsaber early on. Cal’s droid BD-1 eventually unlocks the ability to perform something called a Scomp Link on the planet Zeffo. As with Cal’s own Force powers, you can use that ability to open up areas that were previously closed off to you—including on the planet Bogano, which you’e already been to. Once BD-1 can Scomp it up, head back to Bogano, and return to the workshop you’ve already visited. There’s a locked door there that BD-1 can now open, and inside this room you can craft a double-bladed lightsaber. This takes a little bit more time than the Dathomir route, as you have to wait to acquire skills during the game’s storyline, but it’s not as challenging, and that hour or so delay is made up entirely of stuff you’ll have to do anyway in the course of the game. So it’s basically up to you which path you take to the coolest lightsaber ever seen.</p>
