      <p>Selena Gomez made a very rare red carpet appearance last night, attending the ACLU's Bill of Rights dinner in Beverly Hills. The singer dressed like the ambassador of fall, wearing a burnt orange Prada dress with a matching lip on the red carpet. <i><a href="https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-slays-in-pumpkin-spice-colored-cocktail-dress-see-her-latest-red-carpet-look-136523">Entertainment Tonight </a></i>accurately called the dress pumpkin-spice hued. Nothing gets more autumnal than this velvety look, honestly:</p>

      <p>Gomez was at the dinner to present her friend Justin Tranter, a LGBTQ+ activist and a songwriter she has worked with for years, with the Bill of Rights Award. They posed together on the red carpet:</p>

      <p>Gomez's appearance at the ACLU Bill of Rights dinner comes after <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29808951/selena-gomez-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-taylor-swift-reaction/">she took a stand publicly for her friend Taylor Swift</a> amid <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29811842/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-drama-timeline/">her public battle</a> with Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta over whether she can play her old music during recorded appearances. (They own her song catalog.)</p>
      <p>Gomez had strong words for Borchetta and Braun, writing, "My heart is so heavy right now. It makes me sick and extremely angry. (I don’t mind if there may be retaliation) this is my opinion. It’s greed, manipulation, and power. There is no heart or thought of anyone else. No respect for the words my friend has written since she was a 14-year-old in her bedroom.<br/>You’ve robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with her fans and the world."</p>
      <p>"People grow from choices. Some will stay exactly the same," Gomez added at the end of her statement. "I just want a change of heart."</p>
