      <h1>GMB guest says 'child prostitution isn't paedophilia' in row over Prince Andrew</h1>
      <h2>Lady Colin Campbell, who has published several books on the Royal Family, made the paedophilia remark on Good Morning Britain during a segment about Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:50:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Former I'm A Celebrity contestant Lady Colin Campbell has provoked uproar by claiming on live TV that a child being prostituted is 'not the same as paedophilia'.</p>
      <p>The royal biographer said there was "a difference" between the two as she appeared on Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old made the astonishing comment during a segment on the allegations surrounding Prince Andrew and the late billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Stunned hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid challenged Lady C over her remarks, but she refused to concede defeat before insisting there is 'a difference between a minor and a child'.</p>

      <p>"You all seem to have forgotten that Jeffrey Epstein, the offence for which he was charged and for which he was imprisoned, was for soliciting prostitution from minors," she said, defending Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and his friendship with disgraced Epstein.</p>
      <p>"That is not the same thing as paedophilia," she added.</p>

      <p>When Piers questioned what it was, she replied: "Prostitution".</p>
      <p>Flabbergasted Piers fumed: "If you solicited a 14-year-old for prostitution you’re a paedophile.</p>
      <p>"You’re procuring an underage girl for sex. That’s what he was convicted of. I’m sorry, with respect, that is nonsense."</p>

      <p>Lady C insisted she was not "justifying Epstein" but appeared to put her foot in it even more when she went on to add: "I suspect there’s a difference between a minor and a child."</p>
      <p>Horrified viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to share their shock at Lady C's comments.</p>
      <p>One said: "Lady Colin Campbell on GMB saying procuring and selling a 14 year old is not pedophilia because a minor is different to a child? I’m sorry, what?! Can she hear herself?!"</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "Dear Lady Colin Campbell. A minor IS a child. A child is not prostituted, it is not prostitution, it’s abuse, you despicable old witch. Try speaking to survivors of child abuse, listen to their agony and then try excusing it."</p>
      <p>And a third added: "Lady Colin Campbell on GMB. Utterly embarrassing sticking up for Andrew, saying a 14 YO is not a minor &amp; that pedophilia and child prostitution is two different things."</p>

      <p>Lady C, also commented on why she believes Prince Andrew, 59, did not cut ties with Epstein, 66, who hanged himself in a New York jail in August.</p>
      <p>She said: "He does things in the correct way. You dump people in person.</p>
      <p>"He has made many mistakes, you can’t criticise someone because they aren’t as bright as you would like them to be."</p>
      <p>The Duke of Andrew has denied allegations he slept with a 17-year-old girl.  </p>
