      <p>Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja are straight up couple goals. The #everydayphenomenal duo’s life sure makes for a modern-day fairy-tale. Everything from their goofy selfies to their Skype calls to travelling the world together and even taking front seats at international couture shows is the stuff of dreams. Ruling our Instagram feeds yet again, we have the lovebirds winning us with their new vacay pictures.</p>
      <p>Sonam and Anand are currently in the States and have been giving us a glimpse of all the fun on their social media handles. In one of the pictures, Sonam can be seen wearing a black crop top along with black tights. She has rounded off her look with a snapback and black sneakers. Anand, on the other hand,  opted for leopard print shorts, a black full sleeve t-shirt along with a pair of sneakers. The power couple can be seen posing post their fun trek.
