      <p>DUBAI: Air Arabia said Monday it would buy 120 Airbus A320s in a deal worth $14 billion that represents a major expansion for the United Arab Emirates low-cost carrier.</p>
      <p>“The first delivery is expected to start in 2024,” said Adel Al-Ali, the CEO of Air Arabia, based in the emirate of Sharjah which borders Dubai.</p>
      <p>Air Arabia currently operates a total fleet of 53 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft.</p>
      <p>Last month it announced an agreement with Abu Dhabi-based giant Etihad Airways to launch a new low-cost airline based in the UAE capital.</p>
      <p>The new carrier, Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, will be launched in “due course,” Etihad said at the time.</p>
      <p>Etihad, established in 2003 by the oil-rich Gulf emirate’s government, has faced stiff competition from Dubai aviation giant Emirates and Doha-based Qatar Airways.</p>
