      <p>Despite concerted alerts by banks and financial institutions and a series of awareness campaigns by government, police and other agencies on online frauds, a Sub-Inspector of Police has fallen victim to an online fraudster.</p>
      <p>K. Krishnamurthy, 58, SI attached to the Bazar police station here, lost ₹ 99,968 between October 9 and November 17 after he parted his bank account number to the fraudster.</p>
      <p>Acting on his complaint, the Bazar police registered a case against an unknown accused under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 66 D of Information Technology Act.</p>
      <p>Police said the fraudster had called from Mobile number ’91 6289206148’ and took the SI for a ride. It appeared that the fraudster did not strain his nerves much as the police officer parted with his bank account number and other details when the fraudster asked for the details to renew his ATM card.</p>
      <p>The fraudster had called him, introducing him as Canara Bank official and sought details to renew and send him an ATM card, police said.</p>
      <p>The SI also gave his residential address for the card to be despatched. Since October 9, the fraudster withdrew money from his account at four instances – ₹ 38,980, ₹ 9,999, ₹ 9,999 and ₹ 39,990, police said.</p>
      <p>The online fraud came to light on Sunday when the SI visited an ATM centre to withdraw money and checked the balance amount.</p>
