      <p>PIKE, Ky. (AP) — A Kentucky man on death row for murdering a student has worked out a deal to convert his death sentence into a life sentence without parole.</p>
      <p>The Lexington Herald-Leader reports Circuit Judge Eddy Coleman approved a motion Friday to set aside 69-year-old Roger Dale Epperson’s death sentence and re-sentence him to life without parole.</p>
      <p>Epperson was convicted of murdering 23-year-old Tammy Dee Acker in August 1985. The University of Kentucky student was fatally stabbed during a robbery at her father’s home.</p>
      <p>Epperson has an appeal pending in federal court of his conviction and sentence which could have gone on until Epperson was in his 80s.</p>
      <p>The judge and Acker’s family agreed that if Epperson would give up the appeal of his conviction the death sentence would be removed.</p>
