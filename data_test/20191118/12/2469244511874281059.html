      <h1>Fight parking fines and tickets with advice from Money Saving Expert</h1>
      <h2>56 per cent of people who do fight a parking ticket win, says Martin Lewis website</h2>

      <p>The number of parking fines and tickets being issued is rising,  but the number of people appealing against them fines has fallen eight per cent year on year, says <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/parking-ticket-appeals/">Money Saving Expert</a></p>
      <p>However,  the site - set up by Martin Lewis - says that 56 per cent of people who do fight a parking ticket win,  and don't have to pay.</p>
      <p>With fines running from anything between £25 or £100 - even higher in some cases - and the fact that launching an appeal doesn't have to cost you anything - it is worth fighting.  And most councils will let you launch an informal appeal without the cost of the charge doubling<a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/how-fight-parking-ticket-according-3544362">, reports Hull Live.</a></p>
      <p>According to  <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/parking-ticket-appeals/">Money Saving Expert</a> , the first step is to identify your ticket - If it is called a Penalty Charge Notice, it is an official parking fine from a local authority, transport body or the police. It could also be called a Fixed Penalty Notice or an Excess Charge Notice - if it is one of the latter it is a criminal ticket rather than civil and the process is different.</p>
      <p>If it is called a Parking Charge Notice - or something similar - it is most likely from a private company.</p>
      <p>In either case, if you're in the wrong - pay up. There are ways to fight unfair tickets from both councils and companies but if the ticket is fair, there is not much chance of winning.</p>
      <h3>Fighting Penalty Charge Notices</h3>
      <p>When fighting a local authority Penalty Charge Notice, the next step is to gather evidence - take pictures of any signs, markings, bays, lines and if possible your car where it is parked.</p>
      <p>Remember there is 10-minutes leeway if you're parked correctly in a council space. Those rules came into force in 2015.</p>
      <p>Keep all correspondence and any ticket or receipt you have.</p>
      <p>Keep any relevant evidence - if you broke down for example then keep any paperwork</p>
      <p>If there are any witnesses - anyone who can corroborate your story - get their contact details and ask them to sign a statement detailing what they saw.</p>
      <p>According to  <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/parking-ticket-appeals/">Money Saving Expert</a>  you should never pay a fine you plan on appealing - paying a fine is an admission of liability.</p>
      <p>When appealing, there are official grounds which set out the only reasons a ticket can be ruled unfair - and overturned.</p>
      <p>They are - the signs were wrong, the council or warden got it wrong, the council made an error on the ticket or letter, the traffic rules are wrong, you didn't own the vehicle when the ticket was issued, the warden had an opportunity to put a ticket on a vehicle but decided to send a letter instead, your car was stolen, you were overcharged.</p>
      <p>You can also claim mitigating circumstances, such as your car broke down, you were attending an emergency, you were clearing an obstruction from the road, you were dropping off someone who is ill, you were recently bereaved, you were going to a funeral or your ticket fell out of the window.</p>
      <p>Next - launch the informal appeal. There should be an address or email address on the ticket or letter. There may also be a form to fill in online.</p>
      <p>Submit all the evidence you have gathered, stick to objecting on the grounds set out above and include any mitigating evidence.</p>
      <p>Make sure to appeal with 14 days - or 21 days if your fine was sent by letter.</p>
      <p>At this stage you should still only be liable to pay the half price fine if you lose.</p>
      <p>If your informal appeal fails, or you didn't appeal in time you can go to a formal appeal process - this is when your fine will double.</p>
      <p>Instead of just sending a letter or email there will now be a form to fill in. Include all your evidence, objections and mitigation again.</p>
      <p>If this fails you will get a letter of rejection.</p>
      <p>You can now go to an independent tribunal - the contact details will be sent with your rejection letter.</p>
      <p>By this point, you will have lost the chance to pay half the fine - but there are no further costs associated with continuing.</p>
      <p>You won't have to attend a hearing, but you can if you like, and you can also give evidence over the phone.</p>
      <p>Again it will be a case of filling in a form, writing a letter and sending all your evidence and statements.</p>
      <p>If you lose, you'll have to pay the full fine - if you win, you pay nothing.</p>
      <p>All of that relates to fines from a local authority - such as your council.</p>
      <h3>Fighting Parking Charge Notices</h3>
      <p>If you're dealing with a parking charge notice from a private company- remember it is not a fine, it is an invoice.</p>
      <p>Again gather all the evidence - pictures, statements, tickets, correspondence etc.</p>
      <p>If the parking company is part of a trade body there are a few steps you can take.</p>
      <p>Some say simply ignore the charge notice - but it is worth noting that they can apply to the DVLA for your details and start proceedings that could result in solicitors letters, bailiffs and court dates - with spiralling costs.</p>
      <p>You could contact them and say you won't pay - it will then, again, be up to the company to decide if they want to pursue you through the courts.</p>
      <p>The most 'legitimate' method is to follow the official procedure - starting by following the company's appeals procedure which will be set out on their notice.</p>
      <p>Detail why you think you shouldn't pay and include any evidence.</p>
      <p>If this fails you can then appeal to the trade body the company is affiliated to - which will mean either an appeal to Popla or the Independent Appeals Service.</p>
      <p>With both, and the company will have to tell you which to use, you can appeal online or by post by filling in forms and sending all your evidence.</p>
      <p>Popla cancelled 52 per cent of the tickets it was referred and while the IPA doesn't publish figures 17 per cent of tickets were cancelled by the company that issued them when the case was referred.</p>
      <p>If you lose your appeal - you then have to decide whether you want to pay. If you don't the company may take you to court. If you lose here you will have to pay the fine plus any costs, which could start at up to £410 or more if a hearing is held.</p>
      <p>Also, remember to contact the land owner - if you got a fine from a private company it may have been while you were parked at a hospital, shopping centre or something similar.</p>
      <p>The land owner may simply have the fine cancelled for you.</p>
      <p>If your ticket is an Excess Charge Notice from a council - the process is the same in terms of gathering all evidence and launching an appeal.</p>
      <p>You will probably have to go straight to a formal appeal procedure, and if that fails you may be appeal to appeal to a more senior officer within the same local authority. If that fails, you can appeal to the ombudsman - your council will be able to give you the correct contact details.</p>
      <p>If you get a Fixed Penalty Notice from the police, it is likely you will need to go to court to challenge it.</p>
      <p>Some forces allow an informal appeal, so check your letter or ticket for details.</p>
