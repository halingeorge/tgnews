      <h1>Man Utd to take £67m hit after failing to qualify for the Champions League</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United have released their latest financial figures with Old Trafford chief Ed Woodward also providing an update for supporters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:36:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:36</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United expect their annual revenue to fall by around £67m due to their failure to qualify for the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have released their financial figures for the first quarter of 2019-20, posting revenues of £135.4million</p>
      <p>The figures represent a £400,000 increase on the same period for the previous year.</p>
      <p>Commercial revenue was £80.4million, a 5.9 percent increase on the previous year.</p>
      <p>But United are expecting 2020 annual revenue to be down this year to somewhere between £560-580million, compared to £627.1million for the year ending June 30, 2019.</p>

      <p>In part that will be due to the club's lack of Champions League football this season. Broadcasting revenue for the quarter was £32.9million, a 23.1 percent and £9.9million drop on the same quarter the year before.</p>
      <p>The figures published on Monday cover the period July 1, 2019 to September 30 of this year.</p>
      <p>One of the most eye-catching points on the balance sheet is the increase of net debt, from £247.2million to £384.5million, a rise of 55.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>The club's wage bill has dropped by 8.8 per cent "primarily due to reductions in player salaries as a result of non-participation in the UEFA Champions League", the statement said.</p>

      <p>United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: "We have a clear vision in terms of football philosophy and recruitment.</p>
      <p>"The significant investments that we have made in recent years in areas such as transfers, recruitment infrastructure, analytics and our academy are already beginning to bear fruit.</p>
      <p>"We are very proud to be shortly approaching a milestone 4,000th game featuring an academy player, and we are particularly optimistic regarding the considerable young talent currently coming through.</p>
      <p>"Our ultimate goal is to win trophies by playing exciting football with a team that fuses graduates from our academy with world-class acquisitions."</p>
