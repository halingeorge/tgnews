      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/riverdale/">Riverdale</a> actress <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lili-reinhart/">Lili Reinhart</a> has spoken out against photoshopping apps which encourage or enable people to change what their bodies look like.</p>
      <p>She has called apps like BodyTune ‘hazardous to our health’.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Hustlers star took to Instagram to voice her concerns on Sunday, 17 November, after stumbling across BodyTune in search for a photo re-sizing app.</p>
      <p>The app markets itself as ‘Make me slim, skinny booth’.</p>
      <p>Lili actually screenshotted the process you go through on the app to make your arms and waist skinnier, saying ‘this is not okay’.</p>
      <p>She shared a lengthy discussion on her Instagram stories, saying ‘social media has become hazardous to our health’ and ‘people have unrealistic expectations of their bodies’ because of BodyTune and similar apps.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘If you photoshop your body, you are adding to this problem.’</p>
      <p>It’s clear this topic is very close to Lili’s heart after she <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/lili-reinhart-glamour-uk-cover-interview-2019">opened up recently about her experiences with her eating disorder to Glamour UK</a>.</p>

      <p>‘Even today, I see myself in the mirror and think, this doesn’t look the way the world tells me it should,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t have a cinched, minuscule waist. I do have curves, I have cellulite, my arms aren’t stick thin.</p>
      <p>‘This is my body and we’re told that it should fit certain proportions. There’s such a disgusting problem right now with people photoshopping their bodies.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously, there’s a reason why people do it, they’re insecure, they feel like they’re not good enough, and that’s incredibly sad.’</p>
