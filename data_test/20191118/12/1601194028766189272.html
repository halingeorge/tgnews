      <p>The players’ draft<b> </b>for the 2019/20 <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/bangladesh-premier-league">Bangabandhu Bangladesh Premier League</a> was held on Sunday, November 17 in Dhaka. In the highlight of the event, Dhaka Platoons picked four-time BPL winner and ODI captain <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/mashrafe-mortaza">Mashrafe Mortaza</a> late into the draft as their second A+ category player. Platoons had earlier gone for opening batsman Tamim Iqbal as their first A+ category player.</p>
      <p>Rajshahi Royals picked Liton Das, Sylhet Thunders went for Mosaddek Hossain while Cumilla Warriors chose Soumya Sarkar as their A+ category players. Amongst the overseas players, Chattogram Challengers picked up <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/chris-gayle">Chris Gayle</a>, Rajshahi Royals went for Englishman Ravi Bopara while Mohammad Nabi was roped in by Rangpur Rangers, to be coached by former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower. Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik had pulled out of the players’ draft at the last moment and was unavailable for selection. Out of a total of 620 players (439 foreign and 181 local), each team had to choose at least six foreign and nine local players.</p>
      <p>BPL draft commissioner Mahbub Anam had recently changed the rule on picking up category A+ cricketers through a special ordinance and increased it to two per team in return for extra money by the sponsors. The tournament is scheduled to start on December 11.</p>
