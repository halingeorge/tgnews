      <p>Popular Kumawood actress Mercy Asiedu has become the latest celebrity to be trolled by some social media users for repeating dress.</p>
      <p>In the first photo, she was attending an interview on UTV recently; and in the other one, she was starring in a movie.</p>
      <p>According to some who commented on the post, the movie was shot about four years ago which is a long time, therefore, it was bad for her to have repeated it.</p>
      <p>Others argued that there was completely nothing wrong with repeating clothes.</p>
