      <h1>WhatsApp bug could have let hackers read your messages by just sending a video</h1>
      <h2>Users who do not download an update for the latest version of the app are still vulnerable to the hack</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:06:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Cuthbertson</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> has acknowledged a security flaw within the app that allowed hackers to access people's messages by sending a malicious video file.</p>
      <p>The Facebook-owned messaging app posted a security advisory about the bug, named CVE-2019-11931, which affects earlier versions of the app on both Android and iOS devices.</p>
      <p>The advisory described the issue as a "stack-based buffer overflow" that was capable of triggering dangerous code through sending a "specifically crafted MP4 file to a WhatsApp user".</p>
      <p>Facebook did not provide specifics about what the video might look like, or if victims needed to open the MP4 file in order for the hack to be executed.</p>
      <p>A fix has been issued but users who have not <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-update-latest-download-android-battery-features-a9198551.html">downloaded the update for the latest version of WhatsApp</a> are still vulnerable to the hack.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the company said:"WhatsApp is constantly working to improve the security of our service. We make public reports on potential issues we have fixed consistent with industry best practices.</p>
      <p>"In this instance, there is no reason to believe that users were impacted."</p>
      <p>Despite Facebook claiming that there is no evidence of the security flaw being exploited, it remains unclear whether any hackers attempted to target victims through the bug.</p>
      <p>Last month, WhatsApp revealed that a "significant" number of activists and journalists were targeted with spyware reportedly developed by controversial Israeli software firm NSO Group.</p>
      <p>Around 1,400 WhatsApp users received a message warning of the campaign and advising to update to the latest version of the app.</p>
      <p>"In May we stopped an attack where an advanced cyber actor exploited our video calling to install malware on user devices," the message stated.</p>
      <p>"There's a possibility this phone number was impacted, and we want to make sure you know how to keep your mobile phone secure."</p>
