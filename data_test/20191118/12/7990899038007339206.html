      <p>A shooting has been reported at a Walmart in Duncan, Oklahoma. At least three people are dead, but the motive and precise circumstances of the shocking incident are not yet clear. Here’s what we know about the developing case.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Three Dead, Including Shooter</b>
      </p>
      <p>Local police say that three people, including the suspect, are dead, according to <a href="https://www.duncanbanner.com/suspect-in-walmart-shooting-dead-according-to-dpd/article_91453416-0a20-11ea-8c5c-1beafd2338c8.html#utm_campaign=blox&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><i>The Duncan Banner</i></a>. District Attorney <b>Jason Hicks</b>, of District 6, said this is no longer an active shooter situation.</p>
      <p>The outlet reported that at about 9:54 a.m. CT there were calls regarding a shooting at the Walmart.</p>
      <p>Police <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2669174489808808&amp;id=789533027772973&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCeYyb53HEPaovD_PC2WfgUqWrvQrSAMUudF3f0ASIEmZZGuwI1obUYsOuqFcJXFoECOKwbOYycBBaRS7D_JR-v5yhURaSP2j2quRlTeYq13WmcHzMSTltpvTx8KnPN7ewR2O1TTavNu91sAwxO7E2h11MYXgLNHDHZj2-BNi0LifxpQH-HOOZzKdIgb2QUjD1wTGKckj8lZ0YrSjq6tZYecETgpx8aMpfXeu4qQPZ1Nkg6hwAXE0Sq3LQC5zORpRpYfkzbLmTY8QvwR3ocr3gwi9yYTBGYBrmi5qB4P2jqSZzPu7R5fxYLM4x1QS0-_-X2h7pVID9fvXJucoH5Pw&amp;__tn__=-R">confirmed</a> online that they found three people dead. There was one woman and one man in a car, and one man outside of the car, they said. A handgun was found at the scene, officers said.</p>
      <p><b>Lynn Gregston</b>, the owner of a nursing home across the street from the shooting, told <i><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/18/walmart-shooting-several-wounded-attack-duncan-oklahoma/4228530002/?fbclid=IwAR0nhU6dJoASDScKpSLfHHUP6S4TTg8TNXibGWlxk-qpGLP8f5Y6h5EqLjU">USA Today</a></i> that investigators told him the gunmen shot himself after opening fire on two other people.</p>
      <p>“Everything is in control,” he said about his facility. “We locked it down using our alert system.” He said his residents were okay.</p>
      <p>The identity of the suspect has not yet been confirmed.</p>

      <p>
        <b>2. Motive Unclear</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was a mass shooting at an El Paso, Walmart in August, and the suspect in that case allegedly admitted to targeting “Mexicans.” <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/el-paso-shooting-suspect-patrick-crusius-admitted-to-targeting-mexicans-cops-say/">The motive and precise circumstances of this new Oklahoma incident remains unclear</a>, however.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Yet Another High-Profile Shooting</b>
      </p>
      <p>This incident follows just days after a shooting at a high school in <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/coroner-identifies-one-of-the-students-killed-in-the-saugus-high-school-shooting/">Santa Clarita, California</a>. Gun control advocates immediately urged policy change.</p>

      <p>In September, Walmart responded to the El Paso shooting and a shooting in Southaven, Mississippi by announcing changes. The company <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/03/walmart-stop-selling-ammunition-call-congress-new-laws/2198475001/">said it would stop selling certain ammunition </a>and called on Congress to enact “common sense measures.”</p>
