        <b>A plurality of independents are tuning out the impeachment hearings, according to a recent poll.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 36 percent of independents <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8770/8684/Topline%20Reuters%20Impeachment%20Hearings%2011%2015%202019.pdf">said</a> they did not watch, read, or hear anything about the hearings.</p>
      <p>Of the 64 percent of independents who have paid some attention to the hearings, only 19 percent actually watched them. Seventeen percent said they watched or listened to news summaries, and 30 percent said they read or listened to news summaries.</p>
      <p>While the poll shows that most independents are paying attention, it also shows that they are not as engaged as other demographics.</p>
      <p>The poll showed that Democrats were the most engaged demographic — with 35 percent watching or listening to the hearing compared to only 26 percent of Republicans.</p>
