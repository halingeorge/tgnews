      <h1>You can meet Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon in Bristol - but it will cost you £75</h1>
      <h2>The tour's 'super VIP' experience with the man know as Johnny Rotten also includes a photo opportunity with the icon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:58:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>It will cost fans £75 to meet a punk icon when he comes to Bristol next year.</p>
      <p>John Lydon fronted The Sex Pistols, who enjoyed success with the 1977 album <i>Never Mind the B*****ks, Here's the Sex Pistols</i> and sparked a cultural revolution.</p>
      <p>Next year the enigmatic punk rocker, also known by his stage name Johnny Rotten, will embark on a 54-date UK tour to coincide with the release of his new book, <i>I Could Be Wrong, I Could Be Right</i> .</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old, who once rallied against the establishment, will stop off at St George's in Bristol on the tour, where he will talk about how he sees life along with his unique career, before taking questions from the audience.</p>

      <p>But those who want the 'super VIP' experience will need to stump up more than double the price of a standard ticket.</p>
      <p>For £75, fans will be treated to the 'best seats', an unsigned photo, a tour lanyard and a pre-show meet and greet session which includes a photo opportunity.</p>
      <p>There is also the option of the £45 'VIP' ticket which is similar to the premium package but without the meet and greet.</p>
      <p>Standard tickets for seats further back in the venue and on the balconies are priced at £30.</p>
      <p>Although they only produced one album - the aforementioned 1977 effort - before disbanding in 1978, the Sex Pistols have gone down as one of the most influential in British music history.</p>
      <p>Their second single, God Save The Queen, was released to coincide with the Queen’s silver jubilee in the summer of 1977.</p>
      <p>Seen as an alternative national anthem, it rocked the establishment and was banned by the BBC, leading Lydon to become the poster boy for the nation’s moral outrage.</p>

        <i>John Lydon will be at St George's on September 29, 2020, where signed copies of his new book will be available to purchase. Tickets are on sale on <a href="https://www.stgeorgesbristol.co.uk/event/jon-lydon-i-could-be-wrong-i-could-be-right/">St George's website</a>.</i>
