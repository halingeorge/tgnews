      <p>While the recent launch of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney-plus/">Disney+</a> has brought a number of classic animated films out of the vault and brought together some of our favorite Disney TV series, the House of Mouse has also managed to provide a central place for fans of Marvel and Star Wars to enjoy their fandoms through films and TV series any time they want.</p>
      <p>Fans of the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel/">Marvel</a> Cinematic Universe or the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> franchise can now watch the biggest films in the series or some of our favorite forgotten shows, and we think it's time to celebrate our new obsession with our other geeky obsession - <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/funko-pop/">Funko Pop!</a> vinyl figures. So today we'll discuss Disney+ a bit while taking a look at a few upcoming Funko Pop! pre-orders with Entertainment Earth that can save you shipping on every order!</p>

      <p>Just a few years ago we never would have thought we could watch the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/fantastic-four/">Fantastic Four</a> on Disney given the complicated rights issues w2ith 20th Century Fox, but thankfully those characters have returned home, and Disney+ included two animated series featuring Marvel's first family.</p>
      <p>Fans can now pre-order a few new Funko's that features the entire Fantastic Four (Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing) and a few of their villains (<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/doctor-doom/">Doctor Doom</a> and Galactus) that will look great in any fan's home while they rewatch their favorite FF series.</p>
