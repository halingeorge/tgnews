      <h2>It could be a cheaper way to stock up in time for Christmas</h2>

      <p>It's about that time of year when people are starting to think about stocking up the bar for Christmas.</p>
      <p>If your tipple of choice is whisky or gin, there is a sneaky way you could get your hands on some high-end bottles for less.</p>
      <p>An auction house is selling off a huge lot of premium spirits including whisky, vodka and gin - and bidding starts at just £1.</p>
      <p>Many of the bottles would usually retail for between £30 and £50, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/its-christmas-bargain-high-end-17267298">says the MEN</a> .</p>

      <p>Stockport-based auction house Simon Charles launched the online booze <a href="https://www.simoncharles-auctioneers.co.uk/auctions/6188/Premium-Spirits-Auction-Featuring-Whisky-s-Gin-s-and-Vodka-s/1?">auction</a> last week.</p>
      <p>However some items have attracted no bids at all, meaning they could go for as little as a quid.</p>
      <p>The lot has come from a hospitality company which had intended the spirits for Christmas functions, weddings and corporate dos.</p>
      <p>Auctioneer Ed Railton said: "It's a buyers' market. Everything will be coming in at much lower than you would expect to pay at retail, which is great for people tightening their belts at this time of year.</p>
      <p>"For the price of a normal supermarket midrange, you could get something a little bit more special."</p>
      <p>Among the bottles on offer are gins and whiskies from small independent distilleries some of which are limited editions and are no longer being produced, according to Ed.</p>
      <p>While bidding has started on many of the items, many are still available for the opening bid of £1.</p>
      <p>These include 500ml bottles of Kreator Jin by Mackmyra - which retail at around £30 - and 20cl mini bottles of Darnley's Small Batch London Dry Gin, which typically cost £6.</p>

      <p>Across the rest of the lot, bottle of 12-year-old Johnnie Walker Black Label Whisky, which retails at around £30, is available for as little as £3.</p>
      <p>While a boxed edition of Jameson's Select Reserve Single Distillery Black Barrel, which is sold for £59 online, is available for just £12.</p>
      <p>Premium mixers could also be snapped up for just £1 including 24-packs of 200ml Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Ale, and 8-packs of 500ml Fentiman's Botanically Brewed Connoisseurs Tonic Water.</p>
      <p>Branded glassware sets and serving bottles are also available for a pound.</p>
      <p>Bids are being taken on the lots until 8pm on Saturday 23 November.</p>
