      <h1>‘His dream is to go to Man United’ – Player eager for quick transfer, talks expected soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:53:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Like pretty much every day, today <a href="http://tuttosport.com/">Tuttosport</a> have claims about Mario Mandzukic’s potential move to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>It’s been this way since the close of the summer transfer window, when it was claimed the striker rejected a last minute switch to Old Trafford because he didn’t feel he had enough time to consider his options.</p>
      <p>Juventus then made the decision of an exit rather easier for Mandzukic, by freezing him out of their first team squad. The Croatian hasn’t even been training with Maurizio Sarri’s side, and the Turin club tried to force through a move to Qatar.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Tuttosport say talks with Manchester United over Mandzukic could lead to negotiations about Paul Pogba. That seems to be the hope anyway.</p>
      <p>It’s stated that for the Croatian, ‘his dream is to go to Man United’, and he’d like to get a move sorted out sooner rather than later. There’s been talk of the transfer potentially happening in December, which would give the 33 year old time to train with his new club before being registered.</p>
      <p>Tuttosport mention that once again, and state talks over the deal are set to take place soon, and it’s claimed the player’s agent has been speaking to the Premier League club ‘for a few months’.</p>

      <p>Building a good transfer relationship with Manchester United can only help Juventus should Pogba be allowed to fulfil his wish for a move.</p>
      <p>As always, Tuttosport state the Frenchman still thinks highly of his former club, and would be keen on a return.</p>
