      <p>In 2008, a  boy in the streets of Harare was spotted in delight as he carried huge amounts of cash in bundles of 200 000 Zimbabwean Bearers’ Cheque Dollars in a sign of Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation.</p>
      <p>The picture went viral back in the day and has since been one of the iconic images in social media displaying vividly the economic turmoil that was and is still plaguing the entire country.</p>
      <p>A recent picture of the same, but now-grown unidentified boy has emerged showing him eleven years later-smartly dressed and healthier.</p>

        <b>Zimbabwe Today: A Matured Version Of The Old System</b>
      </p>
      <p>The picture brings about a reflection on <a href="https://iharare.com/things-fall-apart-in-zimbabwe/">Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation cycle</a>, which at one point meant a loaf of bread cost as much as 10 million Zimbabwean dollars.  That today the same loaf is going for  $15 Zimbabwean dollars means that this is just a matured version of the old system experienced in 2008.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/ft/zimbabwe-hemorrhage-stability-personal-journey">Between 1997 and 2008,</a> Zimbabwe underwent unprecedented economic decline. Inflation became the ultimate expression of failure and the most basic transactions became a challenge.</p>
      <p>Prices would treble during the short time required to pick up a product from a store shelf and reach the cash register. Paying for a loaf of bread demanded bags and bags of local currency. Buying a stock-sweet would require kids, as shown in the picture, to get into a dither with huge bands of 100 thousand Zimbabwean dollar notes.</p>
      <p>In 2009, Mugabe’s government stopped its use of the Zimbabwean dollar and converted to a multi-currency system following hyperinflation.</p>
      <p>But then in 2015, USDs started varnishing from the formal banking system forcing the government to create bond notes in May 2016 as a way to combat the shortage of US dollars, the main currency the country has been using since the conversion.</p>
      <p>However, earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.voazimbabwe.com/a/zimbabwe-currency-shortages-dollars-cash-crunch/5162175.html">multicurrency system was banned.</a> This was our government’s move to defend the Zimdollar against speculators by banning all foreign currencies in local transactions. But the effort has largely failed after the Zimdollar quickly fell prey to black market speculation that sent its value plummeting in an almost 2008 way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://iharare.com/zimbos-celebrate-as-they-receive-new-zim-dollar-notes/">Critics</a> view the printing of the new currency as a temporary measure instead of a long-lasting solution to this long-overdue scourging problem. Many are citing the Zimbabwean dollar will not hold any value because of negative fundamentals in the economy which include confidence deficit and high demand for foreign currency to import commodities.</p>
      <p>This year alone, the economy in Zimbabwe is contracting by more than 6.5 percent thereby drawing us nearer to that past age where kids walked the streets with huge bundles of worthless paper, only this time, they have grown and are experiencing the matured version of the old system they know.</p>
