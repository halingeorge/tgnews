      <p>James Harrisonis handing down his own personal punishments after Thursday night's brawl between the Browns and Steelers.</p>
      <p>The ex-Steelerslinebacker believes that Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, who has been <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-suspension-helmet-swing-browns-steelers-fine/p6a4y3lcs6841h6yyhthae7t2">suspended indefinitely</a>forrippingoff Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph's helmet and whippingit at Rudolph's head, should be facing jail time in addition to league discipline. Harrison tweeted that Garrett's behavior qualifies as "assault at the least."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Harrison opened the door for plenty of harsh replies considering his history of illegal hits. The five-time Pro Bowler delivered brutal helmet-to-helmet shots to Cleveland's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEvj1Dgvz_U">Josh Cribbs</a>and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRWZ5l0nzXo">Mohamed Massaquoi</a>during the same game in 2010 and knocked Browns quarterback <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XVAXKhYh0">Colt McCoy</a> out of a 2011 divisional matchup. (It has been a <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/afc-north-timeline-browns-steelers-division-violence/1s5mmef8sc0g51xfi7ydanvssj">violent decade for the AFC North</a>.)</p>
      <p>Former Browns defensive lineman Phil Taylor offered perhaps the nicest version of the popular response to Harrison.</p>

      <p>Harrison may think this incident goes beyond the football field, but Rudolph <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mason-rudolph-myles-garrett-helmet-swing-assault-steelers-browns/6a5frhl85mbw1vi7taixkvcn9">won't take legal action</a> against Garrett, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1195491413124952066">NFL Network's Ian Rapoport</a>. Rudolph considers the situation"exclusively an NFL matter."</p>
      <p>In addition to Garrett's suspension, Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pounceywill be out three games for punching and kicking Garrett, and Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobiwill miss one game for pushing Rudolph to the ground following Garrett's helmet swing. Harrison did get that part right.</p>

      <p>Rudolph was not suspended for his role in the melee, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mason-rudolph-suspension-myles-garrett/1e9p6e3p28vd31bqe2bgpmst3y">which left some NFL fans upset</a>, but he is expected to <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-browns-brawl-suspensions-fines-myles-garrett-mason-rudolph/67ic8xzy878h15fp3hij8ka4o">receive a fine</a>, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1195409049233158144">NFL Network's Tom Pelissero</a>.</p>
