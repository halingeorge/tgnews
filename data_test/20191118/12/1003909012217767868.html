      <h1>Torrential rains, budget cuts leave city's back alleys in a rut</h1>

      <p>Al Morasch says he and his neighbours have been fighting an ongoing back alley war with trenches.</p>
      <p>“About 10 years ago, they dug it down a foot to rebuild it, and they filled the trench with a sand and gravel mix,” said Morasch of the sloping back lane behind his Brentwood home.</p>
      <p>“As soon as it rains it just washes out and there’s a big pile of sand and gravel on the street.”</p>
      <p>That often leaves a 20 centimetre-deep trench that he and neighbours have filled themselves, he said.</p>
      <p>“You could send boats down it,” said Morasch, adding city crews haven’t shown up as often this year.</p>
      <p>It’s taken a toll on his neighbours’ vehicles, he added “but I’m fortunate I live at the bottom of the alley.”</p>
      <p>That about sums up the past year of discontent over the condition of Calgary’s alleys, after a summer of torrential rains that heavily eroded them combined with a $509,000 cut in the city budget to repair the damage.</p>
      <p>That 10 per cent rollback was part of a round of emergency spending cuts last summer to fill in a $60-million funding pothole in the city budget.</p>
      <p>It also contributed to a tsunami of 311 complaints about alleys this year — 5,600 compared to 2,463 in 2018.</p>
      <p>“That number of complaints is drastic, but those are about alleys that in some cases are impassible,” said Ward 12 Coun. Shane Keating, who sought a city administration study on the issue.</p>
      <p>The resulting report also notes the city received 272 millimetres of rain in 2019, well above the 187 mm recorded the previous year.</p>
      <p>That foul weather nearly halved the number of days city crews had to repair back lanes because the work can’t be done on wet surfaces, said the report.</p>
      <p>“Some lanes had severe damage, so crews had to go back to fix those and couldn’t do regular maintenance,” said Keating.</p>
      <p>“And, on top of that, 50 per cent of the work days is a fair amount of time to lose.”</p>
      <p>With the city looking to cut more from its budget after the province decided to take an additional $15.5 million in property taxes, alleys could be left even more rutted and potholed, said Keating.</p>
      <p>But he said the 10 per cent cut the repair budget has already endured shouldn’t be repeated, particularly when other areas only saw a 2.5 per cent across-the-board reduction.</p>
      <p>“Is there stuff we’re doing when we shouldn’t be doing be it, instead of cutting 10 per cent from back lanes?” said Keating.</p>
      <p>“Some programs have to be eliminated entirely.”</p>
      <p>Calgarians frustrated with the pitted state of their alleys can seek a local improvement provided by a city paving crew if at least 60 per cent of residents approve.</p>
      <p>But residents pick up the full tab that can be $6,000 each — a cost paid for over 15 years as an add-on to property taxes.</p>
      <p>This year, the city lists 37 such improvements approved this year, but they’re not always a road to satisfaction, said Keating.</p>
      <p>“When one of these was done in McKenzie Towne, people used it as a shortcut and were speeding down it,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said some of the responsibility has to be borne by motorists who should obey the 15 km/h back lane speed limit to reduce wear on their vehicles.</p>
      <p>Michael Shepherd said his Capitol Hill back lane “is more potholes than alley . . . only in the dead of winter are they filled enough to safely drive a vehicle without threat of damage.”</p>
      <p>But he expressed resignation over that reality, given both rain erosion and limits to city resources.</p>
      <p>“(A city crew) threw some gravel in there, about half-full per hole earlier this year, but the first big rain washed it away,” said Shepherd.</p>
      <p>“If cuts are going to be made, residential alleys are an easy go-to,” he said.</p>
