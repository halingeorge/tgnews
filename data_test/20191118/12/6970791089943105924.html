      <p>A few days ago, 50’s IG page disappeared and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/50-cent-trolling-hard-instagram-decided-disable-account-11163463/">appeared to get deleted</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>There’s is nothing 50 Cent loves more than trolling every person he can on Instagram. But the hip hop star is having to find a new hobby these days because Instagram has suspended his account It was first noticed on Thursday afternoon that the Power producer’s account was no longer available on the platform. And it’s still a no-show nearly 24 hours later. (Metro UK)</blockquote>
