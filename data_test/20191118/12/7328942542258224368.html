      <p>Are you looking for some coding <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/9-of-the-best-robot-toys-for-children-and-parents-this-christmas">toys</a> and tools for children? Then you've come to the right place. The following  10 are a great mix of toys that will help introduce or develop your child's knowledge and confidence with coding.</p>
      <h3>1. <a href="https://amzn.to/2qZ2qpZ">Code-a-Pillar</a></h3>
      <p>Well now, what have we here? Apparently an almost perfect example of coding toys and tools for children. Fisher-Price is renowned the world over for the quality of their toys but this might be a game-changer. The <a href="https://amzn.to/2qZ2qpZ">Code-a-Pillar</a> lets your child play and learn some basic coding at the same time.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The toy comprises of eight segments and a head. Each segment has a symbol on its back to show a direction or an 'action' icon such as playing music or wiggling. The segments can be linked together in a sequence and the Code-a-Pillar will follow it faithfully. </p>
      <p>There are also expansion packs for additional commands. A word of warning for parents, however. There is no volume control!</p>

      <h3>2. <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kwkdf2">Lego Boost Robotics</a></h3>
      <p>Who can argue with the idea of Lego for Christmas? Especially a Lego kit that is a perfect example of coding toys and tools for children. This set lets your little ones learn how to program robots. The kit is aimed at children between the ages of 7 and 12, but does Lego really have an age limit?</p>
      <figure>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Kwkdf2">The kit</a> comes with bricks, of course, a central processing unit and some sensors. The assembled robots can be programmed using an iPad or Android tablet with the included app.</p>

      <h3>3. <a href="https://amzn.to/2Omt18r">Coji from WowWee</a></h3>
      <p>This cute little bot is called <a href="https://amzn.to/2Omt18r">Coji</a> and it can be programmed using emojis. Kids can use a tablet or smartphone to loaf programs onto the robot and have the time of their lives. Some basic functions are also available without using a mobile device, which is nice.</p>
      <figure>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Each emoji will describe a specific robot action that can be built into a sequence. For instance, directional symbols will move the robot (as you'd expect). Adding a musical instrument will make Coji play a little tune for your child. </p>
      <p>Children can also build-in if-then statements. The accompanying app also has some games to make the experience more immersive.</p>
      <h3>4. <a href="https://amzn.to/349RrbC">Code and Go Robot Mouse Activity Set</a></h3>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/349RrbC">Here's</a> a great little toy to teach basic coding that doesn't need a computer or WiFi. Your child gets to build a maze and then program Colby the mouse to traverse it.</p>
      <p>Simple yet effective. The set comes with mazes depicted on so-called 'activity cards' that your child can build. Or, of course, your child can design their own. </p>
      <p>Coding involves basic direction commands or 'actions' like lighting up or making a sound. This one is targeted at children as young as 5 and doesn't require any reading skills.</p>

      <h3>5. <a href="https://amzn.to/2NZgTLi">Kano Computer Kit</a></h3>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2NZgTLi">Kano</a> is ideal for children who want to build their own little computer. The entire set is powered using a Raspberry Pi as well as Kano's very own OS and keyboard.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The set comes complete with an HDMI cable to connect to a TV or monitor. The Pi comes in a transparent case so kids can see the 'gubbins' at work. Cables are also color-coded to help young builders put the kit together. </p>
      <p>The set also comes with a handy guidebook to walk young ones through the entire process.</p>

      <h3>6. <a href="https://amzn.to/35a3WEm">Cubetto</a></h3>
      <p><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/cubetto-programmable-wooden-robot-teaches-kids-code">Cubetto</a> is actually a Kickstarter project from the startup company Primo Toys, It was launched in 2016 and raised 15 times its goal of $100,000.</p>
      <p>The toy is designed for 3-year-olds and is made of wood. <a href="https://amzn.to/35a3WEm">Cubetto</a> doesn't require any screens and will teach your little one the basics of programming commands. </p>
      <p>The wooden robot is controlled from a board where children insert wooden 'commands' or coding blocks.</p>

      <h3>7. <a href="https://amzn.to/2CXan1i">Electro Dough Kit</a></h3>
      <p>This one isn't necessarily coding per se, but it is a novel option worthy of consideration. It's not very often you'll see electronics and clay combined into one toy. With <a href="https://amzn.to/2CXan1i">Electro Dough Kit</a> you get just that. A company called Technology Will Save Us recently launched a kickstart to make what they call a "squishy play experience".</p>
      <figure>

      <p>The clay is a special kind called "electro-dough" which can actually conduct electricity. The kit comes complete with a simple battery pack, a speaker, and a video game-like controller. </p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The toy is aimed at kids between the ages of 4 and 6 and is designed to let them build simple circuits and mold them into any shape. It also comes with a neat app to guide children through the process.</p>
      <h3>8. <a href="https://amzn.to/2CRoHZd">Sphero SPRK+</a></h3>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2CRoHZd">Sphero</a> is, as the name suggests, a spherical robot that connects to a smart device via Bluetooth. It comes with batteries that are powered up via an inductive charger too.</p>
      <p>Sphero works with an app called Lighting Lab as well as another called Sphero Edu. Both these apps provide a platform for children to program <a href="https://amzn.to/2CRoHZd">Sphero</a> using a graphical interface.</p>
      <p>Sphero Edu also has a block-based system for commands or even real JavaScript code. The robot is waterproof and generally awesome.c</p>

      <h3>9. <a href="https://amzn.to/2qZl2WS">Ozobot</a></h3>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2qZl2WS">Ozobot</a> is a neat little line-following robot that will help kids learn the principles of coding. This little fella will follow black line drawings on a piece of paper or tablet screen. Strategically placed red dots will also make the robot perform certain actions.</p>
      <p>These can include a color change, direction change or change in speed. There is a new EVO model too but the original one is great for introducing the basic concepts of coding.</p>
      <p>EVO comes with some extra features like IR Proximity Sensing, RC-controlled movements and some autonomous behaviors.</p>
