      <p>We’re very happy to report that <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/taylor-swift/"><b>Taylor Swift</b></a> will be able to perform her old songs during her Artist of the Decade performance at the <i><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/2019-american-music-awards/"><b>2019 American Music Awards</b></a></i>!</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old singer asked fans to speak out on her behalf after she says her old label was blocking her from singing old music at the awards show.</p>
      <p>If you missed the controversy last week, here’s a quick recap: <b>Taylor</b> released an <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2019/11/14/taylor-swift-needs-her-fans-help-amid-latest-battle-with-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta/">open letter claiming</a> that her former label, Big Machine, was blocking her from performing her old songs during her Artist of the Decade performance at the AMAs. The label then <a href="http://www.justjared.com/2019/11/15/big-machine-records-denies-taylor-swifts-claim-of-blocking-her-music-the-narrative-you-have-created-does-not-exist/">released a statement denying the claims</a> and then <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2019/11/15/taylor-swifts-rep-hits-back-at-record-labels-claims/">the singer’s rep spoke out</a> to reveal the truth.</p>
      <p>A new statement from Big Machine and the AMAs’ producers Dick Clark Productions was just released.</p>
      <p>“The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms,” the statement <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/taylor-swift-amas-big-machine-dick-clark-productions-reach-agreement-1203408043/">read</a>. “This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performances. It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.”</p>
