      <p>Gemma Smith, from Oldbury, was riding a brand new bike with a group of four others on the A456 Manor Way in Halesowen when she crashed on September 14.</p>
      <p>Ms Smith was sent around 20 ft into the air and her helmet came off because of the impact after she hit the kerb of the central reservation, an inquest heard today.</p>
      <p>The accident took place on a sunny day on the outside lane of the dual carriageway, towards Hagley, with the road having a slight left-handed curve.</p>
      <p>Sgt Dean Caswell, from West Midlands Police, said after reading witness statements that there was no evidence of anything in front of her before the impact, or that she had been speeding.</p>

      <p>The helmet and one-day-old Kawasaki were inspected by West Midlands Police, who found there were no defects on either.</p>
      <p>Area coroner Joanne Lees, at Black Country Coroner's Court, gave a conclusion of road traffic collision.</p>
      <p>Ms Smith worked from West Midlands Ambulance Service's Dudley base and was described by her family as excelling in "everything she did".</p>
      <p>Colleagues, friends and family <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/dudley/halesowen/2019/10/11/funeral-held-for-student-paramedic-killed-in-halesowen-motorbike-crash/">turned out to pay their final respects at her funeral last month.</a></p>
      <p>Father Garry Smith said: "She wanted to become a student paramedic, she always wanted to help others and it was her wish to become an organ donor and we have fulfilled her wishes - we've donated them to three women.</p>
      <p>"We will always be devastated by this accident which took away Gemma far too soon.</p>
      <p>"As a family we're all very close and we do lots of activities together. We're very proud of her and she always wanted to be an organ donor."</p>
