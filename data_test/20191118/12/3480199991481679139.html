      <p>The thieves forced their way through the hedge to gain access to a yard in Victoria Road, Shifnal.</p>
      <p>They took a Karcher jet washer, and police believe because of the weight of the device, they must have used a vehicle such as a panel van.</p>
      <p>It happened between 10am and 1.30pm on November 11, and police are asking for anybody with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>Anybody who saw anything is asked to ring 101 and refer to incident 0405S 111119.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or at crimestoppers-uk.org</p>
