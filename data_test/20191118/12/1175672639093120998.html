      <h1>Cow-print tiles and Tetris-style orange furniture feature in Russian cafe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:31:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/india-block/" target="_blank">India Block</a></address>
      <p>Russian architect <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/eduard-eremchuk/">Eduard Eremchuk</a> used Tetris-like orange <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/modular-furniture/">modular furniture</a> on wheels to solve the problem of limited space in a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/tiles/">tiled</a> cafe in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/rostov-on-don/">Rostov-on-Don</a>.</p>
      <p>And Y cafe is on a square next to the Don State Public Library in the city in southern Russia. With lots of universities in the area, the owner of And Y cafe predicted a high level of footfall in the area.</p>
      <p>To cope with a lot of people in such a narrow space, <a href="https://eduarderemchuk.com/">Eremchuk</a> designed a set of modular-furniture blocks with wheels on their base.</p>

      <p>"The shapes of the furniture were inspired by Tetris cubes, which are also transformable and very mobile," he told Dezeen.</p>
      <p>"The space came out very flexible and you can change its organisation literally every day."</p>

      <p>The geometric benches and stools are made of mesh and were produced by a Rostov-on-Don furniture company called Delo.</p>
      <p>A long table for a big group of people has rounded column stands and was made by a local factory.</p>

      <p>By the windows, extended tables with chairs or high stools provides seating for individual visitors to the cafe. All the furniture is realised in a matching "energetic" shade of <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/orange/">orange</a>.</p>

      <p>To make the cafe emulate the design of a subway station, Eremchuk chose different tiles for different surfaces.</p>

      <p>The kitchen hatch is tiled in glossy, blue, square tiles, to contrast with the white walls and grey-tiled floors.</p>
      <p>In the bathroom, cafe visitors get a surprise in the form of the "unexpected cow pattern" of the wall-to-wall black and white tiles.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Even the sink is tiled in cow print, with simple white taps protruding from the zany wall.</p>
      <p>Back in the main area of And Y cafe, screens on ceiling mounts are the main decorative feature, aside from a couple of pot plants dotted around the space.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The screens play "meditative videos about urban cities, lifestyle, nature with glitch filters" to create what Eremchuk described as a "super futuristic atmosphere".</p>
      <p>Previous projects designed by the Russian architect include <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/03/01/eduard-eremchuk-pink-furry-walls-yellow-floors-russia-concept-store-retail-interior-architecture/">a concept shop with pink furry walls</a>, and a florists with a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/01/18/eduard-eremchuk-russian-florist-interiors/">sci-fi interior featuring a glowing ceiling</a>.</p>
