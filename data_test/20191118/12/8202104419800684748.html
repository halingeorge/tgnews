      <p>By Nathanial D.</p>
      <p>The other day, I was biking down a road, and then it hit me: a bus. Well, almost.</p>
      <p>Have you ever attempted to bike on a busy road in Saskatoon? If so, you’ve probably been left intimidated, worried or even scared. Saskatoon has a severe lack of bike friendly infrastructure and education.</p>
      <p>There are only three decently busy roads I can think of in Saskatoon with bike lanes: Spadina Crescent, half of 23rd Street, and two blocks of 14th Street. That’s it. In every other situation, you’re expected to bike on the sidewalk, and hope you don’t hit someone on their phone or get doored in the face.</p>
      <p>Biking on the sidewalk is probably more dangerous than an open road. Although going on the road is safer than the sidewalk, it’s not much better. You’re constantly only a couple of inches between parked cars and traffic going double your speed.</p>
      <p>I bike from March to November, as my parents don’t own a car. Every morning I bike down Clarence Avenue and there’s almost no room for me on the road. I’ve been yelled at multiple times. People should just move over a little instead of taking it out on a cyclist. You have a whole lane to drive on. I’m doing the hard work pedalling while you guys just press on the gas and drink your morning coffee.</p>
      <p>I’d also like to mention the lack of education for drivers. They all assume that I’m supposed to bike on the sidewalk. Well, I’m not trying to get a fine here, so drivers should be educated on the fact that they need to share the road.</p>
      <p>Why do drivers seem to get so annoyed at cyclists on the road? I’m doing you a favour. I’m saving the environment, creating less potholes, and living an active lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Bike friendly infrastructure would absolutely promote safety.</p>
      <p>According to Statistics Canada, 1,408 people were killed in bike-vehicle collisions between 1994 and 2012, and 7,500 were severely injured. When cyclists feel they have support from the people and the city,  accidents are reduced.</p>
      <p>It’s time to start moving away from gas-powered motor vehicles if we hope to reduce emissions and save our planet. Cycling is a great mode of transportation that’s decently quick, and produces no emissions.</p>
      <p>It’s also a great way to get your exercise in for the day. Research conducted by the Public Health Agency of Canada shows 64 per cent of adults are overweight and/or obese and 30 per cent of children are also overweight. If children and adults biked to school or work five days a week, I’m sure those percentages would be a lot lower.</p>
      <p>I know what you’re thinking: “But Nathanial, where will we park our cars?” Yes, bike lanes reduce parking and possibly narrow the lanes for traffic. However, this should not be an issue because, if done right, there would be less cars on the road, so people wouldn’t notice a huge change.</p>
      <p>Bike-friendly infrastructure could energize youth and give us confidence to go out our wheels. Bike safety issues disproportionately affect the younger population, as we can’t drive yet. Prioritizing cars only supports the older population.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon should consider updating and adding bike-friendly infrastructure on more major roads and streets, as well as increasing driver awareness. This would increase safety, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lower child and adult obesity rates.</p>
      <p>It’s time to stop burning gasoline in cars, get outside, feel the breeze, and become healthier, happier people.</p>
