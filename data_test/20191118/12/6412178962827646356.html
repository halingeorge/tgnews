        <b>Former Leicester City head of recruitment Steve Walsh has revealed that he warned then Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho over Romelu Lukaku’s attitude.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 26-year-old ended his two-season stint at Old Trafford on transfer deadline day, joining Inter Milan in a £73.75million deal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/romelu-lukaku"><b>Lukaku</b></a> has scored nine goals in 12 Serie A appearances for the Italian giants this season, while the whole United squad have only scored only 16 times in the Premier League so far this term.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united"><b>United</b></a> have missing Lukaku’s goals output, but Walsh claims they may not be missing the Belgium international’s attitude.</p>
      <p>Walsh told <i>The Athletic</i>: “When Jose signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, I remember saying to him, ‘You have to be careful with Lukaku. He is a big baby, you know.’ He said he could handle him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he really got Lukaku on-side mentally, which you have to do. That is the case with him and Paul Pogba. They aren’t my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t have touched them. Because they are good players doesn’t mean you are going to get a good team out of it.”</p>
