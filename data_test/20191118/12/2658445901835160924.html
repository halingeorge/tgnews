      <p>About 21 contentious cases decided by judges in Ondo state have been upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The State Attorney-General &amp; Commissioner for Justice, Adekola Olawoye (SAN) gave the cheering news while delivering a lecture titled: “Searchlight On The Effectiveness of Criminal Justice Law 2015 Thus Far: Feedback From Stakeholders” at the 2019 Judges seminar in Akure, Ondo state.</p>
      <p>The AG who attributed the stride to diligence, hard work and dedication to duties by the judges also commended the staff for maintaining harmonious working relationship with the management</p>
      <p>In the 21-page lecture, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) explained the need for the review of the 2015 Criminal Justice Law of the state to cure some identified lacuna in the OSACJL to enable take care of peculiarities of the state.</p>
      <p>He said “It has been observed that the state has not been adequately captured in the administration of criminal justice 2015 hence the need to amend it.”</p>

      <p>Speaking on the practicability of the reviewed criminal law, the legal luminary said the law only saddled all relevant agencies especially the security agents with additional responsibilities to protect fundamental rights of suspects as entrenched in section 10 (1) &amp; 12 (3) of the ACJL.</p>
      <p>According to him, the two sections required that confessional statements of suspects must be video recorded and tendered as evidence before court to minimize the alleged use of force to obtain statement and dehumanization of police suspects in police, DSS &amp; NSCDC detention cells.</p>
      <p>He said the law is not only intended to ensure that the system of administration of criminal justice promotes speedy dispensation of justice, protects the society rights and interests of all parties to dispute but to put an end to the alleged indiscriminate arrest and others associated with obtaining statements on trial within trial in criminal justice sector.</p>
      <p>While lauding these innovative provisions, the AG however frowned over poor level of compliance by the security agencies with the mandatory recording of suspects’ statements, arrest and quarterly report of data base of arrested persons to the office of the AG as provided in the law.</p>
      <p>He therefore called for proper funding of all relevant agencies responsible for the administration of criminal justice sector, public education and awareness to enable them these statutory duties efficiently.</p>
