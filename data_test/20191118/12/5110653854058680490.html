      <p>Dak Dance fever has infected Ezekiel Elliott.</p>
      <p>Prior to last Sunday night's game vs. the Vikings, NBC highlighted quarterback Dak Prescott's interesting pregame routine, which includes what can best be described as a "hip thrust."</p>

      <p>During Sunday's Dallas-Detroit throwdown in Motown,Prescott's running mate caught the fever, as well,following a touchdown vs. the Lions.</p>

      <p>The Cowboys would go on to win 35-27, with the Dance once again taking center stage.</p>
      <p>The Dak Dance (or Prescott Pirouette, if you prefer), took Twitter by storm â€”and the NFL soonafter. Earlier this week,49ers players Jimmy Garoppolo and Nick Bosa were caught mimicking thePrescott Pirouette.</p>
      <p>This might be the best bromance the NFL has seen, while the dance is already better than the Floss, the Wu-Tang and the Electric Slide.</p>
