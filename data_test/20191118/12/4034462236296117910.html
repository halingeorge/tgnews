      <h1>Lamborghini Urus Seized Because Driver Is A Colossal Idiot</h1>
      <h2>Turns out the Urus didnâ€™t even officially belong to him.</h2>

      <p>"With great power comes great responsibility," as the motto goes, which originated well before Spiderman. This context also extends to horsepower. Just because you may own a vehicle with lots of power doesn't give you the automatic right to use it irresponsibly, such as the case of this Lamborghini Urus owner. According to the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/lamborghini-seized-after-driver-used-17257829">Manchester Evening News</a>, the driver of a new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/urus">Lamborghini Urus</a> was caught using the city's Stevenson Square "as a race track."</p>
      <p>The Urus wasn't hard to spot because it was painted bright yellow and, well, Lamborghinis don't look like most other makes and models. The Greater Manchester Police claim an armed unit on patrol responded to the call and immediately pulled the driver over upon arrival. And then they discovered the reality of the situation.</p>

      <p>The driver was not the owner of the hi-po SUV - in fact, the car belonged to his parents. A quick background check further revealed he was only insured as a driver on their Volkswagen Golf, not the Urus. In other words, he was not insured to drive the Lamborghini and it was immediately seized by police.</p>
      <p>The traffic police publicly responded to the incident on Twitter saying: "The driver of this Lamborghini felt the need to use Stevenson Square @GMPCityCentre as a racetrack, in full view of a liveried firearms patrol. Turns out him being a named driver on his parents' Golf didn't cover him to drive the vehicle so it has been seized for no insurance."</p>

      <p>The driver, whose age is not available, apparently "borrowed it" without permission from his parents. They are the ones who now have to go to the police impound with proof of ownership and insurance in order to have it released.</p>
      <p>Responses on Twitter are generally without sympathy for the driver. "No insurance, crush, end of it," wrote one user. "What is it about Lamborghini drivers that makes them complete tools," another added. Meanwhile, someone else had this to say: "I imagine everybody offered to drive it back to the pound."</p>
