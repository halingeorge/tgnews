      <h2>Former Aston Villa and Spurs boss Tim Sherwood believes England have 'missed the boat' by not naming Jack Grealish in a competitive England squad ahead of next summer's European Championships.</h2>

      <p>The Three Lions thrashed Montenegro and Kosovo 7-0 and 4-0 over the last international break, with Gareth Southgate's side needing just a single point from the two fixtures to secure qualification.</p>
      <p>However, the England boss decided against calling up Grealish despite a number of impressive performances, culmination in the Premier League Player of the Month nomination for October.</p>
      <p>Sherwood believes that Southgate may regret the decision, giving Grealish just one more opportunity to receive a call-up in March, in which the Three Lions will play two friendlies.</p>
      <p>"I think they [England] have missed the boat on him, to be honest." Sherwood said, speaking on TalkSPORT.</p>
      <p>"I think he already should've been in [for] the last few games - I know he's picked up an injury but I'm not sure he was included anyway."</p>
      <p>"You have two friendlies in March, but I think it may be a bit late for Jack. 100% they missed the boat on him."</p>
      <p>Sherwood believes that Grealish would provide 'something different' for Southgate's side, with the former Villa boss seeing his abilities first hand during his spell at Villa Park, in which Grealish was given a number of first-team opportunities.</p>
      <p>He even went as far as comparing Grealish to the likes of England legend, Paul Gascoigne, whilst admitting he still has plenty of improvements to make if he's to match the charismatic former star.</p>
      <p>"This kid, the ball's his friend, he's something different. I love [Mason] Mount, I think he's got goals, I think he gets himself in the area, he runs without the ball. I like Maddison, I think he receives it in the tight [spaces], he's got good awareness, can see a pass and started adding goals." He said.</p>
      <p>"But Jack takes the ball to the opposition, he goes right at the heart of people, he dribbles is like Paul Gascoigne. He's got a long way toÂ go before he's anywhere near Paul Gascoigne, by the way.</p>
      <p>"But if he was surrounded by them great young international players what we've got at the moment, I think we've missed a trick because this kid is special. He can see the play, he creates a melee - he's the most fouled player in any league he ever plays in because he creates a melee, but he sees the pass and releases it at the right time.</p>
      <p>"Yes, he's got to add more goals to his game, he won't ever score as many goals as Mason Mount will, but what he does is releases players with freedom because he creates such a crowd around him.</p>
      <p>"He's quicker with the ball than he is without it, and that's a mindset.</p>
      <p>"If we're out of possession, yes he needs to get himself back around. If he's [Gareth Southgate's] going to play a six with two eights I would definitely be playing him. Id' be playing Mount and Grealish either side of Harry Winks at the moment."</p>
