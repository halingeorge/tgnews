      <h1>'I didn't want to leave' - Bristol City cult hero on Cotterill, Johnson and a magical time at Ashton Gate</h1>
      <h2>Scott Wagstaff was an integral and influential part of the double-winning squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T12:19:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Remarkably, Scott Wagstaff only made two league starts during Bristol City's historic double-winning season but, in certain corners, the winger is remembered with the same fondness as the standout stars of Steve Cotterill's squad.</p>
      <p>When publishing our <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bristol-city-most-important-transfers-3303819">'Most Important Signings of the Decade'</a>, the name that supporters regularly returned to as being cruelly omitted was Wagstaff.</p>
      <p>Over three seasons at Ashton Gate, Wagstaff established himself as the perfect teammate - a committed and diligent professional who could be plugged into a variety of positions and became Cotterill's go-to late substitution to try and change the fortunes of a match.</p>
      <p>His enthusiasm, selflessness, personality and character on the field, and popularity among his teammates, clearly rubbed off in the stands.</p>

      <p>However, Wagstaff's memorable time as a Robin ended rather abruptly in the great purge of 2016 as he, Luke Ayling, Derrick Williams and Kieran Agard all left the club that summer, followed by Luke Freeman the following January - as the victorious League One group was slowly broken up by Lee Johnson.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://footballleagueworld.co.uk/">Football League World</a>, Wagstaff admits that he could have stayed in BS3 with Johnson keen to retain his services but a 2015/16 season in which he made just one Championship start, with eight appearances off the bench, meant he had to leave for his own self-worth as a footballer.</p>
      <p>Wagstaff moved to Gillingham in League One on a free transfer, nearer to his home town of Maidstone, and after two seasons at Priestfield remains in the division with AFC Wimbledon.</p>

      <p>"I didn’t really want to leave,” Wagstaff <a href="https://footballleagueworld.co.uk/exclusive-scott-wagstaff-talks-unforgettable-bristol-city-spell-and-heartwrenching-goodbye/">told Football League World</a>. "He offered me a new deal, Lee Johnson, and he was brilliant with me to be fair and I really enjoyed working under him.</p>
      <p>"But I thought I have to go and play some games. That was the toughest decision of my career. I had a really good three years, made some really good friends and I still stay in touch with all the lads at Bristol now.</p>
      <p>"So in the end I chose football over my personal life. I’ve got some great friendships from that first year and the second year especially and I’ll never forget it."</p>
      <p>Four years may have passed since that double-winning glory, but Wagstaff still speaks with affection about his time as a City player and, more specifically, living in Bristol.</p>
      <p>Of that group of players Cotterill brought together - with Korey Smith the only suriviving member still at the club, following Marlon Pack's sale to Cardiff - the secret ingredient to their success went beyond just ability.</p>
      <p>That group had a definite sense of team spirit and comradeship, emphasised this summer when Wagstaff was among <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/the-good-guys-bristol-citys-2933690">11 pictured at Freeman's wedding</a>, showing the bonds developed at BS3 will be eternal.</p>
      <p>"It was such an enjoyable environment to go into every day," he added.</p>
      <p>"I was literally living in the city centre. It took me five or ten minutes to get into training which was brilliant. Now I’m driving an hour-and-a-half into training which is a nightmare.</p>

      <p>"The lads as well made it the best experience for me. On our days off we always used to do something. Whenever we were bored we would go and have a coffee or go and do something else around town and it was like you were best friends. That’s very rare at a football team you get that."</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, a major turning point for the progress of Bristol City during his time at the club was the appointment of Cotterill in December 2013 to replace Sean O'Driscoll.</p>
      <p>Under Cotterill, the Robins were transformed from relegation candidates into a League One powerhouse, setting the foundations for which Johnson has since built on.</p>
      <p>"The first moment he (Cotterill) came in the boys took note straight away,” said Wagstaff, having arrived in the summer from Charlton</p>
      <p>"He had a presence about him as well and he was very thorough in what he did. We’d have already worked on everything before it had happened in the game so we always knew what to do, where to run and where to play the ball and things like that.</p>
      <p>"It was literally already made out for you before you’d even played the game, so you’d always fancy yourselves to win when you’d dedicated yourself that much during the week."</p>
