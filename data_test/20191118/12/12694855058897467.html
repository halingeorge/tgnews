          <b>Google Stadia</b>
        </a>
        <b> is almost here, and now the selection of games set to be available at launch have been detailed by the giant tech corporation. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Originally set to launch with an underwhelming list of 12 titles, a last-minute update has pushed the total to 22, making the grand total far more attractive to players sitting on the fence. </p>
      <p>Google has also outlined a number of games coming before the end of 2019 alongside its release line-up, giving us a potential incentive to stick around if the initial rollout leaves us wanting more. </p>

      <p>Google has confirmed that <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a>, <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ghost-recon-breakpoint">Ghost Recon Breakpoint</a>, Dragonball: Xenoverse and Darksiders Genesis will be coming to the platform before this year concludes, meaning you’ll have a few titles to dig into ahead of the festive period.</p>
      <p>Stadia is set to launch on November 19 with its Founders and Premiere Editions, introducing the ‘Pro’ subscription before a free version of sorts is due to rollout in 2020. Exactly when this will launch remains unconfirmed, and will hopefully accompany a bunch of features Stadia is missing right now.</p>
      <p>We’ll have full impressions of Google Stadia coming this week where we’ll be diving into the technology and how it works in a normal environment. Expect a detailed look at the controller and catalogue of aforementioned launch games, too!</p>
