      <p>Bhuvan Bam shares, “Well, I never imagined to step into the shoes of a Stand-Up comedian, not even for once. I’ve have always appreciated this special genre of comedy and have watched a plethora of Stand-Up comedy shows in the past. However, the very thought of switching sides and entertaining audience from stage was completely alien to me until Sapan, the show’s creator approached me and I decided to go ahead. Hats off to Zakir Khan as well who is my mentor in the show. He made it a seamless affair for me in terms of preparation and I was able to deliver my maiden Stand-Up comedy act with panache. The overall experience was nothing short of an exceptional adventure!”</p>
      <p>Apart from Bhuvan Bam, the other participants in One Mic Stand are Richa Chaddha, Vishal Dadlani, Tapsee Pannu, and Dr. Shashi Tharoor.</p>
      <p>The celebrities are individually mentored by the wittiest comedians in India including the likes of Rohan Joshi, Ashish Shakya, Zakir Khan, Kunal Kamra and Angad Singh Ranyal.</p>
      <p>One Mic Stand is created and hosted by Sapan Verma in collaboration with Only Much Louder and is a five-episode series. The show is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p>
