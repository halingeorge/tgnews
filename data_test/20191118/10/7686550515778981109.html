      <p>A homeless shelter which gets 23 people off the streets of Cardiff every night is under threat.</p>
      <p>The Wallich’s Nightshelter in Riverside opened in 1998 and has been offering emergency accommodation 365 days a year.</p>
      <p>People who stay there get a safe night’s sleep, support from a dedicated team, a hot shower and meal as well as laundry facilities.</p>
      <p>It is open to people aged 18 and over who are sleeping rough in Cardiff and still forms part of Cardiff Council‘s emergency homelessness provision.</p>
      <p>Five years ago, it was under threat when funding ran out.</p>
      <p>There was a 10% cut in a Welsh Government and Cardiff Council grant which has never been reinstated.</p>
      <p>A fundraising campaign in 2014 saved the Nightshelter, but as demand rises, the charity has said it's under threat again unless £89,000 a year is raised.</p>
      <p>According to Welsh Government, rough sleeping across Wales has increased by 45% in the last three years 2015 – 2018.</p>
      <p>The venue is also where Cardiff Council and The Wallich rough sleeping intervention teams <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/one-women-wearing-just-tracksuit-13768051">cook food and plan for their morning "breakfast run"</a> .</p>
      <p>On the streets of Cardiff city centre, the teams are currently seeing between 50 and 70 people sleeping rough every morning.</p>
      <p>The charity is asking people to think of it when planning festive fundraising ideas.</p>

      <p>It said £40 paid for a bed for the night and suggested selling raffle tickets, holding a Christmas Jumper Day, a Christmas quiz or swapping the office Secret Santa for a donation would all help towards the total for the next year.</p>
      <p>Head of communications and public affairs at The Wallich, Amy Lee Pierce, said: " We’re currently seeing unprecedented numbers of people sleeping rough on the streets of Cardiff; the highest figures we have ever seen. This national crisis cannot be solved overnight, and there’s plenty of political will and action, but this takes time – something the people we support do not have.</p>
      <p>"The average age of a rough sleeper at death is 44 years for men and 42 years for women and in 2018 the ONS estimated that 726 homeless people died across England and Wales.</p>
      <p>"We cannot lose this vital service at this crucial time. It is absolutely imperative that we keep the lights of our emergency Nightshelter on for people currently experiencing the darkest time of their lives."</p>
