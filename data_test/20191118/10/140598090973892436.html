      <h1>Students warned they are most at risk of breathing in toxic air, as Bristol study finds they live in the city's most polluted areas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:05:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/lizzie-roberts/" target="_blank">Lizzie Roberts</a></address>
      <p>University students are one of the groups most at risk of exposure to air pollution in Bristol, a study has found, as five people are dying early every week in the city as a result of toxic air. </p>
      <p>Campaigners and local officials have called for legal commitments to be enforced to tackle the issue, which can also lead to severe health effects. </p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/bristol-set-become-first-uk-cityto-ban-diesel-vehicles/">Bristol City Council </a>voted to ban all diesel cars from the city centre during the day from 2021. The decision was taken in a bid to reduce the level of air pollution in the city, which is currently 1.2 times over the legal limit.</p>
      <p>In response to the study, released by campaign group<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/20/nhs-boss-announces-air-pollution-emergency-major-study-shows/"> UK100 and King’s College London</a>, Marvin Rees, Mayor of Bristol, said: “We have a moral, ecological and legal duty to clean up the air we breathe. </p>
      <p>“This research emphasises how vital it is that we act quickly to improve health and save lives in Bristol.”</p>

      <p>The report measured the combined impact of two forms of toxic air pollutants, PM2.5 and NO2. PM2.5 is produced from the burning of domestic wood and coal fires, while NO2 primarily comes from older polluting vehicles. </p>
      <p>The researchers found high levels of air pollution contributed to five people dying prematurely every week - up to 260 for the year.</p>
      <p>While an eight year old child (born in 2011) could die up to six months early if exposed over their lifetimes to the expected future air pollution levels in Bristol.</p>
      <p>Asthma UK have called the report “yet more damning evidence” of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/10/londons-poisoned-lungs-revealed-survey-shows-quarter-green-spaces/">harmful effects </a>of air pollution. </p>
      <p>Joe Farrington-Douglas, Head of Policy and External Affairs at Asthma UK, said: “Filthy air stunts the growth of children’s lungs and this study is yet more damning evidence of the harm it can cause people with asthma.</p>
      <p>“Air pollution is a trigger for more than 3 million people with asthma, leaving them struggling to breathe and putting them at risk of a life-threatening asthma attack.</p>
      <p>“The findings of this research are stark and must focus minds to commit to legally enforceable targets for clean air, based on World Health Organisation recommendations. </p>
      <p>“It’s unacceptable that poisonous air is causing premature deaths.”</p>
      <p>The report combined air quality data by Defra, with research released last year by the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants to estimate how changes in air pollutant levels in Bristol can impact lives.  </p>
      <p>Analysing levels of pollution across different areas of the city, the researchers found neighbourhoods associated with significant population growth experienced the highest concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2.</p>
      <p>These included areas where students live during term time, Central, Cotham, Clifton Down, Hotwells and Harbourside and Clifton wards, as well as areas where recent migrants tend to live, Central, Lawrence Hill wards, and part of Hotwells and Harbourside.</p>

      <p>Maria Bowler, 24, who lives in Sussex Place in the centre of St Pauls, one of the most polluted areas of Bristol, said: “If I open my kitchen window I am hit with polluted air from the constant traffic jam on my road. </p>
      <p>“After reading about carbon particles found in placentas and the potential link to miscarriages, I think we are just beginning to scratch the surface on the long-term health problems that pollution can cause. It’s one of the few reasons that I have considered moving away.”</p>
      <p>Dr Jo Barnes, senior research fellow on air pollution at Bristol UWE, said the findings highlight the need for “immediate action”.  </p>
      <p>“Mortality is only the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/08/air-pollution-can-cause-baldness-first-major-study-finds/"> tip of the iceberg,</a>” Dr Barnes said. </p>
      <p>“Air pollution, mainly from road traffic, is the main environmental cause of stroke and heart disease in the UK and can have life-long health impacts for young children that are exposed.”</p>
