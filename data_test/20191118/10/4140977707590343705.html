                      <p>The 22-year old pulled off some stepovers before using a burst of pace and tidy touch to nutmeg Kosovo’s Mergim Vojvoda. He then continued his impressive run by executing a perfect heel chop to get past Besar Halimi.</p>

                            <p>England won the match with the score line 4-0 in their favour. Marcus Rashford himself got on the scoresheet after scoring in the 83<sup>rd</sup> minute of the match. Harry Winks, Harry Kane and Mason Mount were the other scorers.</p>
                            <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will hope to see Marcus Rashford carry his form with the Red Devils. Manchester United are hoping to get back in the top 4 and secure a Champions League spot. Unfortunately, a poor start to the season means that Solskjaer and his men will have to put on much more consistent performances from now onwards.</p>
