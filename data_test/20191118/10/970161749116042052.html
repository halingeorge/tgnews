      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lady-colin-campbell/">Lady Colin Campbell</a> caused outrage on Good Morning Britain on Monday <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/lady-colin-campbell-makes-horrific-claims-underage-sex-workers-doesnt-count-paedophilia-11173594/">with comments which appeared to defend the hiring of an underage girl for </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sex-work/">sex work</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/lady-colin-campbell-makes-horrific-claims-underage-sex-workers-doesnt-count-paedophilia-11173594/">.</a></p>
      <p>The socialite had appeared on the show to discuss the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> interview, and his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – going on to make comments which stunned Piers Morgan.</p>
      <p>But just what did she say and how have people reacted?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>What did Lady Colin Campbell say about underage sex workers on Good Morning Britain?</h3>
      <p>Lady C caused the controversy on the show after suggesting that soliciting sex from minors is ‘not the same as paedophilia’.</p>
      <p>As she spoke about Epstein and his convictions she defended Prince Andrew’s friendship with him, saying: ‘You all seem to have forgotten that Jeffrey Epstein, the offence for which he was charged and for which he was imprisoned, was for soliciting prostitution from minors.</p>

      <p>‘That is not the same thing as paedophilia.’</p>

      <p>When Piers Morgan asked her what it was, she replied: ‘Prostitution,’ with Piers hitting back as he said: ‘If you solicited a 14-year-old for prostitution you’re a paedophile.’</p>
      <p>Lady C responded: ‘It doesn’t matter, leading Piers to tell her: ‘It does matter. You’re procuring an underage girl for sex! That’s what he was convicted of! I’m sorry, with respect, that is nonsense.’</p>

      <p>However she went on to add: ‘I’m not justifying Jeffrey Epstein…I suspect there’s a difference between a minor and a child.’</p>
      <p>She went on to address the issue of why Prince Andrew had not cut ties with Epstein without staying at his house, saying: ‘He does things in the correct way. You dump people in person.</p>
      <p>‘He has made many mistakes, you can’t criticise someone because they aren’t as bright as you would like them to be.’</p>
      <h3>What did Prince Andrew say in his interview about Jeffrey Epstein?</h3>

      <p>Prince Andrew <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/prince-andrew-says-let-side-staying-jeffrey-epstein-11165935/">broke his silence on his relationship with the convicted sex offender in an interview</a> on Thursday at Buckingham Palace, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-defends-car-crash-interview-saying-spoke-honesty-humility-11173141/">which was shown on Newsnight on Friday.</a></p>

      <p>The Prince, who was photographed in Central Park with Epstein after the businessman had been convicted for the prostitution of minors in 2010 said that in his continued friendship with Epstein he ‘let the side down’ for the royal family.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I stayed with him … and that’s the bit that … I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">However the interview has not gone down well with viewers,</a> who compared the interview to ‘a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad’.</p>
      <p>Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking when he was found to have died in his prison cell in August of an apparent hanging.</p>
