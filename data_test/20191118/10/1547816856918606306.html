      <p>"I have worked a lot with Lataji. My first duet song with her for Dekh Mausam from Duniya Meri Jeb Mein (1979), picturised on Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh. In fact, Rajesh Roshan, the composer of the album, had fielded a lot for me for that song because my father was a one man army and everyone wanted him to sing the song for Rishi Kapoor but Rajeshji said, 'No, Amit will only sing the song.' So, that was the memory attached with my first song with Lataji," Amit Kumar recalls.</p>

      <p>The singer also remembers the historical show he did with Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar in Kolkata. Amit says, "We did a show in 90s in Kolkata with a jam-packed stadium. There has never been a Lata-Asha show- this was the only one and the same show later happened in Siliguri."</p>

      <p>Kumar also goes down memory lane and reminisces the time when he was a kid and Lataji used to drop in at his house. "Lataji has seen me as a baby. She has visited my house a lot if times and met me when I was a kid," shared Amit.</p>
      <p>As he concludes, Amit Kumar wishes the ace singer a speedy recovery and says, "There cannot be another Lata Mangeshkar. I pray for her health and hope she is back soon."<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/amitkumarganguly81/ lata_mangeshkar, deccanherald, radioandmusic</i></p>
