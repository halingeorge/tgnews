      <h2>The talented midfielder has been in good form for Everton’s youngsters this season.</h2>

      <p>Everton under-23 manager David Unsworth has been singing the praises of young talent Dennis Adeniran, suggesting training with the first-team has helped him develop into a better player. </p>
      <p>Adeniran, along with the likes of Anthony Gordon and Lewis Gibson, has been training with the Everton first-team this season. </p>

      <p>It has seemingly been apparent to Everton’s under-23 boss that the process has helped Adeniran develop into a better player. <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-unsworth-admits-everton-midfielder-17268665">As he told the Liverpool Echo, </a>the youngster has plenty of potential to continue growing into a top player. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“Without a doubt (training with the first-team has helped), certainly from a tactical point of view.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“He’s a great athlete and has got great power and pace but what we’ve tried to do is teach him the game defensively as a central midfielder. That’s something with young players that takes a little bit of time.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“…There’s loads of development left in Dennis and loads of opportunities for him to get better. He’s another player that is a work in progress to get him in the first-team.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everton fans were excited when the club snapped up Adeniran from Fulham in September 2017. <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11015694/everton-sign-teenager-dennis-adeniran-from-fulham">As reported by Sky Sports,</a> the deal to bring him to Finch Farm to continue his development could eventually cost Everton a fee in the region of £4 million. Such a fee was a testament to the first-team breakthrough he had made at Craven Cottage.</p>
      <p>However, he is yet to feature for the Everton first-team and injury blighted his first campaign at the club. </p>
      <p>Last season, he made excellent progress and now the 20-year-old is finally starting to push hard for a place in the Everton first-team. Hopefully, he can continue to develop in the weeks and months to come.</p>
