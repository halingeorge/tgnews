      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> was warned to be careful with ‘big baby’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/romelu-lukaku/">Romelu Lukaku</a> by former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/everton-fc/">Everton</a> director of football Steve Walsh when the striker moved to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils spent £75million to prise Lukaku away from Goodison Park in 2017, with Wayne Rooney going in the opposite direction, though he struggled to live up that price tag.</p>
      <p>Lukaku scored just 12 Premier League goals last season and ended his two-year stay at Old Trafford over the summer to join Inter Milan, and Walsh says he predicted there would be issues.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">The Athletic</a>, Walsh – who was at Everton when Lukaku was sold – explained: ‘It is not about collecting players, it is about having a clear plan and a strategy of how you want to play.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘When Jose signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, I remember saying to him, “You have to be careful with Lukaku. He is a big baby, you know.”</p>
      <p>‘He said he could handle him. I don’t think he really got Lukaku on-side mentally, which you have to do. That is the case with him and Paul Pogba. They aren’t my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team.</p>
      <p>‘I wouldn’t have touched them. Because they are good players doesn’t mean you are going to get a good team out of it.</p>
      <p>‘United have made a lot of signings. Look at £50 million for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Now, perhaps it is too early and he will improve, but my eyes tell me when he gets the ball he is not the best.</p>
      <p>‘He is a good athlete and very quick, strong, and a good defender, but United don’t need a good defender, they need someone who can play, get on the ball.</p>

      <p>‘If I had been at United, I would have said, “Put your £50 million away, go and get Kieran Trippier for half that.”</p>
      <p>‘He is an England international. He isn’t a great defender or a physical specimen, but he can play right-back and get the ball in early and you have strikers who can score goals. It is common sense.’</p>
