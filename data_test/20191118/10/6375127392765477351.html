      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa yesterday signed the dismissal papers of three police majors accused of extorting some P5 million from a bidder of body-worn cameras (BWC) last year.</h3>
      <p>Ordered dismissed from the service were Majors Emerson Sales, Rholly Caraggayan and Angel Beros, all previously assigned with the technical working group of the PNP National Headquarters Bids and Award Committee (BAC) which supervises all bidding procedures in the police force.</p>
      <p>“They have been dismissed although they can still appeal their dismissal before the Regional Appelate Board,” Gen. Gamboa said referring to the RAB which is under the National Police Commission.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIC said that in line with President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s  anti-corruption campaign, the three officials have been subjected to summary dismissal proceedings and may face criminal charges for extortion in connection with the P334 million procurement of body cameras.</p>
      <p>“As I have promised before, we will dismiss erring police officers and men as swiftly as we can,” he said as he underscored the PNP’s reward and punishment system which recognizes deserving police personnel thru promotion or granting of awards and other decorations but goes after rogues in uniform without hesitation.</p>
      <p>Both Sales and Caraggayan have gone AWOL (Absent without Official Leave) while Beros is still in the active service, Banac said.</p>
      <p>“I have found out as chairman of the BAC that three of my men in the technical working group were asking money from the proponent. Sabi ko nga sa kanila, we are trying to prove that government procurement can be clean and here you are setting a very bad example. I promised to the members of the BAC that I will dismiss these three police majors and they’re undergoing now administrative proceedings,” Gen. Gamboa earlier said.</p>
