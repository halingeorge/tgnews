        <b>DARREN BENT believes Everton should sign Rangers star Alfredo Morelos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Colombian hitman has been in stunning form this season netting 22 goals for the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Light Blues</a> in all competitions.</p>

      <p>Morelos also scored his first goal on the international stage after hitting a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4960838/rangers-alfredo-morelos-delighted-goal-colombia/">last-gasp winner against Peru</a>.</p>
      <p>The Toffees have struggled in front of goal this season hitting just 13 goals in 12 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>And Bent reckons Morelos could be the man to solve Everton's problems.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-bent-makes-20m-claim-about-forward-who-he-is-surprised-everton-not-trying-to-sign/">Football Insider:</a> "I'm surprised Everton don't try to go and sign him.</p>
      <p>"He's a bit temperamental, but he can score goals, he's got the great ability and to be fair to Rangers if they can go and get a load of money for him, let's say £20m+ for him, they've still for Jermain Defoe who gets goals week-in-week-out."</p>

      <p><i>SunSport</i> exclusively revealed last month how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4863619/rangers-morelos-crystal-palace-20m/">Crystal Palace were plotting a £20million January swoop</a> for the hitman.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is also on Aston Villa's radar as they look to add to their striking department.</p>
      <p>Light Blues boss Steven Gerrard emphatically declared the striker <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4912382/steven-gerrard-alfredo-morelos-rangers-transfers/">WON'T be leaving the club during the winter window. </a></p>
      <p>This was <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4949527/ross-wilson-rangers-alfredo-morelos/">backed up by new sporting director Ross Wilson</a> who said he would 'categorically' not be moving on just yet.</p>
      <p>Rangers return to domestic action on Sunday when they travel to face Hamilton Accies.</p>
      <p>Gerrard's men are sitting level on points with<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/"> Celtic</a> at the top of the Premiership with just one goal separating the pair in the league standings.</p>
