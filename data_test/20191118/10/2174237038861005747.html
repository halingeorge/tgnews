      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/joey-tempest-s-top-10-europe-songs-that-aren-t-the-final-countdown">Europe</a> frontman Joey Tempest wants the UK’s Conservative Party to stop using the band’s 1986 smash hit track <i>The Final Countdown</i> for political purposes.</p>
      <p>It’s reported the song has been played at Tory HQ to motivate staff during the current general election campaign – but Tempest wants them to “cease and desist” as it’s not a political song.</p>
      <p>Tempest made his feelings known to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tory-data-is-out-of-this-world-f0hxdbjnw">The Times</a> through Europe’s manager Adam Parsons, who said (via the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7692597/Joey-Tempest-slams-Conservatives-using-song-Final-Countdown.html">Daily Mail</a>): “Joey does not condone any use in a political context. This was written as a good-time hard rock song back in 1986.”</p>
      <p>Parsons added the Conservatives had misconstrued the lyrics of the track if they were playing <i>The Final Countdown</i> with Brexit in mind. The UK is due to leave the European Union on January 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/interviews/we-asked-europe-frontman-joey-tempest-if-brexit-really-is-the-final-countdown/">The Big Issue</a> last year, Tempest said he would have voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was born in Sweden but I consider London and the UK my home. I married an English girl and I’ve paid taxes for many, many years. I’m a domicile but I don’t have a British passport. </p>
      <p>"If I’d had the vote, I’d be a Remainer. I’m in the music business, I’m an entertainer. Musicians all over the world, we write for each other and it doesn’t matter what country you’re from. Music is a free place and therefore we don’t want to fence anybody in.”</p>
      <p>Many musicians have complained about their tracks being used for political means –in the US in particular.</p>
      <p>In June, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-vs-donald-trump">Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne blasted Trump for using <i>Crazy Train</i> in a video</a>, while in November last year, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/axl-rose-slams-trumps-team-for-playing-guns-n-roses-at-political-rallies">Axl Rose hit out at Trump’s campaign team</a> for using <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/bikers-fire-hoses-and-looting-the-story-of-the-guns-n-roses-fan-riot-in-st-louis">Guns N’ Roses</a> material during the midterm elections.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, lawyers representing <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/aerosmith-a-guide-to-their-best-albums">Aerosmith</a>’s Steven Tyler <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/steven-tyler-wants-trump-to-stop-using-aerosmiths-livin-on-the-edge-at-rallies">send a cease and desist letter to the White House to insist that they stop playing <i>Livin’ On The Edge</i></a>, while the <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/rolling-stones-tell-donald-trump-to-stop-using-their-music">Rolling Stones</a>, the estate of <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/george-harrison-estate-hit-out-at-donald-trump-song-use">George Harrison</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/queen-slam-donald-trump-over-use-of-we-are-the-champions">Queen</a> have all objected to their music being associated with Trump.</p>
      <p>Europe will tour across the UK in 2020 with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-david-coverdale-album-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Whitesnake</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/how-to-buy-the-very-best-of-foreigner">Foreigner</a> – <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/whitesnake-foreigner-and-europe-to-tour-together-in-2020">with the shows getting underway at The O2 in London on May 31</a>.</p>
