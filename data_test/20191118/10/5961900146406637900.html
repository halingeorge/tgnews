      <h1>Harry Styles Is Going On A World Tour And Yes, Our Boy Is Making His Way Back To Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:14:57+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:14</time> by <a rel="author">By PEDESTRIAN.TV</a></address>
      <p><b>Harry Styles</b> has announced the first round of dates for his upcoming 2020 world tour, ‘Love on Tour’, and I’m pleased to confirm that the most beautiful 1D member is making his way Down Under once again. What a sweet, sweet creature.</p>
      <p>‘Love on Tour’ will kick off in the UK mid-April next year before heading to Europe in May, North America in June and Mexico in October.</p>
      <p>In terms of confirmed supporting acts, the ever-ethereal <b>King Princess</b> will be joining Haz for the European leg, <b>Jenny Lewis</b> for the US and Canadian portion, and<b> Koffee</b> in Mexico.</p>

      <p>Although no dates have been announced for Asia and Australia just yet, we’ve been promised them soon. “South America coming soon. Asia and Australia to be announced in 2020,” reads the caption underneath the trailer.</p>

      <p>If it’s anything like his 2017/18 world tour, we’re in for a bloody treat. (I saw him play in Melbourne and he performed a rendition of <b>Daryl Braithwaite</b>‘s “Horses” and it was probably the greatest 3 minutes of my life. We stan a king who reads the room.)</p>
      <p>For more ‘Love on Tour’ info, check out the <a href="https://hstyles.co.uk/tour">official website here</a>. Feel free to check out his tour trailer below, as well, if you’re keen to stare at a 40-second masterpiece that belongs in the Louvre. The last lil’ song snippet in the trailer is fresh material and, my God, is it sounding stunning.</p>
