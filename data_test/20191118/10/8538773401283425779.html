      <p>Bayern Munich's new president Herbert Hainer has left the door open for Pep Guardiola to return to the club as manager.</p>
      <p>Niko Kovac left his role as Bayern boss earlier this month following a string of bad results in the Bundesliga, with his final match a 5-1 away to Eintracht Frankfurt. Hansi Flick has been in a caretaker role since Kovac's departure.</p>

      <p>In his first news conference as president, Hainer praised Guardiola, who won seven trophies in three seasons with Bayern.</p>
      <p>"Pep Guardiola is a super manager who is under contract at Manchester City," Hainer said. "Let's wait and see until the managing board approaches us.</p>
      <p>"Generally speaking we want the best possible coach for FC Bayern Munich."</p>
      <p>Former adidas CEO Hainer <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/bayern-munich/story/3990888/uli-hoeness-steps-down-as-bayern-munich-president">replaced Uli Hoeness as president</a> of the Bavarian side and said Flick will remain in charge for the short-term.</p>
      <p>"[Sporting director] Hasan [Salihamidzic] and I decided that he will sit on the bench until Christmas at least or even beyond that," Hainer added.</p>
      <p>Guardiola left Bayern to manage Manchester City in 2017 and is under contract at the Etihad until 2021.</p>
      <p>Bayern have also been linked with Ajax boss Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain manager Thomas Tuchel, but both have said they will remain in their positions at least until the end of the season.</p>
