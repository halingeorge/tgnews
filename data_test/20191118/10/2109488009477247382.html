      <h1>US set to grant Huawei another reprieve</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:15:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#kavitmajithia" target="_blank">Kavit Majithia</a></address>
      <p>The US government is preparing to issue another 90-day extension on a licence which allows domestic companies to do business with Chinese vendor Huawei, <i>Reuters</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The move comes after <i>Reuters</i> reported on Friday (15 November) the government was only in a position to issue a two-week extension, coinciding with the expiration of a previous extension of 90 days which was <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/us-extends-huawei-trade-reprieve/">issued in August and is due to expire today (18 November).</a></p>
      <p>However, the situation appears to have changed over the weekend, and it will now grant another 90 day reprieve, said sources.</p>
      <p>The US government issued a licence which allowed Huawei to buy some US made goods in May, after it added the company to an <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/huawei-lands-on-us-trade-blacklist/">economic blacklist</a> on national security grounds.</p>
      <p>The ban prevents the Chinese vendor from sourcing software and components from US companies.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump however indicated earlier this year he would be willing to ease restrictions, and the US Commerce Department is looking at issuing longer-term permits to companies wishing to do business with Huawei on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>At the start of the month, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said the government had received <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/huawei-licence-demand-surprises-us/">260 applications</a> for these permits, and it would soon issue the first approvals.</p>
