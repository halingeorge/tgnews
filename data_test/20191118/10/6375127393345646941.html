      <h1>P1B unclaimed PCSO prizes to fund medical program</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:59:34+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/arlene-rivera" target="_blank">Arlene Rivera</a></address>
      <h3>SOME P1 billion unclaimed prizes from traditional sweepstakes were allocated to the Individual Medical Assistance Program (IMAP) of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) for November and December.</h3>
      <p>PCSO General Manager Royina Marzan-Garma said the forfeited prizes were automatically transferred to the charity fund where IMAP gets its allocation.</p>
      <p>The forfeited prizes of traditional sweepstakes include Lotto, Keno, Six-digit Games. However,  Scratch it Tickets were not included.</p>
      <p>According to the PCSO,  more Filipinos in dire need of medical assistance will benefit from the increase in the charity fund.</p>
      <p>IMAP is the flagship project of PCSO that includes services such as financial assistance for hospital bill, chemo/radiation and dialysis treatments and other medical services to patients that needs immediate financial assistance.</p>
      <p>“The unclaimed winnings were automatically forfeited a year after the winners failed to claim their prizes. This is in accordance to our charter. All the forfeited prizes immediately went to our Charity Fund, where we get the allocation for IMAP,” Garma  said.</p>
      <p>“Our charity fund went up so the allocation for IMAP for November and December almost doubled. That’s more or less P1 billion worth of unclaimed prizes. That includes major prizes and consolation prizes or balik-taya,” Garma added.</p>
      <p>Garma said one of the reasons for unclaimed prizes was that bettors don’t usually check if they won.</p>
      <p>“Most of our bettors buy lotto tickets because they just want to help. It is because they know that PCSO’s charity program help a lot of our poor kababayans who do not have money to buy medicines or get confined in hospitals,” she said.</p>
      <p>A large portion of PCSO’s earnings go directly to charity as mandated by law.</p>
      <p>“At least 85 percent of our earnings go to charity as we are mandated by law to help those in dire need of help,” Garma stressed.</p>
      <p>Garma urged the public to keep on patronizing the PCSO products.</p>
      <p>“Your generosity helps our countrymen in need. When you buy a ticket, it is not gambling, it is charity with a chance to become a millionaire,” said Garma.</p>
