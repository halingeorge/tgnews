      <h1>CNN's Fareed Zakaria gives the backstory on his fateful scrapped interview with Ukraine's president</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:16:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Peter Weber</a></address>
      <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not announce an <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/869677/ukraines-prosecutor-reviewing-previouslyclosed-corruption-investigations-including-bidenlinked-gas-company">investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden</a> or his son Hunter Biden before President Trump's administration belatedly released Ukrainian military aid on Sept. 11 — a point President Trump's Republican defenders frequently raise to dismiss the House impeachment inquiry. But Zelensky had been prepared to capitulate and <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877007/ukraine-aid-reportedly-released-just-2-days-before-zelensky-set-announce-burisma-investigation">announce the investigations in a Sept. 13</a> interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/world/europe/ukraine-trump-zelensky.html"><i>The New York Times</i> reported</a>. On his show Sunday night, Zakaria recounted his "best understanding of what actually happened."</p>
      <p>"Ever since Zelensky was elected president in April, my team and I have been interested in having him appear on the show," Zakaria began. "On Sept. 13, I met with Zelensky in Kyiv on the sidelines of a conference I was participating in. He came across as smart, energetic, and with a much sharper feel for politics than you might expect from a neophyte." In their "brief conservation," they discussed Ukraine's issues with Russia and the U.S. and also corruption, he said. Zelensky seemed "a bit distracted," but "it's a testament to Zelensky's skill that he did not let on in any way the immense pressure he was under" from Trump and his allies.</p>
      <p>Zelensky apparently decided he would announce the Biden-linked investigation during an already scheduled interview with Zakaria, "though neither he nor any of his team ever gave us any inkling of that," Zakaria said. The contours of the pressure campaign were starting to sharpen in early September, but "just imagine Zelensky's dilemma. By the time I met with him in Kyiv, he knew the aid had been released but the backstory had not yet broken into public view," and Zelensky's aides said at the time they were unsure why the aid was suddenly unfrozen," he said. When <i>The Washington Post</i> revealed the plot on Sept. 18, "the interview was called off — we are, of course, still trying to get it."</p>
