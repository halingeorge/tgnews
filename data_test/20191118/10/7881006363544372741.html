      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> The Enforcement Directorate on Monday approached the Delhi High Court seeking rectification of an "inadvertent" error in the order denying bail to former Union finance minister P Chidambaram in the INX Media money laundering case.</p>
      <p>The ED in its application urged the court to correct the "accidental slip/inadvertent error" that is there in the November 15 verdict passed by Justice Suresh Kait.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The facts of another case have found mention in the Delhi High Court order denying bail to Chidambaram. The error is there in four paragraphs of the 41-page judgment.</p>
      <p>Justice Kait reproduced some paragraphs from a 2017 Supreme Court order rejecting bail to Delhi-based lawyer Rohit Tandon in a money laundering case.</p>
      <p>The judge also referred to a previous 2017 order of the high court in the case of Tandon versus the ED in which it was observed that "there is a provision of trial by a special courts in case of 'schedule offences' under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).</p>
      <p>Possibility of a joint trial would arise under Section 44 of PMLA only when a charge sheet is filed upon completion of the investigation and the case is committed to a special court.</p>
