      <p>Jack Byrne and Troy Parrott have both been named in the Republic of Ireland 23-man squad to face Denmark.</p>
      <p>Scott Hogan and Callum O'Dowda are the two men to miss out, having been used from the bench away to Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Shane Duffy will captain the side for the crucial Euro 2020 qualifier, which gets underway at 7.45pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>Here's the squad in full:</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mick-mccarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> wants “heroes” to step out of the shadows and into the light in tonight’s match.</p>
      <p>The Danes only need a point to advance but McCarthy wants to ‘slap’ them down to size as he reckons they don’t respect his team.</p>
      <p>“Self praise is no praise,” he said. “I've seen teams with everything in their favour and they get slapped and that's what I hope happens.</p>
      <p>"I kind of like upsetting the odds.”</p>

      <p>McCarthy is backing his players to unleash one more barnstorming push and said: “They have character.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “Despite the fact we didn’t play well in Georgia, we came away with a draw and we’re still in it.</p>
      <p>“We could have been out of it - we could have been beaten in Denmark, we could have been beaten here against Switzerland.</p>
      <p>“If they hadn’t the guts and balls and determination to get two results, we might not be having this opportunity. That’s why I always believe in them.”</p>
