      <p>Just as rumours swirl about a potential  <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/friends-reunion-netflix-hbo-max-3532155">Friends reunion being on the cards</a>, Aldi launches a new range dedicated to the classic American comedy.</p>
      <p>Central Park mugs, cushions and even duvet sets are all being sold at the bargain supermarket just in time for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>.</p>

      <p>You might not believe it but 25 years have now passed since the series made its debut, reports <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/aldi-new-friends-range-prices-17256770">Chronicle Live.</a></p>
      <p>And, after <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/jennifer-aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> sent Instagram into overdrive by joining up and posting THAT selfie of her and her co-stars, and classic episodes of Friends are about to hit cinemas, Aldi has more excitement for Friends fans with its new range.</p>
      <p>Some of the highlights include pyjama sets emblazoned with 'How You Doin' and 'I'd Rather Be Watching Friends' for £8.99.</p>
      <p>And you can enjoy a cosy sleep wrapped up in the ultimate Friends duvet which comes in three different styles and are being sold for £14.99.</p>

      <p>But arguably the top must-have for any  fan has to be the Central Perk mug and you can pick up one of those for just £4.99 along with a travel cup featuring classic slogans from the show or a 'How You Doin' mug.</p>
