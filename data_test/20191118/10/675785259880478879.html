      <h2>Dr Hilary - who has been a TV medic for more than 30 years - rubbished Prince Andrew's claims he can't sweat</h2>

      <p>Prince Andrew's sweating denial was thrown out the window by Good Morning Britain's Dr Hilary.</p>
      <p>The telly doctor, whose broadcasting medical career spans three decades, said it was an "extraordinary" claim by the royal.</p>
      <p>During a first Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, Prince Andrew denied he sweated when he was confronted about claims he slept with Virginia Giuffe (at the time Roberts).</p>
      <p>The Duke Of York said he couldn't be sweaty in a nightclub in 2001 because he doesn't sweat.</p>
      <p>He has been in the firing line after Mrs Guiffre accused him of sleeping with her when she was 17.</p>

      <p>At the time, she said she was being sex trafficked by wealthy paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Dr Hilary had his reservations about Prince Andrew's so-called medical condition stopping him from sweating.</p>
      <p>He explained: “It’s an extraordinary claim – there’s only three things that can cause this condition called anhidrosis, firstly it can be congenital, which it clearly isn’t in this case.</p>

      <p>"Secondly it can be a prelude to something like heat stroke, where you’re so empty of body fluid you can’t sweat, clearly it isn’t the case here.</p>
      <p>"And there’s a third explanation that simply he had an injury or some kind of serious condition which would affect his whole body, and again, which clearly isn’t the case."</p>
      <p>During a heated debate on Monday's Good Morning Britain, the doctor insisted Prince Andrew's "adrenaline" explanation "doesn't make sense".</p>
      <p>The medic made it publicly clear he was "sceptical" of the claims.</p>
      <p>He added: "As for the adrenalin thing in the Falklands, it doesn’t make sense. Sweating isn’t mediated by adrenalin, it’s mediated by acetylcholine… absolutely sceptical.</p>
      <p>“It’s very, very rare indeed. I’ve never seen a case.”</p>
