      <p>If you have children or a rowdy pet, you might know the pain of finding a safe spot in the house where the Christmas tree won’t fall over, with expensive baubles breaking all over the floor.</p>
      <p>One savvy mum has created a genius hack that will ensure the tree stays in place throughout the holiday season, and it’s super stylish too.</p>
      <p>Please welcome what will surely become this year’s biggest trend: the wall tree.</p>
      <p>The inventive solution, is made up of minimal decoration, and doesn’t even require an actual Christmas tree – meaning it’s super affordable.</p>
      <p>So, how did she design her masterpiece?</p>
      <p>She started by sourcing two pieces of wood to use for the frame, which were tied to the wall, before applying a fake fir branch across each side.</p>

      <p>No tree is complete without festive decor, so the mum added some fairy lights and a glowing star at the top.</p>

      <p>Photos of the tree were originally shared by the mum on her Facebook page, where she captioned it ‘Idea, for mommies who have a toddler.’</p>
      <p>The post has since racked up 3,600 likes and been shared 114,000 times – people are loving the nifty hack.</p>
      <p>It later ended up on the Hinch Army House Decoration Inspiration and Tips, where other mums also raved about the quirky idea.</p>
      <p>One woman applauded the fact it doesn’t take up space in the home: ‘This is a fantastic idea for people who don’t have space for a tree… in fact, it’s just a great idea full stop.’</p>
      <p>‘I love this idea’, said someone else.</p>
      <p>Another fan said: ‘How cute is this.’</p>
      <p>‘I’ve found a good tree that’s suitable for cats,’ commented another person.</p>
      <p>One woman said she would use white tinsel instead, but why stop at one colour?</p>
      <p>You could get several different fir shades and have one for each week of December.</p>
      <p>Or put a tree up in every room to have a <i>really</i> jolly holiday season.</p>
