      <h3>Now the oldest player on Sydney’s list, a lighter, leaner Lance Franklin has sent a strong message to the AFL club’s new breed.</h3>
      <p>Franklin, who turns 33 in January, already had two weeks of voluntary training under his belt as Sydney’s other senior players returned to begin their pre-season on Monday.</p>
      <p>The star key forward played his 300th game in last season’s final round after being limited to just 10 games in 2019.</p>

      <p>Coach John Longmire says Franklin has provided a valuable lesson to he club’s many young players after the club lost 1048 games of experience when Jarrad McVeigh, Kieren Jack, Heath Grundy and Nick Smith retired.</p>
      <p>“He is a real competitor,” Longmire said of Franklin.</p>

      <p>“He knows that this time of year is really important for him to get a good base and so far he’s been able to do that.</p>
      <p>“He understands his footy as good as anyone, he understands we’ve lost a lot of experience as far as games that walked out the door last year.</p>
      <p>“He also really enjoys being around the younger players and helping them out.</p>

      <p>“He really enjoys training with the younger players and he saw it as an opportunity to up his program and that’s a really positive message to not only give to himself but also the other players.”</p>
      <p>Franklin underwent minor surgery on his ankle and glute in the off-season and will need to be managed after playing just 29 games over the past two seasons while battling soft tissue injuries.</p>

      <p>He has been running for the past fortnight, while steadily building strength with a modified program.</p>
      <p>Longmire expects Franklin to be ready to return to full training before Christmas.</p>
      <p>After missing the finals for the first time since 2009, this is the earliest the Swans have begun pre-season training in a decade.</p>
