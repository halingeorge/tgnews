        <b>Temperatures across Latvia for independence day celebrations on November 18 are expected to be close to record highs as a period of mild weather continues. However, later in the week temperatures will drop considerably, according to forecasts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the beginning of the week, most of the sky will be cloudy. Slight precipitation is possible over districts in the east of the country, but overall no significant precipitation is expected. Slow to moderate southeasterly and easterly winds will be blowing. In some places at night and in the morning fog may form. The air temperature will remain positive during the night hours and will reach up to + 10 Celsius during the day.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a large anti-cyclone will form over western Russia, which will begin to determine the weather in Latvia. Cold air will gradually enter the country from the south, with most of the sky will be covered by clouds, but dry weather will remain.</p>

      <p>As the influence of the anticyclone increases, Latvia will get dry and cool air from the east. The clouds will be less, the wind blowing slow to moderate from the southeast, and the air temperature in some places of Vidzeme and Latgale may drop to -10 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>Air temperatures across the country are likely to fall steadily below zero, marking the beginning of meteorological winter.</p>
      <p>Rainfall is expected, no significant snowfall is expected. Due to the low humidity, widespread icing on the roads is also not expected.</p>
      <p>Next weekend, negative temperatures are expected in most parts of the country - during the day, the thermometer bar will reach only -3 C, and at night the air will cool down to -6 C. Only coastal areas can expect to be free of frost. </p>
