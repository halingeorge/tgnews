      <h1>Tories jump to 14-point lead as Brexit Party nosedives in election polls</h1>

      <p>The Tories have opened up a 14-point lead over Labour ahead of the general election, according to the latest electoral poll published today.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> is on course to win the 12 December vote according to the new survey from Survation, conducted from November 14 to 16.</p>
      <p>The opinion poll put support for the Conservatives on 42%, compared to 28% for Labour.</p>
      <p>But it’s not good news for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party who continue to nosedive down to just 5%.</p>
      <p>Pro-Remain Liberal Democrat party remains a threat in marginal seats with 13% in the Survation poll.</p>
      <p>The Greens were on 3% while all other parties made up 9% of the vote.</p>

      <p>Survation surveyed 1,010 adults by telephone, asking for their voting intention in the poll conducted for Good Morning Britain.</p>

      <p>It was the first electoral poll to give respondents a prompt. They were read out names of the parties and candidates in their constituency, in a bid to reflect the impact of parties standing down in certain areas.</p>
      <p>But it’s not all good news for the PM, as despite the Tories being ahead, they are five points behind where they were in a poll conducted at the same point in the 2017 election campaign.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party had a larger polling lead over Labour at this point in the campaign in 2017 at 47%, with Labour at 30%.</p>
      <p>That election led to a hung Parliament and the need for a confidence and supply agreement with the DUP to allow the Conservatives to form a Government.</p>
      <p>Respondents taking part in the Survation poll said Brexit was the key issue in the election, with 34% putting it as their top priority.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, a separate poll by YouGov put the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/boris-johnson-surges-ahead-election-polls-tories-take-15-lead-11169537/">Tories on 45% – a 17-point lead over Labour in that survey.</a></p>
      <p>Today, the Tory, Labour and Lib Dem leaders will make their pitches to business leaders that they are the ones to end economic uncertainty over Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has vowed to ‘get Brexit done’ and hopes a promise of business tax cuts will bring companies who didn’t want to leave the EU on side.</p>

      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will pledge a big apprenticeships program and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson will argue hers is the ‘natural party of business’ because it backs remaining in the EU – as do many industries.</p>
      <p>They will all address a conference of the Confederation of British Industry today.</p>
