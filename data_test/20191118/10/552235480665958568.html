      <p>Saints manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Jim Goodwin</a> says the club are already looking at reinforcements in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>While he is pleased with the squad he has assembled, he believes it’s only right that the club are always looking to improve the side.</p>
      <p>“We’re always looking for reinforcements, absolutely,” he told Express Sport.</p>
      <p>“We’d like to strengthen again in January if we can. I think we need to.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to say in what areas at this time but we’re similar to every other team out there.</p>
      <p>“We’ll try and get people in that can improve the squad, which is the same in every window.</p>
      <p>"If there’s players available that we think are good enough, who can make us better then we’ll certainly look to try and do something.”</p>
      <p>One player who won’t be signing up at the Simple Digital Arena is Ross Wallace.</p>
      <p>While some media outlets reported he was undertaking a trial with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> , Goodwin revealed he was simply using the training facilities to keep fit.</p>
      <p>He added: “Ross is a friend and asked if he could come in and do a bit of training.</p>
      <p>“We were short of bodies at the time so that was more to facilitate Ross.</p>
      <p>"It wasn’t a trial and he’s not back in with us now.”</p>
