      <h1>Australian rugby star Israel Folau criticised for claiming bushfires 'God's judgement' for gay marriage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:49:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">Giovanni Torre, Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>Former international rugby player Israel Folau has caused an uproar by claiming the horrific bushfires in Australia were "God's judgement" for the legalisation of same-sex marriage and abortion.</p>
      <p>Mr Folau, who was fired in May by Rugby Australia for sharing homophobic comments online, blamed the fires on same-sex marriage – which became legal in Australia two years ago – in a sermon he delivered over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison condemned the sermon for causing “grievous offence”.</p>
      <p>Mr Folau said the devastating drought and timing of fires across swathes of New South Wales and Queensland, which have <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/14/death-toll-rises-four-australian-bushfires-16-year-old-accused/">left six people dead and destroyed hundreds of homes</a>, were no coincidence.</p>
      <p>"I've been looking around at the events that's been happening in Australia, this past couple of weeks, with all the natural disasters, the bushfires and the droughts," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Folau, Super Rugby's record try-scorer who has played for Australia 73 times, then talked to the congregation about same-sex marriage and abortion.</p>
      <p>"God's word says for a man and a woman to be together, one man and one woman in the covenant of marriage," he said, while adding: "Abortion, it's OK now to murder, kill infants, unborn children."</p>
      <p>Mr Folau continued: "Look how rapid these bushfires, these droughts, all these things have come in a short period of time. Do you think it's a coincidence or not?</p>
      <p>"God is speaking to you guys. Australia you need to repent and take these laws and turn it back to what is right by God."</p>
      <p>In New South Wales the fires have killed six people, destroyed 530 homes, and have <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/13/russell-crowes-property-scorched-australian-bushfires-fires/">burnt through almost 1.7 million hectares,</a> the most in any fire season since the early 1990s - with summer yet to begin.</p>

      <p>More than 3,000 fire fighters have tackled the crisis in that state alone.</p>
      <p>New South Wales Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said the state faces a tough week, with little to no rainfall and temperatures set to rise into the 40s.</p>
      <p>He said firefighters are battling a fire front of 6,000km, which is 450km more than the distance from London to New York, and are “singularly focused” on preventing further loss of life and property.</p>
      <p>In Queensland, where 158,000 hectares of land has been burnt and 16 homes lost, more than 70 blazes are still burning across the state, with one currently given an emergency rating and causing evacuations.</p>
      <p>"They were appalling comments and he is a free citizen, he can say whatever he likes. But that doesn't mean he can't have regard to the grievous offence this would have caused to people whose homes have been burnt down," said Mr Morrison. </p>
      <p>Cardiff-based rugby writer Paul Williams described Mr Folau as a “medieval fool”.</p>
      <p>While some supporters of the fundamentalist Christian athlete said his fire comments were wrong and insensitive, the Australian Christian Lobby - which led the failed campaign against same-sex marriage - said the media had "paraphrased" Mr Folau's comments.</p>
      <p>New South Wales Emergency Services Minister, David Elliott, told local media on Monday that the biggest risk in the coming week would be firefighters becoming fatigued by the massive workload they have endured in recent days.</p>
      <p>The minister said a DC10 air tanker from North America would help drop up to 38,000 litres of water and retardant on blazes, bringing the number of large air tankers operating to five, and more firefighters from New Zealand will be deployed.</p>
      <p>Three teenage boys were arrested after a grassfire was allegedly lit in a south-west Sydney on the weekend. The fire was put out in 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>Serious contraventions of total fire bans can attract large fines and significant prison terms.</p>
