      <p>Despite supposedly <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-heavy-lowdo-3/">signing a contract</a> promising to stay broken up after their <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/alice-cooper-in/">2014 Final Tour</a>, <i>Rolling Stone</i> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/motley-crue-def-leppard-poison-set-2020-stadium-tour-913823/">reports</a> <b>Mötley Crüe</b> are reforming for a 2020 stadium tour featuring fellow ’80s hard rock heavy hitters <b>Def Leppard</b> and <b>Poison</b>.</p>
      <p>The alleged “cessation of touring agreement“ talked about but the band’s management never actually let anyone see it. “Legally, we can’t play again,” bassist Nikki Sixx told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 2014, but added a caveat. “The only loophole is if all four band members agreed to do it, we could override our own contract. But we know that will never happen. There are people in this band who will refuse to ever do it again, and you’re talking to one of them. There is no amount of money that would ever make me do it again because I have such pride in how we’re ending it.” He went on to tell <i>RS</i>, “And if we did agree, the way we’ve set it up – including this conversation right now – we’d have so much egg on our face. We have so much pride that that alone would stop it.” Apparently, not too much egg.</p>
      <p>Poison toured with Def Leppard in 2017, and <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/new-york-dolls-7/">with Mötley Crüe</a> (and the New York Dolls) in 2011.</p>
