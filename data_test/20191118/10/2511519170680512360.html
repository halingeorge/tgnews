      <h1>Liverpool transfer news: Simon Mignolet reveals reason behind Anfield exit</h1>
      <h2>The Belgian goalkeeper joined Club Brugge last summer after six years with the Reds</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/simon-mignolet">Simon Mignolet</a> claims he had to leave <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> because the signing of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alisson">Alisson</a> meant it would be pointless to fight for his place.</p>
      <p>The Belgian made just two appearances behind the Brazilian last term.</p>
      <p>Mignolet accepted his situation would not change and moved on last summer to join Club Brugge six years after arriving at Anfield.</p>
      <p>“If I could really fight for my place, I might have stayed,” Mignolet told <a href="https://www.hbvl.be/cnt/dmf20191116_04718927/fans-die-thibaut-courtois-zingen-dat-vind-ik-geweldig">Het Belang van Limburg.</a></p>
      <p>“But if I had ended up in goal if Alisson picked up an injury, I would be allowed to push 10 shots out of the box.</p>
      <p>“Then Alisson could immediately claim his place again, and even if he pushed the ball into his own goal, he would still stay [in the starting XI]. What sense did it make for me?”</p>
      <p>And Mignolet has no regrets over his move, either, insisting there were no more opportunities left for him.</p>
      <p>“No, because I knew that the opportunity existed,” he added. “I haven’t thought once: ‘S***, now Liverpool is in the Premier League race and I’m gone’.</p>

      <p>“Of course, I could have stayed with Liverpool to earn my money, challenge for the league title and the Champions League.</p>
      <p>“However, as long as you are not on the starting XI yourself, a price feels different. So I would rather play in the starter at Club Brugge than grabbing the English title as a substitute at Liverpool.”</p>
