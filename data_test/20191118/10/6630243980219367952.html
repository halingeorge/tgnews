      <p>Burkina Faso’s army says 32 Islamic extremists were killed over the weekend in the country’s north and several women used as sex slaves were freed.</p>
      <p>An army statement says one soldier was also killed in the latest clashes as the extremist presence grows in the West African nation.</p>
      <p>The statement says 24 extremists were killed in hours of intense fighting Friday in Yorsala after a military patrol was ambushed. The following day, an army offensive near Bourzanga killed eight extremists and recovered a stash of weapons.</p>
      <p>Burkina Faso’s president earlier this month vowed to hunt down extremists after they killed at least 37 people in an attack on a convoy carrying employees of a Canadian mining company.</p>
      <p>It was called the deadliest attack since Islamic extremists became active in the country in 2015.</p>
