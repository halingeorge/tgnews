      <p>As <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> returned last night, many viewers were concerned over a burn that host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> had on his arm.</p>
      <p>Dec hosted the show alongside TV partner <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> as 10 celebrities entered the Aussie jungle and braced themselves for three weeks of critters, gruelling challenges and camp life.</p>
      <p>During the launch show, Dec seemed to be sporting a mark on his arm - which looked like a burn - that left some viewers intrigued.</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "What’s happened to Dec’s arm? Has he been bitten by a snake?" while a third asked: "Can't only be me who's noticed Dec's arm? Wonder what has happened! Hope he's alright!"</p>

      <p>Viewers were also talking about Ant's arms last night as they spotted he was sporting new tattoos.</p>
      <p>The presenter was wearing a patterned shirt to accommodate Australia's heat, which unveiled new inkings on both of his forearms.</p>
      <p>One inking was an arrow and the other was a rose.</p>
      <p>One viewer said: "Am I the only one noticing Ants tattoos?" while another wrote: "Ant’s got tattoos now???"</p>
      <p>A third gushed: "@antanddec I love your tattoos ant!! #ImACeleb."</p>

      <p>Last night saw Kate Garraway, Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, Jacqueline Jossa, Adele Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Myles Stephenson, Roman Kemp, Andrew Maxwell and James Haskell enter the jungle.</p>
      <p>The stars were given a set of challenges, including walking across a 300-ft high plank, a skydive and canoeing.</p>
      <p>Andrew, Caitlyn, James, Jacqueline, Kate and Ian failed to win the challenges and were sent to the less-than-luxury camp.</p>
