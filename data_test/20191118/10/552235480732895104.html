      <h1>St Mirren defender Kirk Broadfoot says Scotland gaffer Steve Clarke is his best ever coach</h1>
      <h2>The former Scotland international thinks the Tartan Army faithful should be delighted to have the former Saints man at the helm.</h2>

      <p>Experienced St Mirren defender Kirk Broadfoot feels Scotland manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> is the best coach he’s ever worked with.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old was a vital part of former Saints defender Clarke’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> revolution, when he transformed the Ayrshire side leading them from the bottom of the Premiership table to a third-place finish and European football.</p>
      <p>And Broadfoot, who gained four caps for the national team, feels the Tartan Army faithful should be delighted to have the former Chelsea star at the helm and backed him to turn around the struggling side’s fortunes.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s the best coach in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> just now. I think he’s that good,” he told Express Sport.</p>
      <p>“He’s the best I’ve worked with in my career.</p>
      <p>“I used to write down every session he took, just so I would remember it all.</p>
      <p>“I think it’ll come good but they just need to stick with it.</p>
      <p>“He’s maybe not getting the time to work with the players day in, day out as much as I got with him to get his ideas across.</p>
      <p>“But if he gets time it will work because he’s that good.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Despite working under legendary Scottish coach Walter Smith, as well as working with Ian Holloway and later Paul Ince at Blackpool, Broadfoot is adamant Clarke was the best gaffer he ever worked with.</p>
      <p>Broadfoot made his debut for the senior side in September in 2008 against Iceland while George Burley was in charge, scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 Scotland win.</p>
      <p>And while he insists his days of pulling on the dark blue shirt are behind him, he revealed he would answer the call if Clarke ever decided to pick him again to represent his country.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “If I was a few years younger I’d be looking to get back in and help.</p>
      <p>“If Clarke called me, of course I’d answer it but I’m 35 now.</p>
      <p>“I think there’s younger guys out there the country needs to be looking at.</p>
      <p>“If he ever needed me I wouldn’t let him down, though. He’s been that good with me I couldn’t say no.”</p>
