      <h1>Half-Life Alyx Tipped For 2020 Debut, Half-Life 3 Confirmed?</h1>

      <p>Put the pitchforks down, folks, we are only kidding about <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/half-life-3-tease">Half Life 3</a>. Well maybe, anyway...we can hope, right? There might actually be another Half-Life game in the wings, though. That is, if a leaked transcript of an unpublished interview citing a new <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a> game called Half-Life: Alyx turns out to be true. We're skeptical, but also cautiously hopeful.<br/><br/>The online document supposedly contains snippets of an interview between Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley and <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/valve">Valve's</a> Robin Walker, as well an unnamed third person (the document surmises it could possibly be <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/gabe-newell">Gabe Newell</a>).<br/><br/>"These snippets were leaked by a user going by the name “Midoriyan.” Said user has been confirmed to the same person who leaked Underlords, and they’ve been confirmed by both testinglol and Tyler McVicker to not be lying about their identity," <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7Dke__WLzyTzDg1omSrSzy5alzbUhsC8kZZ8anAhqk/edit">the document states</a>.<br/><br/>In the actual supposed transcript portion, Geoff plainly states, "March 2020, 'Half-Life: Alyx' comin' out." Geoff also explained that it would be a VR-only release, and responded to a question asking why that decision was made.<br/><br/>"Yeah, I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard, but as we said, it began as an exploration of VR," Geoff says, according to the document.<br/><br/>Is any of this real, though? It's hard to tell, though interestingly enough, a user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/dxsrto/new_half_life_game_vr_will_be_announced_on/">Reddit</a> claims it is happening and will be announced in a couple of days.<br/><br/>"Got it from a close source (I'm gonna call him Jim) who has been working on the project for a while (also been in Valve for some time, but he is not known publicly) and I've known him for a few months. So basically, the announcement is coming Wednesday," the user wrote.<br/><br/>According to that post, it's a VR continuation of Episode 2, "but also a separate thing," whatever that means.</p>

      <p>On top of all this, McVicker noticed that a bunch of developers at Valve have recently removed references to The Valley of the Gods in their Twitter profiles. Speculation is that they have abandoned the project, possibly to work on Half-Life: Alyx.<br/><br/>There are certainly a lot of pieces to the puzzle, though whether they actually fit together is not known. Perhaps we will find out on Wednesday if, as the Reddit poster claims, an announcement is coming.</p>
