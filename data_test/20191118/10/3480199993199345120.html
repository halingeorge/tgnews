      <p>The Town manager is pleased Shrewsbury have been able to take their form from a positive start to the League One season into their recent break for FA Cup and EFL Trophy action.</p>
      <p>Ricketts’ side have tasted defeat just twice in 13 games in all competitions, a run that includes a draw against Bradford in the FA Cup nine days ago and last Wednesday’s 3-0 win over Macclesfield to reach the knockout stages of the Trophy.</p>
      <p>And the boss believes success in the Cup competitions will help the general mood and confidence around the Town camp.</p>
      <p>“Positive momentum in football is hard to come by,” Ricketts said.</p>
      <p>“I think we’ve got that. You can get into momentum the other way, into a bit of a rut, as in a good few clubs that have suffered relegations, teams like Stoke, where it’s hard to turn around and they’ve been through different managers.</p>
      <p>“We’re in positive momentum which is hard to get and when you get there you want to keep it going.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we went into the cup games wanting to keep the league form going in.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a real good start in the league. We’re two points off fourth, but going into the cup games we wanted to keep it going.</p>
      <p>“A draw against Bradford where we wanted to win but never looked like losing and then a win over Macclesfield.</p>
      <p>“We have the Bradford replay coming up and we want to keep the momentum rolling and in the mindset of going out on to the field to expect to win games.”</p>
      <p>Ricketts, whose side were without a fixture over the weekend due to the international break, will have Grenada defensive duo Aaron Pierre and Omar Beckles available for tomorrow night’s replay at Bradford.</p>
      <p>But skipper Ollie Norburn missed his involvement with the Caribbean nation through a viral infection.</p>
      <p>Former Wolves defender Ethan Ebanks-Landell has continued his mightily impressive form in blue and amber in the three games since his return from a five-week hamstring injury lay-off.</p>
      <p>Ricketts praised the impact of his former Molineux team-mate, adding: “Ethan is a good player, he played a number of games at high levels and understands it really well. He’s good in the air and can drive out with the ball. He’s just a good defender and that’s what you want.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not surprised at how he’s started else I wouldn’t have signed him otherwise.”</p>
