      <p>The rumoured new battle royale mode for Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare has respawn <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tickets/">tickets</a> to revive dead teammates, amongst other innovations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/03/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-has-200-player-battle-royale-claims-rumour-10106013/">Not for the first time</a>, rumours have emerged that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare will be getting a 200-player Battle Royale, although this time there seems to be evidence within the game’s own updates.</p>
      <p>Well respected dataminer Sensecallo listed his findings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dx4me0/battle_royale_coming_to_modern_warfare_map/">Reddit</a>, which reveal an unusual system for respawning players that relies on ‘Respawn Tokens’.</p>
      <p>Tokens can be looted like any other item but can only be used once per match. They work by a teammate dropping a corpse of a comrade near an ambulance and then using a token.</p>
      <p>The revived player will then be placed in a temporary holding area, where they’ll wait for their chance to respawn by competing in a 1 vs. 1 battle with another defeated player.</p>

      <p>That’s completely different to any other major Battle Royale but then most only have a maximum of 100 players at once.</p>
      <p>Other elements are more familiar though, with solo, duo, and quad team modes, as well as player missions and traditional Call Of Duty style perks.</p>
      <p>You’ll also be able to mark objects and players for allies to see, as in Apex Legends, and there’s a new in-game resource called plunder which will be used to purchase special items at a plunder box. Or you can convert it into experience points at a bank – which will set off an alarm, alerting other players.</p>
      <p>Call Of Duty: Black Ops IIII’s Battle Royale mode already worked very well, so you’d expect the same if Modern Warfare gets it and a lot of these new features do sound interesting.</p>
      <p>There’s no indication of when the mode might be go live though and it’s hard to say whether it would be before or after Christmas. Although fans will be hoping that new microtransactions are not added at the same time…</p>
