      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“There’s not much to celebrate though. Momentum is slowing: GDP growth is the most sluggish since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2010 (just 1% y/y).”</p>
      <p>“The manufacturing industry failed to stage any recovery at all, with output flat. Thank goodness for the services sector, especially bright spots like film and TV production, which expanded 22% over the past 12 months and has doubled in size in just five years.”</p>
