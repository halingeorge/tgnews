        <b>Judd Trump’s triumph at the Northern Ireland Open has been hailed as a ‘phenomenal feat’ by Jimmy White after suffering a heartbreaking defeat at Champion of Champions just a week earlier.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world champion was in fine form in Belfast as he beat Ronnie O’Sullivan 9-7 for the second successive year in another classic final against the Rocket.</p>
      <p>It was Trump’s third ranking title of the season as he continues to relish being the reigning world champion, so the title was of little surprise, but White was especially impressed with the mental toughness shown by the 30-year-old.</p>
      <p>Trump had looked on course to win Champion of Champions in Coventry the previous weekend, leading Neil Robertson 9-8 in a race to 10 and with the Australian needing a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/snooker/">snooker</a> in the 18th frame.</p>
      <p>However, Robertson pulled off a remarkable comeback to take the title in the deciding frame and hand Trump a defeat which would have left some players reeling for some time to come.</p>

      <p>Not the world number one, though, who immediately got back on the horse and picked up yet another trophy just seven days later, by beating a five-time world champion in the final.</p>
      <p>‘He’s such a fantastic potter and ball-striker,’ White said of Trump.</p>
      <p>‘The way he lost the Champion of Champions, Neil Robertson needed a snooker and he comes straight back and wins this tournament, it’s a phenomenal feat. Brilliant stuff.’</p>

      <p>Former world number three Neal Foulds echoed the sentiments of the Whirlwind, and claims that Trump is now a better player than when he lifted the world title in May.</p>
      <p>‘He’s bounced back so well, it was a crushing defeat for him [at champion of Champions],’ said Foulds. ‘I said he wouldn’t forget it, but maybe he has now because he’s won against the greatest of them all.</p>
      <p>‘Ronnie played well, Judd played better, and he remains the man to beat. What a world champion he’s proving to be, it’s so difficult for the first-time winners, some players have had really bad seasons.</p>
      <p>‘He looks a better player now than he did in Sheffield in May, which is remarkable.’</p>
      <p>Trump has the chance to prove his dominance of the sport once again with the first Triple Crown event of the season getting underway next week.</p>

      <p>The UK Championship starts in York on 26 November and Trump has openly stated it is one of his major targets for the season as he looks to hold all three Triple Crown titles at once.</p>
      <p>The Bristolian is the reigning World and Masters champion and a second UK Championship title would elevate him still further as snooker’s pre-eminent force.</p>
