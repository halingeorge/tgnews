      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! presenters Ant and Dec have named Gillian McKeith as the most ‘frustrating’ campmate in the show’s 17-year history.</p>
      <p>Gillian appeared on the 10th series of the ITV show, alongside the likes of Stacey Solomon, Alison Hammond and Coronation Street’s Nigel Havers back in 2010, and has claimed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/gillian-mckeith-claims-ptsd-im-celebrity-bushtucker-trials-infamous-fainting-spell-11173444/">going on the show left her with PTSD following her spate of Bushtucker Trials and fainting spell</a>.</p>
      <p>When asked about their least favourite contestant, Dec confessed: ‘Gillian McKeith not doing trials was frustrating at the time but that was her journey on the show.’</p>
      <p>‘At the time when you’re there and you’re trying to get her to do it and she says no, you feel sorry for all the people that have put so much effort into producing the trials and making them so spectacular.’</p>

      <p>Dec continued to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10360802/im-a-celeb-ant-dec-questions/">The Sun</a>: ‘Probably my least favourites are some of them you don’t actually remember, as they didn’t bring a lot to the camp.’</p>

      <p>Can we blame him?</p>
      <p>Gillian recently opened up about her time in the infamous Australian jungle and branded it ‘the stuff of nightmares’.</p>
      <p>‘It was like being in a horror movie, to be honest,’ she told <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/im-celebs-gillian-mckeith-says-20900227">Daily Star Online</a>, adding she’s still not ‘fully recovered’ from the experience.</p>
      <p>‘I honestly think I’m suffering from PTSD,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>A brand new series of I’m A Celebrity kicked off on Sunday night with an incredible<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/"> all-star line-up</a> ranging from Caitlyn Jenner to Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle.</p>
