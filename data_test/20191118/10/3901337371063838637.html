      <p>Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki says he will use the next lengthy break before the national team’s next fixture to widen the pool of players.</p>
      <p>Following his first win as coach in the narrow 1-0 victory over Sudan to claim all three points in Group C of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Ntseki raised concerns about having “obvious choices” when picking his starting line-up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/bafana/mothiba-it-happens-as-a-striker/667625">'It Was The Same For Karim Benzema' </a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Bafana don’t play a match until March next year.</p>
      <p>“We had a technical meeting and we were discussing and profiling the team. Part of the things we spoke about was that we need to have players who can come into the team and help the current players,” said Ntseki.</p>
      <p>“If you look at Kamo (Mokotjo) and Dean (Furman), these are the two obvious choices in the team. We want to profile maybe two players that can come in, so it is important for us to look for such positions. We have Teboho Mokoena, Sipho Mbule and Athenkosi Dlala, but we need to look for more in this position because you need a defensive midfielder to close up the game in certain instances.”</p>
      <p>The Bafana coach has the same concern upfront – and has eyed Preston North End’s Thomas Barkhuizen as a possible addition.  </p>
      <p>“In the attacking force we have Bradley Grobler, but we also need to get somebody who will also be helping. This break I will use it to go to England, to speak to Thomas Barkhuizen, to the club and the family and see if he can get a South African passport because we have a concern with strikers. In the local league, we are looking for natural defensive midfielders,” said Ntseki.</p>
