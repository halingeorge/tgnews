      <p>I'm A Celebrity fans were in hysterics during the launch on Sunday night as Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly took no prisoners.</p>
      <p>One moment saw Ant and Dec mock fellow TV presenter Andi Peters, making a dig at the ITV star.</p>
      <p>Dec also took the opportunity to mock his competition segment presenting skills before he was heard asking who Andi was.</p>
      <p>The presenter had said: "I was thinking, isn't it nice to see a daytime TV presenter standing on a luxury yacht without hearing the words, 'you and a friend could win £50,000 for life'."</p>
      <p>He then pointed his finger in the air and did a twirl on the spot.</p>

      <p>Ant quipped: "Good Andi Peters impression," only for his pal to ask: "Who?"</p>
      <p>Speaking on Lorraine on Monday morning, host Lorraine Kelly brought up the mention of her co-star.</p>
      <p>Andi seemed pretty excited by it, completely seeing the funny side of the mockery before mentioning Dec.</p>
      <p>He told her: "I know, I was so excited Lorraine!</p>

      <p>"Let's be honest cos I don’t think anyone notices what I do, except Dec Donnelly does!"</p>
      <p>Andi had responded to the hilarious moment shortly after on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> too, claiming Dec had made a mistake.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "I think you’ll find it’s £100k, in time for Christmas! @antanddec @itv @imacelebrity #ImACeleb #youvegottobeinittowinit."</p>

      <p>Dec apologised in response, commenting: "I stand corrected! Soz Andi! D x."</p>
      <p>Fans began asking the TV legend to sign up to the show himself, wanting to see him in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Others found the light-hearted exchange between presenters hilarious, glad to have the jungle series back on TV.</p>
