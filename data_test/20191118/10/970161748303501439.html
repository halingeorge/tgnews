      <p>A man collapsed while waiting for an appointment in a job centre in south Wales.</p>
      <p>David Bevan, 65, was found slumped in his chair at 9.30am on Friday in Llanelli.</p>
      <p>He was waiting for an appointment to discuss Jobseeker’s Allowance and a witness said that he had been declared fit to work earlier this year.</p>
      <p>However, this brother Simon, 40, said: ‘There’s a lot of talk and speculation about him being signed off and declared fit to work, but Dai never told me anything like that and I know he wouldn’t want anyone blamed.’</p>
      <p>He told the Mirror: ‘People are jumping onto the band wagon and blaming the Government but we don’t bare any grudges.’</p>
      <p>Staff and customers rushed to help the David but they were unable to get a response so lay him on the floor.</p>

      <p>They started CPR and an ambulance was called while the job centre was evacuated, but paramedics declared him dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>A witness said: ‘I didn’t know him myself, but the man who was sat next to me told me that he had grown up with the guy.</p>
      <p>‘The man next to me told me that the poor guy had diabetes. He was obviously ill.</p>
      <p>‘The ambulance came but he sadly died and they had to take his body out of the job centre, it was awful.</p>
      <p>‘We were all very shook up, it was a horrible situation that should have never happened. The job centre is all shut down now.’</p>
      <p>An ambulance spokesman said: ‘We were called on Friday November 15 at approximately 9.33am to reports of a person needing urgent medical attention on Stepney Street in central Llanelli.</p>
      <p>‘We responded with one rapid response vehicle, one specialised medical vehicle and one emergency ambulance.’</p>
      <p>A DWP spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts and those of the staff at Llanelli Jobcentre are with the family and friends at this time.’</p>
