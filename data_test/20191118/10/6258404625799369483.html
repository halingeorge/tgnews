      <p>We're getting an early look at the Dual Shock 5 wireless controller for Sony's upcoming <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/sony-talks-playstation-5-development-transition-game-devs">PlayStation 5</a> (PS5) game console courtesy of a new patent filing. The leak comes from the Japanese Patent Office, and details the Dual Shock 5 via relatively detailed line drawings.</p>
      <p>Looking at the drawings, the Dual Shock 5 doesn't represent a dramatic departure from the current Dual Shock 4, but there are some notable differences. The patent makes mention of an integrated microphone, which will be used for the PS5's <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/sony-playstation-5-gain-ai-powered-game-voice-assistant">integrated digital assistant</a>. The light bar has been removed from the controller, and there is a USB-C port at the top of the controller for recharging purposes (instead of the existing old-school microUSB connector). </p>

      <p>The triggers also appear to be a hair bigger, perhaps to accommodate the adaptive trigger functionality that was outed in an interview last month. Overall, the Dual Shock 5 appears to be a big chunkier to support the new added functionality, including haptic feedback which replaces the exiting rumble feature.</p>

      <p>“With haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback, so crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field,” <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/sony-">Sony </a>Interactive Entertainment (SIE) President and CEO Jim Ryan <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/sony-confirms-playstation-5-late-2020-launch">said about the feature back in early October</a>. “You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.”</p>

      <p>The Sony PS5 will launch late next year, and it will be powered by an octa-core <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/sony-ps5-playstation-5-alleged-specs-zen-2-navi">AMD Ryzen 3000 CPU</a> and a Radeon Navi GPU. We know that the console will feature a high-speed SSD that is expected to revolutionize how we game and will include a 4K Blu-ray drive that supports 100GB discs. It is also rumored that the PlayStation 5 could support innovative <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/sony-playstation-5-game-cartridges-modern-twist">SSD-like game cartridges</a> to link up with the system SSD.</p>
