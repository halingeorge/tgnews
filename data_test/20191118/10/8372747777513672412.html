      <p>CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A 4-year-old girl became an entrepreneur with the launch of her homemade <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/cleveland-metro/4-year-old-cleveland-entrepreneur-launches-baked-goods-business">baked goods and sweets business</a> Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Mariah’s Munchies held its official launch on Saturday from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. at Our Favorite Things Boutique &amp; Event Center in Cleveland.</p>
      <p>The 4-year-old business owner, Mariah Morning, loves to bake and cook. She uses recipes passed down from her mother and her grandmother.</p>
      <p>Mariah’s baked goods were so delicious, her mother decided to let her sell them to teach her financial literacy, how to manage money and entrepreneurship at an early age.</p>
      <p>Her mom, Angela Tatum-Morning, said the business is a dream of theirs and they hope it promotes positive relationships between grandmothers, mothers and daughters.</p>

      <p>The Saturday launch gave the community a chance to taste Maria’s creations and showcased her treats to potential vendors in the area.</p>
      <p>Mariah will get to bake a lot of treats over the holidays, filling the orders received for her baked goods at the official launch.</p>
      <p>Tatum-Morning said her daughter got a lesson in philanthropy after her launch as well, donating some of the remaining “Munch Boxes” to Cleveland VA’s Fisher House.</p>
      <p>Mariah’s mom created a Facebook page for her business that you can check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mariah.morningmunchies?eid=ARA_6W_aubwU3lB7yqkS0h3u0mVmtBOQesn4Wrc_U2ir0rqPT3WqHibmnUnhoX1R_TqJAMKNNOMqqu5I">here.</a></p>
