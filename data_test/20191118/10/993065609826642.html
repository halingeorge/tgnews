      <p>A female adventurer and former GB rower has run 2,352 miles across the UK completely barefoot.</p>
      <p>Anna McNuff, from Gloucester, set off from the Shetland Isles in June and reached Cannizzaro Park in Wimbledon, London on Sunday.</p>
      <p>During her challenge, she covered the equivalent of 90 marathons and burned 495,000 calories.</p>
      <p>She spent 168 days on the road, visiting 143 towns and speaking to 1,700 Girl Guides.</p>

      <p>After reaching the finish line, she tweeted that she had completed “the adventure of a lifetime”.</p>
      <p>“The past six months seem like a bizarre dream,” the ambassador for Girlguiding wrote.</p>
      <p>“I know better than to try to process it all at once – that will take much wistful looking out of windows and some (imaginary) beard stroking.</p>
      <p>“For now, all I can say is that I am overcome with pride for this amazing country.”</p>

      <p>Ms McNuff previously rowed for GB, but stopped competing aged 23 due to injuries and went to work in marketing.</p>
      <p>She then set off to cycle 11,000 miles around America in 2013 and began running extreme distances.</p>
      <p>During a 2015 trip to New Zealand, she was inspired by barefoot runners she encountered and decided to try it.</p>
      <p>She worked down from trainers, to shoes, to socks before finally going barefoot.</p>

      <p>Speaking before the challenge, she said: “Feet are amazing, complex machines with over 7,000 nerve endings in each sole and 26 bones in each foot.”</p>
      <p>Ms McNuff’s partner is Jamie McDonald, who runs as his alter-ego Adventureman.</p>
      <p>In March this year, he completed a 5,500-mile fundraising run across the US unsupported.</p>
