      <p><b>Good Newwz Trailer Review:</b> After delivering 3 back to back huge grossers this year, Akshay Kumar is all set to end the year 2019 of fans with <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/videos/good-newwz-trailer-out-akshay-kumar-diljit-dosanjh-the-ladies-sperm-confusion-is-goof-up-of-the-season/"><i>Good Newwz</i></a>. The film also stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh &amp; Kiara Advani in lead.</p>
      <p><i>Good Newwz</i> trailer dropped on the internet a few hours back and it’s super fun. The premise looks interesting which is based on a major sperm goof-up between two couples with the same last name “Batra”. As the sperms of our lead male characters played by Akshay Kumar &amp; Diljit Dosanjh get replaced, the comedy of errors builds up.</p>

      <p>The 3:30 min approx trailer already promises loads of entertainment and a great dose of situational comedy. Akshay Kumar is in top gear and Kareena Kapoor Khan looks breathtaking. Their chemistry is so refreshing and even individually they are so good. I’ve seen Diljit Dosanjh doing better comedy in his Punjabi films Jatt &amp; Juliet, Ambarsariya, Shadaa and more and here he looked a bit weak. Though I believe he’ll be good in the film. Kiara Advani promises her several comic moments and it’s good to see her playing such kind of character. Music is promising as well.</p>

      <p>Overall, <i>Good Newwz</i> surely looks like a “Good News” for fans &amp; exhibitors, distributors and producers of the film. The film which is releasing on last Friday of 2019 will end the year on a happy note for all related.</p>
      <p>Directed by Raj Mehta, <i>Good Newwz</i> will release on Dec 27, 2019.</p>
