      <p>MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Russia on Monday handed back three naval ships it captured last year to Ukraine, something Kiev wanted to happen before a four-way peace summit on eastern Ukraine next month in Paris.</p>
      <p>The handover, confirmed by the two countries' foreign ministries, occurred in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.</p>
      <p>Russia seized the ships in the same area in November last year after opening fire on them and wounding several sailors. Moscow said the ships - two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tug boat - had illegally entered its territorial waters. Kiev denied that.</p>
      <p>Russia returned the sailors who had been on board the ships to Ukraine in September as part of a prisoner exchange deal.</p>
      <p>Various Russian media outlets reported that the ships would be returned to Ukraine on Monday without their ammunition and documentation.</p>
      <p>Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Moscow would respond harshly in future to what it called any similar maritime "provocations" near its borders.</p>
      <p>Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the three captured ships were en route to the port of Odessa.</p>
      <p>It said that their original voyage, which Russia had interpreted as a border violation, had been peaceful and legal and that Kiev planned to pursue a case against Russia over the matter at an international arbitration panel in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Despite those and other continuing tensions, the handover is likely to be seen as a confidence-building measure ahead of the planned Ukraine summit however.</p>
      <p>The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine will meet in Paris on Dec. 9 in an attempt to advance efforts for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the French presidency said on Friday.</p>
      <p>More than 13,000 people have been killed in the more than five-year-old conflict in east Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces.</p>
      <p>Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula, which prompted Western sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising to end the conflict.</p>
