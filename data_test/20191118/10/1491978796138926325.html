      <h3>GN Bank, 4619 South King Drive</h3>
      <p>Built in 1962, this black-owned bank and modernist stand-out was designed by the St Louis–based Bank Builders Corporation of America. ‘Chicago is a city of architectural surprises – and this is among the best,’ says Lee Bey. ‘Situated on a boulevard of late 19th-century and early 20th-century buildings, this low-slung midcentury bank jumps from the shadows and commands your attention (and money).’ All photos from <a href="http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/southern-exposure">Southern Exposure</a>, published by Northwestern University Press</p>

      <h3>Chicago vocational high school, 2100 E 87th Street</h3>
      <p>‘This sprawling limestone high school is well-known to travellers headed into (or out of) the city on the Skyway, an elevated highway east of the school. But beauty can’t be seen at 55mph. It’s worthwhile to hop off the Skyway and explore the exterior of the city’s second largest high school and drink in its Art Deco detailing’</p>

      <h3>D’Angelo Law Library, University of Chicago, 1120 E 60th Street</h3>
      <p>‘Tucked away on the south-eastern end of the University of Chicago campus, this building is a very fine work by architectural master Eero Saarinen – even if it is often overshadowed by his flashier commissions such as the St Louis Arch and the former TWA Terminal at JFK airport in New York. The pleated glass facade is remarkable, as is the reflecting pool in front of the building’</p>

      <h3>Former Calumet National Bank, 9117 S Commercial Avenue</h3>
      <p>A city landmark, this three-storey classical revival building, formerly a bank, was built in 1910, when Commercial Avenue was a thriving retail strip on Chicago’s steel-producing Southeast Side. ‘On the right afternoon or and evening, the sun lights up the building’s terra cotta facade, revealing its details’</p>

      <h3>Anthony Overton School, 221 E 49th Street</h3>
      <p>‘A modernist former public school, built in 1961 for students who lived in a nearby corridor of public housing high rises. Architecture firm Perkins &amp; Will created a playful, elegant school with bright colours and lots of glass. The high-rises are gone and the school is closed, but the strength of its design is helping rally a discussion about bringing new uses to the structure’</p>

      <h3>John Moutoussamy’s home, 361 E 89th Place</h3>
      <p>‘Pioneering black architect John Moutoussamy, best known as the architect of now-former Ebony/Jet Building in downtown Chicago, created this house for himself and his family on a suburban-like South Side street. Moutoussamy studied under Mies van der Rohe, and the influence can be seen here’</p>

      <h3>St John of God Roman Catholic church, 1234 W 52nd Place</h3>
      <p>This Italian revival church remained a well-kept architectural asset, even as it sat vacant for 20 years. ‘After this church was demolished [in 2011], its facade was applied to applied to a newly built church outside of Chicago near the Wisconsin border. And this disinvested, working-class South Side neighbourhood gained yet another vacant lot’</p>

      <h3>Pride Cleaners, 558 E 79th Street</h3>
      <p>Designed by architect Gerald Siegwart and built in 1959. ‘This dry cleaners is an absolute showstopper; built for the car age with a design meant to snare the eye of passing motorists. A new owner bought the building after this photo was taken. He fixed the window and cleaned up the structure while maintaining its postwar cool’</p>

      <h3>Greenstone United Methodist church, 1</h3>
      <p>1 <b>211 South Saint Lawrence Avenue</b>‘It’s the only church in Pullman, former company town turned Chicago neighbourhood. The nearly 140-year-old building needs restoration, but still cuts a figure as it holds weekly services and events for the community’</p>
