      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb on Monday has advised the incumbent government to better focus on serving nation instead of getting jealous from ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif. <br/><br/>In a statement, the PML-N leader said that the ministers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government are showing stubbornness by wrongly interpretating Lahore High Court’s (LHC) decision of removing Nawaz Sharif’s name from Exit Control List and allowing him to travel abroad for medical treatment without submitting indemnity bond. <br/><br/>She further appealed the nation to pray for the recovery of former premier, who will be leaving for London on November 19 in an air ambulance. <br/><br/>The PML-N spokesperson told the media that doctors have examined Sharif’s health and medications are being provided to him for minimising health risks, particularly concerning his blood sugar level and heart disease.<br/><br/>On the other hand, preparations have been completed at Harley Street Clinic for the medical treatment of Nawaz Sharif. by his son Hassan Nawaz.</p>
