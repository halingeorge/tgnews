      <h1>What’s the cheapest Data plan for your 4G tablet or laptop</h1>

      <p>Since the demise of the data sharing SIM as a mass market product we are often asked asked what’s the cheapest way of getting a tablet or LTE connected Laptop online. Honestly, the cheapest way is normally to tether to your phone data plan, but many people, myself included find that a bit of a bother.</p>
      <p>So what about a Data only SIM plan to get things going? For those with a little extra in the monthly budget the convenience of a constant data connection can be handy, just remember many of these plans don’t come with generous data allowances so I wouldn’t be streaming Disney+ all that often. It’s also worthy considering a plan from your current phone provider as many carriers allow data sharing between accounts.</p>
      <p>So if you’re looking for a little data away from home perhaps one of these could meet your needs.</p>
