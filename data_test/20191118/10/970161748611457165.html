      <p>BioWare has started work on not only a new Mass Effect but a revamp of Anthem that may turn it into almost a brand-new game.</p>
      <p>Work on a new Mass Effect game is in ‘very early development’ at BioWare Edmonton, according to the latest rumours but it’s not expected to be released for many years.</p>
      <p>In a report primarily about Anthem, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">Kotaku</a> mentions that the project is being led by Mike Gamble, who was a project manager on Mass Effect 2 and producer on Mass Effect 3 and Andromeda.</p>
      <p>That means his most senior role was on the two most controversial entries in the series, with no mention of series creator Casey Hudson’s involvement – even though he returned to BioWare back in 2017.</p>
      <p>Given the time frames involved the new game – which may not be called Mass Effect 4 but we’re willing to bet will not be Andromeda 2 – will be a next generation game on PlayStation 5 and Project Scarlett.</p>

      <p>It also sounds like it will not be released until after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/battlefield-6-dragon-age-4-release-date-not-april-2021-11010082/">Dragon Age 4</a>, which EA recently confirmed will not be out until after April 2022. So fans are in for a long wait.</p>

      <p>At the same time it’s claimed that despite its poor reception, EA and BioWare are not going to abandon Anthem and instead are planning a revamp nicknamed Anthem 2.0 or Anthem Next.</p>
      <p>When that will happen is unclear though, with the companies currently trying to work out whether the change should happen via multiple updates or one big expansion.</p>
      <p>If and when it happens, Anthem could then be re-released, almost as a new game, although the plan is not to expect current players to pay for it twice.</p>
      <p>The plan is for BioWare to overhaul the loot, quests, difficulty, progression system, world map, and the social aspects – which doesn’t really leave much not to change.</p>
      <p>These changes may include breaking the current open world map into smaller parts, which will allow them to be changed more quickly and without affecting the whole game at once.</p>
