      <h1>PNP-OIC remind officers: Don’t be too materialistic</h1>

      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa has a simple reminder to officers and men of the 195,000-strong police force: don’t be too overly materialistic, live a simple life as much as possible.</h3>
      <p>“Great ambition is the passion of a great character; those endowed in it may perform very good or very bad acts.  All depends on the principles which direct them. These words of wisdom of Napoleon Bonaparte depicts the idea that everything we do, noble or appalling, has a ripple effect that could change our future,” he said when he spoke during the donning of rank of five newly-promoted police generals on Friday last week.</p>
      <p>The five are led by newly-promoted Major General Jose Chiquito Malayo, a graduate of Philippine Military Academy who is now the director of the PNP Academy. The others are PMA Class 1992 members, newly-promoted Brigadier General Jonnel Estomo of the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group and Brig. Gen. Matthew Baccay, the director of the PNP Legal Service;  PNPA Class 1988 member, Brig. Gen. Ildebrande Usana, the Deputy Regional Director for Administration of the Police Regional Office 7 in Central Visayas; and Brig. Gen. Remus Canieso, a member of PNPA Class 1989 who is now the DRDA of PRO6 in Western Visayas.</p>
      <p>“Aligned with this rationale, I congratulate the now Police Major General Malayo, Police Brigadier General Usana, Canieso, Estomo and Baccay for having great ambitions coupled by excellence and commitment that have had brought you to where you are today,” Gamboa said in his message.</p>
      <p>He also gave the newly-promoted officials and the rest of his audience some things to ponder: “As you are overjoyed with success that you had achieved just be reminded that sometimes needless sufferings are rooted in the misperceptions of success,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are surrounded by a materialistic culture and get to experience first-hand the kind of happiness it brings when we obtain a specific title or object. You may even feel it from time to time, like buying the new iPhone or basking in the scent of a fresh new car. It’s not necessarily bad to have these things, but many times, the reasons why we crave these things are a bit misconstrued.</p>
      <p>The truth, however, is that success is ephemeral in all areas of life. The smell of the new car will fade. The new phone will be replaced — sooner, rather than later — by a more advanced, sleeker, lighter, and better one. Someone younger, stronger, or smarter will eventually come and beat your record as an officer,” he said.</p>
      <p>Lt. Gen. Gamboa said that “for other people, this elicited a lot of frustration, resentment, and jealousy because it always felt that they need to catch up.”</p>
      <p>“In my opinion, life is about moving forward, not ending up where you started. The actions that bring you joy, a sense of accomplishment, service, and progress are where you should be investing your energy.</p>
      <p>To free yourself from the limitations of what other’s perceived as success is a tremendous opportunity to define life on your own terms. You need to learn to stop chasing things that simply don’t matter — but at one point you thought they did — and instead, you should start to focus on the things that will help you differentiate progress versus procrastination.”</p>
      <p>According to the PNP-OIC, “the fruitless...emotions of anger and resentment should play no part in the attainment of your endeavors and the ability to succeed; those are just distractions.”</p>
      <p>“The more you strive to be better than yesterday, the more success you will feel because progress, at times, can be felt. You can see it when you reflect back on when you first started, and the leaps that you took to get to where you are today,” he said.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIC called on his officers and men to maintain the positive characteristics that they have and continue to be the best public servant that our fellowmen deserves. “Your function is vital not only in your respective offices but also for the entire Philippine National Police as we embark on the full implementation of our plans and programs,” he said</p>
      <p>“Instill in the hearts of our men and women the honor and pride that comes with wearing our police badges. And always exhibit the highest ideals of a law enforcer, committed to service, honor and justice.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that the PNP as a whole will benefit from your expertise and training in various aspects of law enforcement, as well as in the reform effort that we are implementing under the transformation program that we want for our organization.  We must all work closely together to make the PNP truly worthy and deserving of our people’s trust and respect,” he ended.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIC issued those words in the wake of the continuing PNP internal cleansing program which has already resulted in the arrest and dismissal of dozens of rogue officers who simply tried to earn big money thru illegal means including robbery-extortion, kidnapping and other highly-irregular anti-narcotics operations.</p>
