      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 18 — The ringgit closed easier versus the US dollar today on lack of demand for the local note, said a dealer.</p>
      <p>At 6pm, the ringgit settled at 4.1540/1570 against the greenback from last Friday’s close of 4.1515/1545.</p>
      <p>The dealer said market players stayed on the sidelines, awaiting further clues on the monetary policy of world’s major central banks and seeking clarification on the US-China trade negotiation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the local note traded mostly lower against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The ringgit was weaker against the Singapore dollar at 3.0531/0557 from 3.0479/0505 on last Friday’s, depreciated against the British pound to 5.3844/3891 from 5.3446/3497 and fell against the euro to 4.5943/5993 from 4.5737/5787.</p>
      <p>However, the local note went up vis-a-vis the yen to 3.8103/8141 from 3.8192/8230. — Bernama</p>
