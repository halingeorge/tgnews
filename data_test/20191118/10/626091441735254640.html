      <h1>'Royalty-Free' Music Supplied By YouTube Results In Mass Video Demonetization</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TorrentFreak: <i>A YouTuber who used a royalty-free track supplied by YouTube itself has <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/royalty-free-music-supplied-by-youtube-results-in-mass-video-demonetization-191118/">had all of his videos copyright claimed by companies including SonyATV and Warner Chappell</a>. According to the music outfits, Matt Lownes' use the use of the track 'Dreams' by Joakim Karud means that they are now entitled to all of his revenue. [...] Worryingly, searches online show that not only are other people affected by similar mass complaints, but there may -- may -- be an explanation for what is going on here. <br/><br/>"SonyATV &amp; Warner Chappell have claimed 24 of my videos because the royalty free song Dreams by Joakim Karud (from the OFFICIAL YOUTUBE AUDIO LIBRARY BTW) uses a sample from Kenny Burrell Quartet's 'Weaver of Dream,'" a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Th3Jez/status/1195793057620221952">wrote</a> on Saturday. Sure enough, if one turns to the WhoSampled archive, Dreams is <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/682940/Joakim-Karud-Dreams-Kenny-Burrell-Weaver-of-Dreams/">listed</a> as having sampled Weaver of Dreams, a track from 1956 to which Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC and Warner/Chappell Music, Inc. <a href="https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/3694874/Kenny+Burrell/Weaver+of+Dreams">own the copyrights</a>. If the trend of claims against 'Dreams' continues, there is potential for huge upheaval on YouTube and elsewhere. Countless thousands of videos use the track and as a result it has become very well-known. Sadly, people trying to claim it as their own is <a href="https://twitter.com/joakimkarud/status/916926031189168128?lang=en">nothing new</a> but fingers crossed, common sense will sort out the present issues.</i></p>
