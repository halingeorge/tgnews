      <h1>SoftBank proposes $30 billion merger between Yahoo Japan and Line</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:18:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(<i>Reuters</i>) — Japan’s SoftBank plans to merge internet unit Yahoo Japan with messaging <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/10/19/line-corporate-communications-works-mobile-japan/">app operator Line</a> to create a $30 billion tech giant, as it bags struggling internet companies to bulk up against rivals like Rakuten.</p>
      <p>The telco in a statement said Yahoo Japan, which last month changed its name to Z Holdings, will merge with Line, owned by South Korea’s Naver, in a deal to be completed in October 2020.</p>
      <p>The companies aim for a definitive agreement by next month in a transaction that will see SoftBank and Naver form a 50:50 venture that will control Z Holdings, which will in turn operate Yahoo Japan and Line.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Corp and Naver, which owns 73% of money-losing Line, plan to launch a tender offer for Line’s remaining shares at 5,200 yen each — a 13.4% premium to the shares’ price before news of the merger broke. Line’s shares were up 2.6% at 5,180 yen in early Tokyo trade on Monday.</p>
      <p>Line <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/31/japans-line-turns-to-softbank-and-cryptocurrency-to-make-its-messaging-app-a-one-stop-shop/">has been looking for growth through expansion</a> into areas such as QR code payments with Line Pay but has been squeezed because of its limited funds and heavy-spending peers, including SoftBank, which has a rival service called PayPay.</p>
      <p>The merger deal is the latest example of consolidation in Japan’s technology industry. SoftBank this month completed its acquisition of online fashion retailer Zozo, whose founder and ex-CEO Yusaku Maezawa sold down his stake following a series of missteps.</p>
      <p>Coming at a time of heightened political tension between Japan and South Korea, the merger might be the two countries’ most significant economic cooperation of the last decade, Jaewoong Lee, a South Korean serial entrepreneur and founder of Naver rival Daum wrote on his Facebook page late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings will continue to be a consolidated subsidiary of SoftBank Corp, which is a unit of investment conglomerate SoftBank Group. Z Holdings and Line will hold a news conference at 8 a.m. GMT.</p>
