      <h2>Here's all the films and Disney Plus series announced for Phase 4 of the MCU, and all the other dates for films expected in 2022 and 2023</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:45:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Cowton</a></address>
      <p>Now that the eleven year build up of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-marvel-movies-in-order-3679732/">Infinity Saga </a>has ended, we are into a new era for the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). It may prove to be the biggest yet, what with the launch of the new streaming service <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/entertainment/disney-plus-3695971/">Disney Plus</a>, and consequently a whole list of MCU TV shows. </p>
      <p>The Marvel films and shows that are being released over the next few years will make up Phase 4 of the MCU. But as so much has been announced, it can be hard to keep track of what exactly makes up this next phase, and when you can expect to see titles hitting the big (and small) screens.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, we’ve done all the research for you and collated all the titles, information and release dates, and arranged them in chronological order so you can plan out your cinema trips and TV binges for the next few years. Phase 4, assemble!</p>

        <b>Spoiler warning for previous Marvel phases, including <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/avengers-endgame-post-credits-3695678/">Avengers: Endgame</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Black Widow</h3>

      <h4>Cinema release date - 1 May 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Scarlett Johansson, David Harbour</p>
      <p>Finally, Natasha Romanoff is getting a standalone film. In the MCU timeline, this film is set between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, following Black Widow as she is on the run for not obeying the Sokovia Accords and assisting Steve Rogers. The movie will feature the character Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian (played by David Harbour), who has a history with Romanoff.</p>
      <h3>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</h3>

      <h4>Disney+ series release date - Fall 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Emily VanCamp, Wyatt Russell</p>
      <p>Following the resolution of Avengers: Endgame, Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes will be teaming up to take on new foes. We’ll be seeing the return of Sharon Carter, who will likely be the person that Barnes and Wilson report to for their missions. The current suspected antagonist of the series will be US Agent John Walker, but his role is still shrouded in mystery. What we're really wondering is will we see one of these characters take on the name of Captain America, or will they take things in another direction? Find out more information in our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/entertainment/falcon-winter-soldier-3776189/">news article about The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</a>. </p>
      <h3>The Eternals</h3>

        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/eternals_logo.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Cinema release date - 6 November 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Kit Harington</p>
      <p>A new area of the Marvel Comics will be explored with The Eternals. This film will follow a race of immortal aliens created by the Celestials, who are sent to Earth to protect civilians from their enemies, the Deviants. This will be one of the biggest additions to the Space Age of the MCU, and will feature some huge names, including Game of Thrones star Kit Harington.</p>
      <h3>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>Cinema release date - 12 February 2021</h4>
      <p><b>Starring</b>: Simu Liu, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Awkwafina</p>
      <p>Simu Liu shot for the stars and <a href="https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1152745349070675969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1152745349070675969&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitalspy.com%2Fmovies%2Fa28465676%2Fshang-chi-simu-liu-tweets-2014-mcu%2F">asked Marvel openly on Twitter</a> to include Asian American hero Shang-Chi in the MCU, and ended up bagging the role for himself. Shang-Chi is known as ‘The Master of Kung-Fu’, and will be going head-to-head with the REAL Mandarin (not Ben Kingsley’s version as seen in Iron Man 3) and the terrorist group, the Ten Rings.</p>
      <h3>Loki</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/loki_logo.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Disney+ series release date - Spring 2021</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Tom Hiddleston</p>
      <p>Loki has become one of the most beloved characters of the MCU, swinging back-and-forth between being a hero and a villain throughout the Thor and Avengers films. In his debut series, we’ll see more from the God of Mischief in a new timeline that was opened up in Avengers: Endgame.</p>
      <h3>WandaVision</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/wandavision_logo.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Disney+ series release date - Spring 2021</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany</p>
      <p>It may initially seem confusing to have a series that focuses around Wanda Maximoff and Vision, as the latter met his demise in Avengers: Infinity War. Even more so when the premise of this show is that the pair are trying to live a suburban fifties lifestyle, but learn that something else is afoot. Perhaps we are looking at a dream sequence of Vision or Wanda? Or we’re in another alternative timeline? Only time will tell.</p>
      <h3>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4>Cinema release date - 7 May 2021</h4>
      <p><b>Starring</b>: Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen</p>
      <p>The sequel to the 2016 film Doctor Strange will surprisingly fit under the horror genre. Dr. Stephen Strange will continue to investigate the workings of the Time Stone after the events of Endgame - but his plans will be thrown into disarray when a friend-turned-foe ends up triggering events that will unleash a new evil upon Earth. We’ll also see this title tie in to WandaVision, with Wanda Maximoff playing a pivotal role in the film.</p>
      <h3>What If…?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/what_if_logo.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Disney+ series release date - Spring 2021</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Hayley Atwell</p>
      <p>Currently the only animated title in the Phase 4 lineup, this anthology series will explore alternative universes for each of the MCU films. For example, the debut episode will tell the story of what would happen if Peggy Carter got the Super Soldier serum as opposed to Steve Rogers in Captain America. We’re eager to see what other alternative plots this series will tackle, as the possibilities are endless.</p>
      <h3>Spider-Man 3</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/spider-man_3.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Cinema release date - 16 July 2021</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Starring: Tom Holland</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although it was touch-and-go for a while, we will be getting Spider-Man 3 as part of the MCU. The end of Far From Home featured the shocking return of J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons), who revealed Peter Parker's identity to the rest of New York on a Buzzfeed-esque news show. The consequences that this has for Peter are enormous, especially for his family and friends, so doubt that the big bad of the film will exploit this. </p>
      <h3>Thor: Love and Thunder</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/thor_love_and_thunder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Cinema release date - 6 November 2021</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Natalie Portman, Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson</p>
      <p>After Taika Waititi revamped the Thor films with Ragnarok and gave a new comedy angle to the Norse branch of the MCU, Thor will be the first Marvel character to get a fourth film in this franchise. However, there’s a big twist, as Jane Foster will be returning, taking on the role of another Thor - Mighty Thor. We’ll also see the return of the original Thor, and the new King of Asgard, Valkyrie.</p>
      <h3>Hawkeye</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/hawkeye_logo.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Disney+ series release date - Fall 2021</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Jeremy Renner</p>
      <p>Jeremy Renner may not be getting his own standalone film, but he will get a full Disney Plus series. Clint Barton will be joined by Marvel Comics character Kate Bishop (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701501-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fentertainment%2Fmarvel-phase-4-3701501%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2019%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fhawkeye-series-hailee-steinfeld-disney-plus-1203318859%2F">Variety has reported</a> that Hailee Steinfeld is in line for the role), who will be the protégé of the current Hawkeye, and eventually take on the name of the sharpshooting Avenger.</p>
      <h3>Ms. Marvel</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/ms_marvel_logojpg.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Disney+ series release date - Date TBC</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> TBC</p>
      <p>Kamala Kahn (AKA Ms. Marvel) is a very recent addition to the Marvel Comics, and also the first Pakistani American, Muslim superhero. In the comics she lives in New Jersey, idolises Captain Marvel and can alter the shape and size of things around her. We imagine that this series will explore her origin story.</p>
      <h3>She-Hulk</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/she_hulk_logo.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Disney+ series release date - Date TBC</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> TBC</p>
      <p>Bruce Banner’s cousin Jennifer Walters will star as She-Hulk. In the comics, Walters is an attorney for her full-time profession, but struggles to balance her uncontrollable gamma-radiation powers that she’s inherited from her cousin. We’re eager to see whether or not Mark Ruffalo will be involved in this series.</p>
      <h3>Moon Knight</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3701501/moon_knight_logo.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Disney+ series release date - Date TBC</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> TBC</p>
      <p>Moon Knight will tell the story of Marc Spector, a billionaire superhero who lives quite a grittier life than the likes of Tony Stark. Details about the shows are scarce, but in the comics Moon Knight appears under the light of the full moon (go figure) to fight his enemies in the criminal underworld. He's been both good and evil, and has been possessed by an ancient Egyptian god, who grants him superpowers.</p>
      <h3>Phase 5</h3>
      <p>If we look even further ahead in the MCU, we do have some titles already confirmed for Phase 5. <b>Black Panther II</b> was announced at D23, and it will be released on 6 May 2022. We'll see the return of Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa/Black Panther, and Letitia Wright reprise her role as the techie fan favourite, Shuri.</p>

      <p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701501-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fentertainment%2Fmarvel-phase-4-3701501%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fheat-vision%2Fdisney-sets-2021-release-ridley-scotts-last-duel-pushes-back-kings-man-7-months-1255349">The Hollywood Reporter</a> also announced that Disney has pencilled in five new dates for untitled Marvel films. These are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>7 October 2022</li>
        <li>17 February 2023</li>
        <li>5 May 2023</li>
        <li>28 July 2023</li>
        <li>3 November 2023</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Alongside previous dates for other untitled films that were announced (18 February 2022 and 29 July 2022), that now means that we'll be seeing four MCU films in 2022, and another four in 2023 - which is more Marvel films than we've ever had before in a year (lucky us!). </p>
      <p>In that lineup we can expect to see include <b>Captain Marvel 2</b> with Brie Larson, and <b>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</b>, which is back on the cards following the whole Disney drama with director, James Gunn. Peyton Reed has also signed on to direct <b>Ant-Man 3</b>, continuing his saga at the helm of the camera.  </p>
      <p>In terms of new titles we have <b>Blade</b>, which will star Mahershala Ali as Eric Brooks, AKA Blade, a vampire-hunting vigilante. We’re also going to see a new reboot of the <b>Fantastic Four</b>, but no cast members have yet been announced.</p>
      <p>Ryan Reynolds also met with Marvel studios over an untitled project, which we strongly suspect could be another instalment in the <b>Deadpool </b>franchise, now that Disney has control of Fox. This also means that the <b>X-Men </b>series will probably be in the works. </p>
      <p>Finally, after a worrying bout of negotiations between Disney and Sony over the MCU Spider-Man films, the two studios have reached a compromise. As well as seeing Spider-Man 3 be apart of the MCU as originally planned, <b>Tom Holland's Peter Parker will also appear in one more MCU film</b>.</p>
      <p>Whether Spidey will continue in the MCU beyond this is anyone's guess. Sony is continuing to build up their own spider-universe in the meantime with Venom and other titles, so these films may wrap up any loose ends. Or we could see negotiations on a film-by-film basis. Either way, we'll be keeping a close eye on future developments. </p>
