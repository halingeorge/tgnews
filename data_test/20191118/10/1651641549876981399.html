      <p>2020 is going to be a very busy year for Samsung as the company has plenty of product lineups to launch. The first product that the Korean manufacturer is expected to launch in early 2020 is the Galaxy S11 series of smartphones and while we’re still a few months away from the official launch, rumors have already started doing the rounds that Galaxy S11 is going to set a new benchmark for other major players in the smartphone industry.</p>
      <p>Not only the Galaxy S11 is going to have a great camera but also according to the famous leaker <i>Ice Universe</i>, the upcoming Galaxy S11 will have bezel narrower than the Note 10 series of smartphones and, therefore, we can expect the upcoming Galaxy to be more pleasing to look at. It also means that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-galaxy-one-s11-replacement-may-feature-a-4-sided-waterfall-screen/">the rumor of the Galaxy S11 getting a waterfall screen design</a> is false — it won’t look like the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/vivo-leaks-video-of-the-vivo-nex-3-with-its-waterfall-screen/">Vivo Nex 3</a>.</p>

      <p>Samsung Galaxy S11 will have plenty of other interesting new features. It will have support for 8K@30fps video and helping capturing such high pixels will be a huge 108MP camera sensor. The company is also working on <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-camera-app-to-get-directors-view-mode-night-hyperlapse-single-take-photo-and-more/">plenty of new camera features</a> and these include Director’s View Mode, Night Hyperlapse, Single Take Photo, Vertical Panoramas, and custom filters.</p>
      <p>Galaxy S11 is expected to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/new-galaxy-s11-leak-reveals-surprising-details-about-the-display/">feature a display with a weird 20:9 aspect ratio</a>, slightly up from 19:9 on the Galaxy S10. This will make the display look a lot like the one you find on the Galaxy A70 and Galaxy A80 as both A70 and A80 have a similar aspect ratio.</p>
