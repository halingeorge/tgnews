      <p>The Census may seem a bit dull, but it's actually pretty darn important.</p>
      <p>As <i>Late Week Tonight</i> host John Oliver explains in the clip above, the count can affect funding for certain areas, as well as actual political seats.</p>
      <p>"It is critically important that people participate in a Census," Oliver explains. "For a start, Census data is used to evenly distribute political power across the states — seats in the House of Representatives are divided up based on population, and after every Census adjustments are made."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/money-power-fearing-undercount-states-cities-pour-millions-2020-census-n1061961">worry for 2020</a>, though, is that fewer people may be inclined to take part in it — largely because of the news surrounding the Trump administration's <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/11/20689015/census-citizenship-question-trump-executive-order">(failed) attempt to add a question about citizenship</a>.</p>
      <p>"So, what can we do?" asks Oliver. "Well, it's actually relatively simple. All of us living in America right now need to fill out the Census next year." </p>
      <p>He has one final reason to encourage people, too: irritate Donald Trump. </p>
      <p>"Think about it," says Oliver. "His administration already clearly thinks that certain people don't count. So what better way to get back at him than to make sure that you do?"</p>
