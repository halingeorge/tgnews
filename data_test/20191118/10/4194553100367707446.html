      <h1>Mignolet makes strangely bitter Alisson comment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:01:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Simon Mignolet always carried himself well at Liverpool, even when he was a sub during the last 18 months of his Anfield tenure.</p>
      <p>We admired his professionalism enormously, which is why he deserved the fond farewell he received this summer just gone when he left to join Club Brugge.</p>
      <p>For this reason, we’re surprised by these comments – which hint at a bitterness towards Jurgen Klopp’s preferential treatment towards Alisson – arguably the world’s best keeper who arrived at Liverpool in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“If Alisson picked up an injury, I would be allowed to push 10 shots out of the box,” he said, reported by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7695537/Simon-Mignolet-reveals-left-Liverpool-didnt-believe-compete-Alisson.html">Daily Mail.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Then Alisson could immediately claim his place again, and even if he pushed the ball into his own goal, he would still stay [in the starting XI]. What sense did it make for me?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mignolet made his fair share of costly errors for Liverpool, so it’s not like he was never given a fair crack of the whip!</p>
      <p>In truth, we can understand him being annoyed at being understudy to Loris Karius, a keeper who never filled us with confidence – but Alisson is obviously far, far superior.</p>
      <p>That’s why the Brazilian was voted the planet’s top keeper in this year’s FIFA Best Awards, and the Belgian is plying his trade back in his homeland.</p>
