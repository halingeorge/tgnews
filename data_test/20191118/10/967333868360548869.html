      <p>The incident happened in Ohrdruf, a city in the state of Thuringia.</p>
      <p>While “fishing” with a magnet, three children were shocked to realise that they'd caught several pieces of World War II ammunition and bullet fragments.</p>
      <p>Local <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201902171072503802-france-paris-bomb-evacuation/">authorities secured the area</a>.</p>
      <p>Police cautioned against "such recreational activities" and urged people to immediately alert the police if suspicious object were found.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, nobody was injured.</p>
      <p>In June, around 3,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Berlin while a World War II bomb was defused in the centre of the German capital.</p>
      <p>Earlier, almost 1,600 people were evacuated on 17 February in Paris due to an operation to deactivate a WWII bomb uncovered in the northern part of the city.</p>
