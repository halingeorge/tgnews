      <p>This is the moment Liam Gallagher dedicated Oasis hit Roll with it to Newcastle United and England legend Paul Gascoigne last night.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/oasis">Oasis</a> frontman was playing a sold-out show at Newcastle's Utilita Arena as he continues to tour his second successive solo number one album Why me? Why not.</p>
      <p>Gallagher played plenty of solo material from his two number one albums but he also littered his setlist with Oasis classics along the way.</p>
      <p>As well as the likes of Supersonic, Wonderwall, Cigarettes and Alcohol, Rock and Roll Star and Morning Glory, Gallagher also played Roll with it, one of the lead hits from the 1995 album (What's the Story) Morning Glory?</p>
      <p>But it was also the subject of an infamous incident way back in 2006, which reportedly led to Liam being banned from exclusive member's hangout Groucho club after the Oasis frontman sprayed a fire extinguisher on Gazza after the former Rangers star goaded him.</p>
      <p>The story goes that Gallagher was eating soup, only for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/paul-gascoigne">Gascoigne</a> to go up to him ask: "Do you want a roll with it? Do you want a roll with your soup?"</p>
      <p>As such Gallagher is said to have replied by dousing Gazza with a fire extinguisher. The 47-year-old clearly sees the funny side of it now though and when introducing the song he told the crowd: "This one's for Gazza."</p>
