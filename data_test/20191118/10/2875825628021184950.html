      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:56:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Former Everton director of football Steve Walsh has revealed the Toffees rejected to sign Harry Maguire and Andy Robertson during his tenure - for a combined fee of £20million.</p>
      <p>Maguire became the most expensive defender in history when <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> paid £80million to sign him from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> over the summer.</p>
      <p>Robertson has gone on to establish himself as one of the world's premier full-backs since joining <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> from Hull and helped the Reds to a sixth European crown last term.</p>
      <p>And Walsh claims - while the duo were both at Hull - he offered <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> the chance to sign the pair - but the Toffees hierarchy decided against the move.</p>

      <p>Walsh told The Athletic: "While I was at Everton, I offered them Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire deals, when they were at Hull, and it was worth £20 million for the pair. Everton wouldn't take them."</p>
      <p>The ex-Leicester scout - who was on the staff at the King Power Stadium during the Foxes' miraculous Premier League title triumph in 2015-16 - also says Everton rejected the chance to sign Jonny Evans and Erling Haaland, who is now one of the most sought-after young talents in Europe.</p>
      <p>“I had a deal done for Jonny Evans too before he came to Leicester, but again they wouldn’t take him," he added.</p>
      <p>"Erling Haaland, the striker with Salzburg, I had him and his dad at the club with a deal done for €4million. The club wouldn’t back me.”</p>
      <p>Everton sit 15th in the Premier League after a disappointing start to the season with manager Marco Silva under pressure to keep his job at Goodison Park.</p>
