      <p>TORONTO - The union representing Ontario's high school teachers will be releasing the results of their strike votes today.</p>
      <p>A media advisory also says the president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation will be talking about the union's "next steps."</p>
      <p>The OSSTF is already in a legal strike position as of today, though it's also required to give five days notice before a strike and has not yet done so.</p>
      <p>Three of Ontario's four major teachers' unions are taking steps toward potential strikes as they negotiate with the government for new contracts.</p>
      <p>Elementary teachers are set to start a work-to-rule campaign on Nov. 26 that they say will target ministry and school board administrative tasks and will not affect student learning.</p>
      <p>Catholic teachers voted 97 per cent in favour of a strike if necessary, although they are not yet in a legal strike position, while negotiations between the province and French teachers continue.</p>
