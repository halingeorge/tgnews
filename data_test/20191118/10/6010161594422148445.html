      <p>Infinity Ward may have actually fixed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare’s stuttering cutscenes on PC.</p>
      <p><b>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</b> has received an update on Friday specifically on PC that aims to fix the longstanding issue of stuttering cutscenes in the single-player campaign.</p>
      <p>Since launch, players on PC have been reporting constant stuttering in all of the campaign cutscenes, which often causes audio to be out of sync with visuals, not to mention be very distracting when you’re trying to learn a story beat in between the shooting.</p>
      <p>The new patch should hopefully fix that, and early reports indicate that it may actually have. The update also brings fixes for Dev Error 6178, another common problem on PC.</p>
