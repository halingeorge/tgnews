      <p>MADRID — Media reports say a van carrying 52 migrants has smashed through border barriers between Morocco and Spain to enter the Spanish enclave of Ceuta.</p>
      <p>Spanish private news agency Europa Press, citing Red Cross officials, said the van sped across the border before dawn Monday, breaking through at least one metal gate. The sub-Saharan migrants were later detained by police in the city.</p>
      <p>Migrants gathered in Morocco normally try to scale the 6-meter (19.5 foot) wire fences that separate Ceuta from Morocco but rarely try to cross in vehicles.</p>
      <p>Once in Ceuta, the migrants typically apply for asylum or wait for an opportunity to travel to mainland Spain.</p>
      <p>Europa Press said four of the migrants were treated in a Ceuta hospital for minor injuries suffered in the crossing.</p>
