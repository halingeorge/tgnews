      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>The latest inflation report implies a fast rise in the prices of overall goods and services in the economy. The report showed that Nigeria’s inflation rose to 17 months high, the fastest growth since May 2018.</p>
      <p>Basically, the country’s inflation rate which had slowed down to it’s lowest in over 3 years as at August (11.02%) snowballed to 11.61% in October 2019.</p>
      <p>The increase in inflation rate may hugely be attributed to the consequences of the sustained closure of the country’s border since August.<br/>• Hence, the rise in inflation suggests that the closure of the land borders is now significantly reflecting on commodity prices.<br/>• Recall that since the border closure, <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/11/12/local-rice-floods-major-markets-in-nigeria-as-frozen-food-sellers-lament-low-patronage/">Nairametrics</a> reported that prices of food items like rice, frozen chicken, tomatoes and other food items had rapidly increased.<br/>• It should be noted that the rise in inflation may not necessarily come as a surprise as, prices are expected to rise further due to the recent policy measures by the government.<br/>• An up thick in inflation is still expected through 2019 as the federal government has repeatedly stated it won’t be reversing its stand on the closure of the border until the neighboring countries comply to standards of cross border movement of goods.</p>
      <p><b>In the meantime</b>, the latest increase in the inflation rate means the purchasing power of consumers to buy goods and services deteriorated. That is, the ability of consumers to buy the same quantity of goods with a fixed income level has worsened within the period.</p>
