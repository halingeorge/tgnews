      <h1>Deadline rapidly approaches for embattled Saracens</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:29:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Saracens are expected to drop their appeal against heavy punishments for breaking the Premiership’s salary cap as the deadline for appeal approaches.</p>
      <p>The PA news agency understands the English and European champions have decided not to contest the £5.4million fine and 35-point penalty imposed for infractions over the course of the past three seasons.</p>
      <p>This marks a change of direction for the club, who had previously indicated they would appeal against the “heavy-handed” sanctions imposed earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The news is set to be confirmed today (Monday, 18th November), which is the deadline to serve notice of any appeal.</p>

      <p>Director of rugby Mark McCall, however, was unwilling to shed light on the matter as he spoke to media on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Other people in the club are going to make that decision,” McCall told BT Sport as his side opened the defence of their Heineken Champions Cup title with a 30-10 loss to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92">Racing 92</a> at the Paris La Defense Arena.</p>
      <p>“As far as I know the deadline is tomorrow (Monday). My job is very clear and that’s to get on with the rugby and get the very best out of this group.</p>
      <p>“This group have done so well for us over the last four weeks and we’re really excited to see how they go again today.”</p>
      <p>Pressed on whether he was being consulted on the matter, McCall stressed: “It’s not my decision. It’s a decision for other people in the club.”</p>

      <p>The punishments have been suspended pending an appeals process but, if imposed on Monday, Saracens will crash from third in the Premiership to rock bottom on -22 points, 26 adrift of Leicester.</p>
      <p>With regard to the fine, which totals exactly £5,360,272.31, it is understood the club will be given a short period of time to make payment.</p>
      <p>Saracens, who have won the Premiership for the past two seasons and in four of the past five, boast a number of the game’s elite players.</p>
      <p>An independent panel, led by barrister Lord Dyson, found the club had failed to disclose payments to players in each of the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons, and had also exceeded the ceiling for payments to senior players.</p>
      <p>No details have been revealed on the size of the undisclosed payments or the recipients.</p>
