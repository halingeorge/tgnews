      <p>Patriots quarterback Tom Brady completed only 26 of 47 passes for 216 yards and his 14 incompletions – while throwing into a swirling first-half wind – were the most in his career in a single half.</p>
      <p>Both sides were lacklustre going forward, with Patriots receiver Julian Edelman making the biggest throw of the game, finding Phillip Dorsett in the end zone to give his side a 17-10 lead on their first possession of the second half following Brady's backward pass.</p>

      <p>The San Francisco 49ers bounced back from last week's first defeat of the season to beat the Arizona Cardinals 36-26 and stay top of NFC West.</p>
      <p>The Cardinals led 9-0 after Zane Gonzalez's field goal and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald's touchdown, but the 49ers edged a see-saw encounter with tight end Ross Dwelley going over for two decisive close-range touchdowns.</p>
      <p>The New York Jets beat the Washington Redskins 34-17 and the New Orleans Saints also secured victory on the road by the same scoreline at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
