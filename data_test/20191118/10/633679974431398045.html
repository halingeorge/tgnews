      <p>A photos-only mode for Facebook's mobile application is under testing and it would let users see algorithmically suggested photos in a feed similar to its photo sharing platform Instagram.</p>
      <p>The feature, named "Popular Photos", affixes an endless scroll of algorithmically selected images from friends beneath the full-screen view of a photo opened from the News Feed. The result is an experience that is similar to Instagram feed, TechCrunch has recently reported.</p>
      <p>A mode was first spotted in October and the trial has since concluded. The new feature is being worked on with future tests in mind.</p>
      <p>The company refused to disclose more details or its motives for Popular Photos. Given Facebook already has Stories, messaging, profiles, and its IGTV-esque Watch video hub, it's only the Explore tab and a dedicated media feed that are missing from it being a full clone of Instagram, the report added.</p>
