      <h2>Been watching Apple TV+ as part of a free trial and want to cancel your subscription? Here's what to do.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:04:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/karen-haslam/" target="_blank">Karen Haslam</a></address>
      <p>Have you been watching Apple TV+ shows as part of a free trial? Have you failed to find anything that really captivates you? Or is it time to cancel a subscription to yet another service you don't need as much as the food on your table? Here's what to do.</p>
      <h3>How to cancel Apple TV+ following free trial</h3>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/tv-streaming-service-3610603/">Apple TV+ launched</a> on 1 November 2019, Apple offered two free trials: one week free, or, for some, a whole year for free. </p>
      <p>Everyone has the opportunity to watch a week's worth of TV+ shows for free. When you open the TV app on your Mac, iPhone, iPad or Apple TV you will see the option to start the trial. It's a great way to see what's on offer. Here's a run through of <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/whats-on-apple-tv-3694177/">what's on Apple TV+</a>.</p>

      <p>However, once the week is up your subscription will automatically start unless you cancel it.</p>
      <p>Apple states that: "If you signed up for a free or discounted trial subscription and you don't want to renew it, cancel it at least 24 hours before the trial ends."</p>

      <p>Note: When we initially started watching Apple TV+ on 1 November we were surprised that no subscription details appeared in our account. However, a few weeks later when we attempted to watch again we found the date the subscription would start was a week on from that date, so it seems we had managed to get a show for free before our trial actually started. We can't confirm whether you will be as lucky!</p>
      <p>Some people can access a whole year of Apple TV+ for free, so it will be a long time before they need to consider whether to stop their subscription. Read about <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/apple/get-apple-tv-free-3777103/">how to get Apple TV+ for free here.</a></p>

      <h3>How to cancel subscription to Apple TV+</h3>
      <p>If you have been paying for an Apple TV+ subscription but later decide that you want to cancel, you can follow the same steps above. However, we suggest you keep the following information in mind: </p>
      <p>Your contract will be set to renew on a certain day every month. Normally if you cancel your subscription, such as for Apple Music, you will continue to be able to access the service until the subscription period ends. However, with Apple TV+ when you cancel your subscription access to Apple TV+ will end immediately. With that in mind we suggest you cancel as close to your renewal date as possible.</p>
