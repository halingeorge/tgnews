      <p>The trailer, starring Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, traces the story of two couples who opt for an IVF treatment to become parents — but a mix-up at the hospital due to similar surnames (the Batras) — leads to plenty of complications and hilarity ensues. Ultimately, the four have to become parents ‘together’.</p>
      <p>The film is directed by Raj Mehta and produced by Dharma Productions, and is set for a Christmas release date on December 27.</p>
