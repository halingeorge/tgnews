      <h3>Reports on the President’s response to farmers’ plight not clear on suspension of rice importation</h3>
      <p>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has said rice importation would be suspended in response to farmers’ complaints against the Rice Tariffication Law, according to GMA News.</p>
      <p>Duterte said the government must now begin purchasing local rice to help the local farmers who have been adversely affected by the flood of affordable imported rice.</p>
      <p>Malacañang however yesterday said there is no order yet for the Department of Agriculture to suspend the importation of rice during the harvest season.</p>
      <p>“As of this time, there is no order to stop rice importation given to Secretary Dar of the Department of Agriculture,” presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a message to reporters.</p>
      <p>And in an interview on ABS-CBN News with Ted Failon the President apologized to rice farmers over low prices of the grain but said he could not repeal the rice tariffication law because if he did the country would suffer a food crisis.</p>
      <p>“Ang sinasabi ko lang sa taumbayan is that do not despair. We can always correct the wrong. I apologize to you if the result we wanted to get during the early days of my administration has been well, delayed or not good, not to your expectations,” Duterte said in an exclusive interview with Failon.</p>
      <p>Last February, Duterte signed the Rice Tariffication Law that removed quantitative restrictions on rice importation, which stabilized rice supply and drove down prices.</p>
      <p>But local farmers have been badly hit by the effects of the law’s implementation, which resulted in the huge drop in the farm-gate prices of palay (non-milled rice).  </p>
      <p>Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) as of October 25 showed that palay prices fell to their lowest in eight years.</p>
      <p>According to the PSA, the farm-gate price of rice fell to P15.35 per kilo, which is 27% lower compared to the prices in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Senator Francis Pangilinan, chairman of the Senate Constitutional Amendments, Revision of Codes and Laws, said all solutions to aid farmers affected by the implementation of the law must be fast-tracked.</p>
      <p>Also, he said the farmers should be given cash compensation for their losses amounting to almost P60 billion.</p>
      <p>The Philippines has reportedly surpassed China as the biggest rice importer in the world after it imported 3 million metric tons of rice in 2019.</p>
