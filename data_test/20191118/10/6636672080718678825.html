      <p>As we continue to see more products developed to meet the demands of small lightweight technology TE have introduced its O.C.H Micro Circular <a href="https://www.te.com/usa-en/about-te/news-center/adm-och-micro-circular-connectors.html">connectors</a>.</p>
      <h3>Designed with wearable tech</h3>
      <p>In my previous blog post (see <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/electro-ramblings/industry-comment/connect-smart-connected-textiles-2019-07/">Only Connect: On smart connected textiles</a>) I discussed how this is going to become a massive area for growth in the near future.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a closer look at this new connector range. As part of the <a href="https://asc.army.mil/web/portfolio-item/soldier-nw/">Net Warrior Program</a> developed by the US Army the idea is to bring together technology to the frontline that is bot ultra-modern and lightweight.</p>
      <p>According to TE:</p>
      <blockquote>“Our ruggedized O.C.H. micro circular connectors have passed the rigorous performance requirements set by the US Army, including the mechanical and performance requirements of MIL-STD-810G. These circular connectors feature a push-pull coupling and quick disconnect per the US Army’s Nett Warrior specification. The connectors can be ordered against National Stocking Numbers 5935-016595575 and 5935-016594090.”</blockquote>
      <p>The technical specifications are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shell: Aluminium alloy, selectively plated zinc-nickel over electroless nickel overall</li>
        <li>Inserts: Thermoplastic</li>
        <li>Contacts: Copper alloy, plated gold over nickel</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Electrical</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Insulation Resistance: 100 MΩ min. at 500 VDC</li>
        <li>Contact Current Rating: 5 A (-18°C to +71°C, crimped to 22 AWG wire</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Mechanica</b>l:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shock: MIL-STD-810G, Method 516.6, Procedure IV</li>
        <li>Vibration: MIL-STD-810G, Method 514.7, Procedure I, Method 514.6, Category 5, Procedure II</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check out <a href="https://www.ittcannon.com/getattachment/Campaigns/Rock-in-Lock/Picture13.png.aspx?width=600&amp;height=224">this picture</a> of wearable technology. Is this not the soldier of the future!  It’s like sci-fi is starting to look like a real possibility within the next few years.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see how these connectors take off compared with the <a href="https://www.amphenolpcd.com/products/circular/stingray">Amphenol Stingray Series</a>. It’s going to be a super competitive market in the race for dominance in the wearable tech market.</p>
      <p>I for one will be watching this market closely as what starts in the USA is closely followed by the UK, and waiting to be at the forefront of new technology I am very excited about these new innovations.</p>
