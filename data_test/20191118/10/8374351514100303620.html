      <h1>PH won’t halt rice importation—Dominguez</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:17:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author">Chino Leyco</a></address>
      <p>The government will not suspend the importation of rice, the chief economic manager of President Duterte clarified Monday.</p>
      <p>Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III told reporters in a mobile phone message that the government will provide “unconditional” financial aid to affected farmers as the rice tariffication law continues to take effect.</p>
      <p>Instead of suspending the controversial measure, Dominguez said “the grant of unconditional cash transfers to affected farmers was approved in the last Cabinet meeting.”</p>
      <p>Dominguez also cited a broadsheet newspaper report quoting President Duterte apologizing to farmers over the low farm-gate price of dry unhusked rice or “palay” sank.</p>
      <p>According to the news report, the chief executive plans to meet with the farmers’ groups to discuss the influx of imported rice that dragged down retail prices of both well-milled rice and regular-milled rice to their lowest levels in more than two years.</p>
      <p>Duterte was also quoted as saying that his administration does not intend to seek the repeal of the rice tariffication law.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, GMA News’ 24-Oras Weekend reported Sunday that President Duterte has ordered the suspension of rice importation amid farmers’ woes.</p>
