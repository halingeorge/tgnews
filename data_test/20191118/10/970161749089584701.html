      <p>Police are trying to track down a man in connection with a series of sex assaults on buses in London.</p>
      <p>They said a string of women aged between 23 and 62 were touched inappropriately while travelling on buses in the east and north of the city.</p>
      <p>All of them were left ‘very upset and shocked’ by the incidents between July 4 and September 25.</p>
      <p>PC Chris Bowman said: ‘We clearly need to find whoever is responsible for these assaults, and I would like to thank the women for coming forward to report them.</p>
      <p>‘Although our public transport system is generally safe, this does not diminish the fact that one such offence is one too many. Under no circumstances will this offending be tolerated and this linked series is being investigated using as many resources as possible.</p>
      <p>‘It is imperative women in London should be able to board public transport without fear of being targeted.</p>
