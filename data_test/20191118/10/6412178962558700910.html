        <b>Former Everton director of football Steve Walsh has claimed that the club turned down the possibility of signing Harry Maguire and Andy Robertson for just £20million.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/harry-maguire"><b>Maguire</b></a> joined Manchester United in the summer for £80million from Leicester City, while <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/andrew-robertson"><b>Robertson</b></a> signed for Liverpool from Hull in 2017 for just £8m before going on to win the Champions League with the Reds last term.</p>
      <p>And Walsh, who was replaced by Marcel Brands at Goodison Park in May 2018, claims he offered <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/everton"><b>Everton</b></a> a chance to sign the duo for only £20m, while current Man Utd and City target Erling Haaland was also suggested.</p>
      <p>Walsh told <i>The Athletic</i>: “While I was at Everton, I offered them Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire deals, when they were at Hull, and it was worth £20 million for the pair. Everton wouldn’t take them.</p>
      <p>“I had a deal done for Jonny Evans too before he came to Leicester, but again they wouldn’t take him. Erling Haaland, the striker with Salzburg, I had him and his dad at the club with a deal done for £3.4m (€4m). The club wouldn’t back me.”</p>
