        <b>Bollywood actress Zareen Khan was recently quizzed about her favourite Bigg Boss 13 contestant during an AMA session, she conducted on her Instagram, to which she revealed that it’s Sidharth Shukla!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bollywood actress Zareen Khan had once topped the list of all the speculated names for Bigg Boss 13; however, she soon denied her entry into the controversial show. Fast forward to now, it has been a month since Bigg Boss 13 kick-started and is doing well among the viewers, as well the TRP charts. And other than all its regular audiences, it looks like Bigg Boss 13 has kept the Veer actress hooked as well, so much so, that she has a hot favourite too and no prize for guessing who it is! <b>(ALSO READ -<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-evicted-contestant-arhaan-khan-on-rashami-desai-i-am-in-love-want-to-go-inside-to-propose-to-her/5dd2433687fb571eff7e4004"> Bigg Boss 13: Evicted Contestant Arhaan Khan On Rashami Desai, ‘I Am In Love, Want To Go Inside To Propose To Her’</a>)</b></p>
      <p>It was during her question and answer session with fans that Zareen Khan revealed her favourite contestant in Bigg Boss 13. The actress shared that it’s Sidharth Shukla, who’s among one of the most talked-about housemates of the show right now. She also shared a good-looking picture of the Balika Vadhu actor. Well, Shukla is a hot favourite of many celebrities, including a lot of ex Bigg Boss contestants like Dolly Bindra, Kamya Panjabi, Kushal Tandon and Kishwer Merchant among many others. In fact, a lot of them believe that the show is running successfully only due to his antics, which makes him everyone’s target in the house.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the day, we had a chat with Shehnaaz Gill’s father, who revealed that he felt how his daughter had a soft corner for Paras Chhabra. “In the first week, we saw him and Shehnaaz sitting on the red sofa. But when Paras saw that she is getting serious for him, he clarified it to her that he is already committed to someone. And I really liked that about him. Though the makers didn't air this conversation of them on TV, in one of the episodes last week, I saw Paras saying ‘Maine toh Shehnaaz ko pehle hi bol diya tha mera bahar connection hai’,” said Santok Singh. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-shehnaaz-gill-s-father-santok-singh-on-her-romantic-connection-with-paras-chhabra-woh-usko-dil-se-chahti-thi-exclusive/5dd2540087fb571eff7e402c"><b>Read the full conversation here</b></a>.</p>
