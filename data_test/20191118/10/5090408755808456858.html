        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> threw some shade at his former <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/one-direction">One Direction</a> bandmate <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/zayn-malik">Zayn Malik</a> during his opening monologue as he hosted NBC’s <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/saturday-night-live">“Saturday Night Live”</a> on November 16.</li>
        <li>Styles teased a One Direction reunion on the show (which didn’t happen), before saying: “I love those guys. They’re my brothers: Niall [Horan], Liam [Payne], Louis [Tomlinson].”</li>
        <li>Styles then paused in thought and said: “And uhh, Ringo.”</li>
        <li>Malik left the band in 2015, saying at the time he had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/onedirectionmusic/posts/869295683125227">“four friends for life,”</a> but later telling press he <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zayn-malik-cover-profile-2018">“didn’t make any friends from the band”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGmjqEGB2LY">“never really wanted to be there.”</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gq-hype/article/liam-payne-interview-2019">Payne told GQ this year</a> that Malik “didn’t even say goodbye” when he left, and that they “haven’t really heard from him since.”</li>
