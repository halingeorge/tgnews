      <p>The band are heading to Gordon’s Jazz Club on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>Jane Mulholland from the club said: “It’s a sure-fire recipe for an evening of fantastic music and good-natured fun.</p>
      <p>“Their collective pedigree is extensive including performing with local, national and international jazz bands and soloists, and a wide-ranging repertoire from the early jazz period through to the classics of the great American songbook.”</p>
      <p>Gordon's Jazz Club presents traditional and New Orleans Jazz on the third Wednesday of every month from 7:30pm until 10:00pm at the Magelake Pavilion, Uffculme, EX15 3DP. Tickets cost £7.</p>
