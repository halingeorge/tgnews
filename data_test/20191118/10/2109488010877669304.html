      <p>Bharti Airtel accused creditors charged with selling-off assets from bankrupt rival Reliance Communications (RCom) of being extremely unfair and biased as it withdrew a bid to acquire spectrum from the defunct operator, <i>Business Standard</i> reported.</p>
      <p>In a letter to the committee conducting the sealed auction, Bharti Airtel finance director Harjeet Kohli slammed a decision to extend the bidding deadline by 10 days on request of another interested party, when its similar attempt had been turned down.</p>
      <p>The operator and infrastructure affiliate Bharti Infratel had already submitted its bids, alongside other parties, when the committee decided to extend the deadline by ten days to 25 November.</p>
      <p>Although Kohli did not specify which rival had successfully negotiated a later deadline, last week it was widely reported in India Reliance Jio had sought an extension.</p>
      <p>Prior to <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/rcom-to-begin-insolvency-proceedings/">falling into the insolvency process</a> RCom had been on the verge of selling tower, fibre and spectrum assets to Reliance Jio as part of a plan to cut its huge debt pile. However, after lengthy wrangling with regulators the potential buyer walked away.</p>
      <p>As insolvency professionals continue the process of dismantling RComâ€™s telecoms business, <i>Economic Times</i> reported its chairman Anil Ambani had formally resigned from his post.</p>
