      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lord-sugar">Lord Sugar</a> has been accused of making an offensive comment that was reportedly cut from the latest episode of <i>The Apprentice</i>.</p>
      <p>The businessman – apparently referring to Venezuela's economic crisis – allegedly told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-2019-episode-7-jemelin-artigas-fired-lord-alan-sugar-ryan-mark-thomas-a9201471.html">fired contestant Jemelin Artigas</a>: “No wonder your country is in a state – it’s because it’s full of people like you.”</p>
      <p>Hours after the initial report in <i><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361506/the-apprentice-lorg-sugar-race-row/">The Sun</a>,</i> , Artigas – who lost last week’s task – said on Twitter: “He did make this comment.”</p>
      <p>Following the accusation, candidate Lottie Lion jumped to Lord Sugar’s defence on Twitter, writing: “I’m so fed up with fake news. On <i>The Apprentice</i>, if you were fired, it’s because you were performing poorly, not the colour of your skin.”</p>
      <p>She told her followers that Sugar “did not make this comment,” adding: “People who are desperate for money and sell ‘stories’ are the lowest.”</p>
      <p>Jemelin responded: “How dare you! Comment on something doesn’t even concern you. Attention seeking like you! He did make this comment and however I did not sell this story it did happened now you will get exposed for who you are! [sic].”</p>
      <p>A source previously told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361506/the-apprentice-lorg-sugar-race-row/"><i>The Sun</i></a> that Jemelin, who moved to the UK when she was 16, “felt bullied and picked out because she is an immigrant”. </p>
      <p><i>The Independent</i> has contacted the BBC and Lord Sugar for comment.</p>
      <p>Last year, Lord Sugar <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-sugar-tweet-senegal-team-racist-bbc-apprentice-a8407671.html">deleted a tweet</a> about the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Senegal">Senegal</a> national football team which he claimed had been misinterpreted.</p>
      <p>He posted picture of the team edited to include handbags and sunglasses laid out on sheets, with the caption: “I recognise some of these guys from the beach in Marbella. Multi tasking resourceful chaps.”</p>
      <p>The star of the BBC reality series, 71, responded to criticism of the post by saying: ”I cant see what I have to apologise for .... you are OTT ... its a bloody joke.”</p>
      <p>Following her firing, Jemelin <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-2019-episode-7-jemelin-artigas-fired-lord-alan-sugar-ryan-mark-thomas-a9201471.html">told <i>The Independent</i></a> that she “couldn’t see [herself] as Lord Sugar’s business partner” as she lacked the “chemistry” other candidates had with him.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Lottie and Jemelin have clashed on social media. The latter <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-2019-lottie-lion-jemelin-artigas-racist-bbc-a9178981.html">previously criticised</a> Lottie for her involvement in a race row, in which she allegedly referred to former contestant <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-apprentice-2019-episode-4-lubna-farhan-fired-lord-alan-sugar-lottie-lion-a9167836.html">Lubna Farhan</a> as “Gandhi”.</p>
