      <p>Looking for a way to drown out the family drama this holiday season? Or help someone else do the same? These <a href="https://zdcs.link/jVMPL">HyperSonic True Wireless Headphones</a> should do the trick – and they're on sale ahead of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/jVMPL"><u>HyperSonic Headphones</u></a> are made to flow wherever you go. They casually mix the convenience of truly wireless earbuds with the pillowy softness of over-hear headphones to drown out the noise and deliver premium audio. They feature the exclusive LinearFlux DL01 Immersive Sound Engine, wirelessly tuned to popular HD streaming services by Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora. So, you can easily tune out the same old political arguments and tune into your favorite curated playlists, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-new-podcasts-of-2018/">podcasts</a>, or whatever else you can find.  </p>
      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/jVMPL">These sleek and sporty buds</a> also come equipped with an IPX7 water-resistant rating, just in case you need to escape the madness while it is raining. Plus, they'll last you up to eight hours on a single charge, or 20 hours with the included Qi-compatible charging case. In other words, they'll last until every last family member goes home – including uncle Jerry, who is <i>still</i> ranting about Hillary's emails.</p>
      <p>These truly wireless headphones typically cost $120 but are on sale now for $97. Plus, if you use the code <b>BFSAVE15</b>, you can slash an extra 15% off the sale price, knocking them <a href="https://zdcs.link/jVMPL">down to just $82.45</a>.</p>
