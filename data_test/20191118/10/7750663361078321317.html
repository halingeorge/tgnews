      <h1>Denis Zakaria agent rules January move to Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>The agent of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/borussia-monchengladbach/"><b>Borussia Monchengladbach</b></a> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/denis-zakaria/"><b>Denis Zakaria</b></a> has ruled out a January switch to the Premier League.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:25:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:25</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Plant</a></address>
      <p>Zakaria has played an instrumental part during the early months of the campaign, helping Monchengladbach to the top of the Bundesliga standings.</p>
      <p>Despite the Switzerland international's form allegedly resulting in interest from the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mathieu-beda/"><b>Mathieu Beda</b></a> has insisted that the 22-year-old will not contemplate departing the German side at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>Beda told <i>Bild</i>: "Denis will not leave Borussia in the winter, a change is 100 per cent excluded."</p>
      <p>"Denis is in very good shape in Gladbach and has been playing really well for weeks, but he still has more potential and he wants to show that in Gladbach now instead of dealing with a change."</p>
      <p>Zakaria has a contract at Monchengladbach until the end of 2021-22.</p>
