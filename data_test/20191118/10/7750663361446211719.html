      <h1>Manchester United 'confident of keeping Tahith Chong'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> reportedly remain confident that they will be able to retain the services of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tahith-chong/"><b>Tahith Chong</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Despite the academy graduate being highly regarded at Old Trafford, the Dutchman has been provided with just four outings in the first team this season.</p>
      <p>At a time when he has less than a year remaining on his contract, Chong is now considering his options, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> said to be among the teams monitoring the situation.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Metro</i>, United still feel that the 19-year-old will choose to pen fresh terms before the end of the current campaign.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that United feel that Chong has gained important experience during the opening four months of the campaign, while the plan is to give him more minutes in the near future.</p>
      <p>Should he not agree a new deal before the end of the year, Chong will be able to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs.</p>
