      <h1>France bridge collapse: Girl, 15, killed and several missing near Toulouse</h1>
      <h2>The bridge connects the towns of Mirepoix-sur-Tarn and Bessieres, north of Toulouse, and a desperate search has begun to find the missing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:01:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, Peter Allen, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>A teenage girl has been killed and four other people are missing after a suspension bridge collapsed into freezing water in France.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old had been in a car with her mother when the 150-metre-long bridge, over the River Tarn, gave way and plunged into the water.</p>
      <p>The mum was rescued from the sinking car and screamed that her daughter was still inside, said witness Eric Bonnin, who owns a restaurant overlooking the bridge, around 20 miles north of Toulouse.</p>
      <p>The structure connects the towns of Mirepoix-sur-Tarn and Bessieres.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said it sounded like an "explosion" or a "thunderclap" when at least one truck and two cars plunged into the river at about 8am local time.</p>

      <p>The teen's mother was pulled alive from the car by rescuers, some of whom were badly injured as they saved four people.</p>
      <p>Her daughter's body was recovered from the river, which is 65ft deep at the bridge, and two people were said to be in a life-threatening condition.</p>
      <p>A lorry had just driven onto the bridge, which is in a popular tourist area, when it collapsed.</p>
      <p>Mr Bonnin said: "I’m in deep shock, it's horrible to think about it.</p>
      <p>"I’d just opened the kitchen door, when I heard a huge noise, like an explosion.</p>
      <p>"I thought a plane had broken the sound barrier. I looked out the window and shouted 'Oh no, the bridge has broken'."</p>
      <p>A witness, who lives near the bridge, told BFMTV: "We heard like a huge thunderclap."</p>
      <p>The resident added: "I went outside and saw the bridge collapse with a car half out of the water." </p>

      <p>By Monday afternoon, a car bonnet could be seen sticking out of the water as helicopters circled overhead and emergency workers in inflatable boats searched for survivors.</p>
      <p>A number of witnesses were rushed to hospital after diving into the river to try to save the victims and getting into difficulties.</p>
      <p>More than 60 emergency workers are at the scene this morning and an investigation has been launched, according to the head of the Haute-Garonne department Georges Meric.</p>
      <p>The bridge dated back to 1931, had a load limit of 19 tonnes and was "regularly checked", Guyot said.</p>
      <p>It was renovated in 2003.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Haute-Garonne department council said the bridge had undergone a ‘thorough inspection in 2017’, and it had shown ‘no structural problem’.</p>
      <p>Mirepoix-sur-Tarn mayor Eric Oget described the bridge as a ‘very important crossing point’ for people going to work in Toulouse..</p>
      <p>Mr Oget said articulated lorries were not allowed onto the bridge but that some had nonetheless been seen crossing over in the past.</p>
      <p>He said he had no information on whether the fallen truck exceeded the allowed weight.</p>
      <p>In September last year France’s Ministry of Transport released a report that concluded that out of France’s 164 largest bridges, 23 were in need of urgent repair.</p>
      <p>But Mr Oget  said the suspension bridge at Mirepoix-sur-Tarn was not on the list of bridges in need of urgent repair and had not been not under close watch.</p>
