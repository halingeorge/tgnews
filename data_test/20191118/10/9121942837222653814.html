      <p>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) — Oregon State University will use a $3.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation to study pollution from tiny plastics and its impact on aquatic life.</p>
      <p>The university said Monday that scientists will develop tools and methods for evaluating micro- and nanoplastics in everything from the ocean to estuaries.</p>
      <p>Research will focus on the impact of tiny plastics on an estuary fish called the inland silversides and on oyster larvae off the Oregon coast.</p>
      <p>Another goal of the project is establishing a Pacific Northwest Consortium on Plastics.</p>
      <p>That group would include government agencies, non-governmental organizations and grassroots groups to encourage the reduction of marine pollution.</p>
      <p>Results of OSU’s plastics research will be displayed at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland the future.</p>
