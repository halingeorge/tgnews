      <p>TV's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> has raged at <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> for taking a swipe at him on last night's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> launch.</p>
      <p>The presenting duo returned to our screens on Sunday for the new series of the show as 10 new celebrities entered the Aussie jungle.</p>
      <p>And they couldn't resist poking fun at Piers when they introduced his <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> co-star Kate Garraway as a campmate.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Dec told viewers that Kate would be facing the "most harrowing ordeal of her entire life".</p>
      <p>Ant then quipped: "But before she goes back to work with Piers Morgan, she's got three weeks in the jungle!"</p>
      <p>Speaking on Monday morning's Good Morning Britain, Piers took aim at the duo.</p>
      <p>He said: "It took Ant and Dec about three seconds (to mention me)."</p>
      <p>Susanna first said: "They couldn't afford you so they mention you at every opportunity."</p>

      <p>Putting on a Geordie accent, Piers said: "It's so good to have him [Ant] back."</p>
      <p>Susanna added: "Funny thing is, you rarely work with Kate Garraway," to which Piers continued: "I've literally worked with Kate Garraway three times in four years and one of those was a mistake because I didn't realise it was a Bank Holiday."</p>
      <aside>They couldn't afford you so they mention you at every opportunity.</aside>
      <p>Last night saw Kate take on the terrifying challenge of walking across a 300ft high plank.</p>
      <p>As she stepped onto the plank and the winds picked up, Kate said: "I don’t know if I can do it."</p>
      <p>However, she did manage to walk across the plank and complete the challenge alongside her team partner Andrew Maxwell.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite her efforts, unfortunately, Kate didn't win the challenge and joined Andrew, Caitlyn Jenner, James Haskell, Jacqueline Jossa and Ian Wright in the less-than-luxury camp.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Adele Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Myles Stephenson and Roman Kemp were treated to Croc Creek.</p>
      <p>Kate will also face tonight's Bushtucker Trial, Bugged Off!, with American TV star Caitlyn.</p>
