      <h1>Google Maps’ upcoming Local Guides feature turns it into a social network</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:31:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>Following the recent update to <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/google-maps-profile-edit/">public profiles on Google Maps</a>, Google on Friday announced a new Local Guides feature that will help users follow people and discover new locations on the platform.</p>
      <p>“People in Bangkok, Delhi, London, Mexico City, New York, Osaka, San Francisco, São Paulo and Tokyo will soon see top Local Guides featured in the For You tab of the Google Maps app,” the company explained on its <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/maps/discover-new-places-with-help-from-local-guides/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>With the new feature, users will be able to follow Google’s Local Guides to receive the latest updates about activities available around them.</p>
      <p>“When you follow one of these Local Guides, their recommendations will be surfaced to you in Google Maps, so you can get inspired with ideas of things to do and places to go,” Google explained.</p>
      <p>Together with public profile management, the new feature suggests that Google Maps will soon become more of a social platform than a simple navigation tool.</p>
