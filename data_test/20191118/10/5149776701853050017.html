      <p>A bar has launched an advent calendar where revellers don't have to wait to find out what's behind each door.</p>
      <p>The Botanist in West Bridgford has created a wooden calendar for party-goers this Christmas filled with tipples for groups to share.</p>
      <p>The 24 mini cocktails come in 50mil silver bottles and the calendar is served at the table. The mix includes the New World Pornstar Martini, Bay Leaf and Apricot Mai Tai and Apricot and Peach Smash.</p>
      <p>It's available for group bookings from November 28 to December 24 making it ideal for work parties and friends and family celebrations.</p>

      <p>Jack Jolly, at The Botanist, said: "Advent calendars are massively popular and a real treat for adults who start celebrating Christmas right from the moment they open the first calendar door.</p>
      <p>"We wanted all of our guests to be able to enjoy this magic of Christmas when they're having their <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/best-christmas-party-venues-nottingham-3327861">Christmas meals</a> and celebrations at The Botanist."</p>
      <p>The limited-edition<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/first-look-inside-thors-tipi-3542109"> cocktail</a> calendar costs Â£75 and should be pre-ordered by parties when booking or ahead of arriving for their reservation.</p>
