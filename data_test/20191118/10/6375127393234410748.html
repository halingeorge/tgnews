      <h3>WITH or without emergency powers, President Duterte is still committed to pursue with vigor and determination the national government’s highly-ambitious “Build, Build, Build” program. </h3>
      <p>In fact, President Duterte is seen to maximize the use of his “available powers” to ensure the full implementation of the government’s flagship projects before he leaves Malacanang in 2022.</p>
      <p>The Chief Executive’s priorities, aside from his infrastructure program, are the reduction, if not total eradication of official corruption, ending the “drug menace” and addressing criminality.</p>
      <p>Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo said he considered as “good idea” the proposal to grant emergency powers to Duterte to speed up the implementation of the infrastructure program.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday, Albay 2nd District Rep. Joey Salceda filed House Bill No. 5456, which seeks to grant special powers to President Duterte to fast-track the BBB program’s implementation.</p>
      <p>But Panelo, also the chief presidential counsel, was quick to explain that the proposal is “no longer a priority legislative agenda” of the Duterte administration considering the time constraint.  </p>
      <p>Under the 1987 Constitution, the six-year presidency of tough-talking Duterte, the first Mindanaoan to occupy the top political post of the land, is set to end at 12 noon on June 30, 2022.</p>
      <p>Panelo described the proposed measure as “belated” considering the fact that “we only have less than three years left in office.”</p>
      <p>In the view of his still growing army of supporters and admirers, Duterte is in a position to realize his dream of transforming sleepy barangays in the countryside into flourishing communities.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, the Duterte administration, with the support of the Filipino people, should hasten the implementation and completion of projects under the “Build, Build, Build” program.</p>
