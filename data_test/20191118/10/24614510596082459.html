      <h1>In Walmart-Amazon War, Investors are Buying Potential Ahead of Reality</h1>
      <h2>WMT is a hotter stock than AMZN, even though the 'everything store' is growing much faster</h2>

      <p><b>Walmart</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/wmt-stock-quote/"><b><u>WMT</u></b></a>) should not be a momentum stock. Right now, it is. After reporting earnings $3.29 billion, or $1.16 per share, on revenue of $129 billion, for the quarter ending in October, WMT stock is due to open this morning at just shy of $119 per share.</p>

      <p>That’s a market cap of $338.1 billion, and a price to earnings ratio of 23.8. The yield on the 53 cents per share dividend is down to 1.76%.</p>
      <p>Rather than arguing with the market, or saying again that Walmart is overvalued, it might be better to ask why investors love it so in 2019. And they <i>do</i> love it. Even with its latest <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Earnings-Release-Q3-FY20.pdf">post-earnings</a> pullback, WMT stock is up nearly 28% on the year. That’s twice the gain of <b>Amazon</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amzn-stock-quote/"><b><u>AMZN</u></b></a>), which is up 13%.</p>
      <h3>Why We Love Walmart</h3>
      <p>In its third fiscal quarter Walmart sales rose 3.2%, year over year, and e-commerce sales surged. Profits rose, and <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/14/ways-walmart-crushed-its-quarterly-earnings-report.aspx">the company raised guidance</a>.</p>
      <p>The reason for this, in two words, is fresh food. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/walmart-is-a-grocery-powerhouse-and-it-still-has-room-to-run.html">Groceries represent 56% of Walmart’s sales.</a> Shoppers prefer Walmart’s curbside pickup to even shopping in the store. The company is trying to take advantage by offering to <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/walmart-will-deliver-groceries-to-your-refrigerator-by-entering-your-home">put groceries right into customers’ refrigerators</a> . (Like that doesn’t sound creepy?)</p>
      <p>The biggest loser here isn’t Amazon, but <b>Kroger</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/kr-stock-quote/"><b><u>KR</u></b></a>), which committed to doing grocery delivery through <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/05/17/ocado-kroger-warehouse-automation-amazon-walmart/">automated warehouses licensed from Ocado.</a> Analysts now consider that move <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/krogers-ocado-strategy-is-misguided-firm-says/564805/">misguided,</a> even as it breaks ground on <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/kroger-names-location-sixth-ocado-warehouse">the sixth</a> of what are supposed to be 20 regional centers.</p>
      <p>Walmart’s success is said to be part of a mega-trend. Online sales represent 3% of the grocery category right now but are expected to hit 20% of it in five years, following patterns set in South Korea and Japan.</p>
      <h3>Why Walmart is Worried</h3>
      <p>The problem, as Walmart management admitted <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q3-FY20-Combined-Scripts-final.pdf,">in its conference call</a>. is that grocery is a very low-margin business. People are just picking up groceries, not higher-margin merchandise.</p>
      <p>While Walmart’s pick-up success has the potential for spectacular growth, investors are buying potential ahead of reality. Walmart’s revenues for its first three quarters are up just 1.8% from a year ago. Walmart’s margins in the U.S. are down on the year and it’s projecting earnings growth of under 10%.</p>
      <p>That’s not going to be enough to justify the current valuation, a P/E within touching distance of <b>Microsoft</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/"><b><u>MSFT</u></b></a>), which is at 27.9x, and with only a slightly higher yield.</p>
      <p>The competition is not standing still. Amazon is launching a second grocery chain, and Kroger is launching in-store pick-up. The real winner in the retail space this year has been <b>Costco Wholesale</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cost-stock-quote/"><b><u>COST</u></b></a>). Its stock is up by one-third this year, with sales up nearly 8%, net income up 11%, and strength in all merchandise categories, not just grocery.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line on WMT Stock</h3>
      <p>Walmart has grown by changing in some ways but remaining true to itself in others. It still sells guns, and it still puts merchandise <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2019/11/15/walmart-beats-3q-expectations--continues-to-sell-guns-and-still-uses-plastic-bags/#67a8302e5caf">in plastic bags</a>. WMT stock’s success may be due, in part, to its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-14/walmart-wmt-earnings-show-it-is-competing-strong-against-amazon">perceived advantage against Amazon</a>, and the growing backlash against its Seattle-based rival.</p>
      <p>But Amazon is still catching up. If it hits its expected fourth quarter sales of <a href="https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/amzn">$86 billion</a>, Amazon will have 2019 sales of almost $280 billion, with growth of 20%. Walmart is still bigger, but only by 87%. Last year it was over twice as large by sales. Amazon is also drawing more of its revenue to the net income line than Walmart, over $10 billion last quarter against Walmart’s $6.7 billion.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned. In this drama, <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/03/chasing-amazon-is-nothing-but-bad-news-for-walmart-stock/">Ahab has yet to slay the white whale</a>.</p>
