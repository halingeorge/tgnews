      <p>The much-anticipated third season of The Crown has dropped on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> and we are all kinds of excited.</p>
      <p>Olivia Colman and Helen Bonham Carter take over the reins from award-wining <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/claire-foy/">Claire Foy</a> and Matt Smith.</p>
      <p>It’s safe to say it is an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/crown-season-3-review-olivia-colman-reigns-supreme-queen-elizabeth-steps-back-major-plot-roles-11039940/">action-packed season</a>, covering the turbulent years of the 1970s, which saw the miners’ strikes and the breakdown of Princess Margaret’s marriage as well as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/19/crown-season-3-prince-philip-star-tobias-menzies-relationship-prince-charles-10595474/">Prince Charles and Camilla’s infamous love affair</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s not to mention the Aberfan disaster and the assassination of Lord Mountbatten.</p>
      <p>But before we get started on all that, let’s take a look at the cast, and why Claire Foy won’t be returning.</p>
      <h3>What happened to Claire Foy in The Crown?</h3>
      <p>Claire Foy won countless awards – including multiple BAFTAs – for her portrayal of the young Queen Elizabeth II in the first two seasons of the royal drama.</p>

      <p>So while she clearly aced the role, at 35, she’s simply too young to play the Queen, who will pass through her forties over the newest season.</p>

      <h3>Who is in the season 3 cast of The Crown?</h3>
      <p>The show feels pretty different from the first two installments, as the cast has been completely overhauled.</p>
      <p>Our new favourite red carpet duo, Olivia Colman and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/the-crown-series-3-premiere-olivia-colman-and-helena-bonham-carter-are-positively-regal-11122047/">Helena Bonham Carter, </a>will play royal sisters <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/the-crown-series-3-premiere-olivia-colman-and-helena-bonham-carter-are-positively-regal-11122047/">Queen Elizabeth II and Princes Margaret </a>and will be accompanied by Tobias Menzies (Outlander) as Prince Philip.</p>
