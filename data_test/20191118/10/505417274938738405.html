        <b>The Republic of Ireland have confirmed their matchday squad for tonight’s crucial Euro 2020 qualifier with Denmark.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Boys In Green know that if they secure a win tonight they will secure a spot in next summer’s European Championships while a loss will see Mick McCarthy’s side go through to the Nations League playoffs as the final opportunity to clinch a berth.</p>
      <p>The matchday squad has been confirmed for tonight’s match which includes Troy Parrott and Jack Byrne although whether McCarthy opts to include the duo who performed very well against New Zealand is another question.</p>
