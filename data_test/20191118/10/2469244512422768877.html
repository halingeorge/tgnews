      <h2>The show follows on from the Autumn programme</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:45:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Clarke</a></address>
      <p>An award-winning Lebanese movie is the next to feature at the Tiverton Film Club.</p>
      <p>The show follows on from the Autumn programme’s Danish thriller, The Guilty in September and French drama The House by the Sea in October.</p>
      <p>The next meeting is on Wednesday, November 20, where they will be showing Capernaum. The film won the Cannes Grand Jury Prize in 2018.</p>
      <p>It is the story of a clever and gutsy 12-year-old boy surviving on his wits in the slums of Beirut.</p>
      <p>Ian Harkness from the club said: “The passion and compassion of the story illustrate what poverty and deprivation - and love - means in this troubled part of the world.</p>
      <p>“In summary, it is a tough and funny tale of a little boy lost in an unjust world. It is a very relevant film about a very crowded part of the Middle East, and the young star gives a wonderful performance.</p>
      <p> “As ever, the film starts at 7:00 pm in the Petroc Theatre. Doors open 6:30 pm and guests are welcome at £5 a head. Our next film will be ‘Faces Places’ a French road movie on December 11.” </p>
