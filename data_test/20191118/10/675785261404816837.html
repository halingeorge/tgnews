      <h2>WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Lucy Rose Jaine, from Wanaka, New Zealand, still hunts to provide food for her family as she is against using intensive factory-farmed products</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:55:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A mum received <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/death-threats">death threats</a> after sharing these risqué photos <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hunting">hunting</a> photos online.</p>
      <p>Lucy Rose Jaine, 29, says she provides food for her family by hunting wild pigs, deer, chamois, tahr, goats, rabbits and wallabies.</p>
      <p>She and her partner Sharn are against using intensive factory-farmed food and claim they save about £150 per month through hunting animals.</p>
      <p>But after posing with the bodies of some of these animals and sharing the pictures on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , Lucy has faced scrutiny for her decision and even death threats.</p>
      <p>But Lucy, who is heavily pregnant, defended herself today.</p>
      <p>She said: "I’ve had a few death threats from people who just don’t have any experience with hunting. Or maybe they are against animal cruelty. But I don’t take it to heart.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>We love hunting and the outdoors. Pig hunting mainly but we do it all and bring the kids along for the ride.</p>
      <p>"A day hunting is always different but usually starts with packing the truck and heading off into the mountains or the bush."</p>
      <p>The mum-of-three, from Wanaka, New Zealand <b>,</b> often takes her children and dogs on some hunts.</p>

      <p>"I like that we can teach our children how to hunt their own food. I hate factory farming so hunting wild meat is ideal, organic and sustainable," Lucy said.</p>
      <p>"When they find a pig, they let us know by barking and we follow our GPS to where they are.</p>
      <p>"We then stick the pig or shoot it, gut it then carry it out."</p>

      <p>The biggest animal the family have hunted was a 17-stone boar and they hunt between five to 10 animals each month.</p>
      <p>Lucy, who works as a painter, added: "The animals are living a good life. I don’t support factory farming and we prefer organic. It’s free, it’s fun and it helps the farmers.</p>

      <p>"We gut, skin and clean the animals. Then we cut it up and pop it in the freezer to eat.</p>
      <p>"The kids love the adventure. We don’t do screens in our family. Being in the wilderness so much really sparks their imaginations."</p>
      <p>However people online have blasted Lucy.</p>

      <p>One <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> user branded her pictures "evil" while others suggested her behaviour posing with the animals was "abhorrent".</p>
      <p>"It’s the posing with the kill that I find abhorrent. Yes kill to feed your family ( not to trophy hunt ) but don’t pose proudly with the dead animals," wrote one person.</p>
      <p>"Hunting for food I have no problem with, posting it over social media is glorifying it too much for my liking," said another.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Others praised Lucy for going to efforts to provide for her kids.</p>
      <p>One woman posted: "She's killing for food that they will eat! So there really isn't a problem."</p>
      <p>Another said: "At least she's making use of the meat and not just killing it and leaving it."</p>
