      <p>Not for the first time <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/brendon-urie-recorded-a-metal-song-while-he-was-drunk-and-stoned-in-his-room/">this year</a>, Brendon Urie has been dabbling in music away from <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/panic-at-the-disco/">Panic! At The Disco</a>’s usual theatrical pop-rock – and he’s just dropped a brand-new metal track. (And spoiler alert: it rules.)</p>
      <p>The frontman has seemingly been working on all sorts of stuff in his home studio, and he unveiled this recent effort as part of a Twitch live stream on November 15 for his Highest Hopes Foundation charity.</p>

      <p>While Brendon had offered up a whole bunch of cool incentives for fans to donate on the stream, once the total hit $75,000 he played a new metal song (twice, actually) for those watching to enjoy. And luckily, people were on hand to record it for your listening pleasure, too.</p>
      <p>Check it out at 5:59 and again at 8:55, and enjoy Brendon’s infectious enthusiasm…</p>

      <p>Hell yeah. And big up Brendon for raising a massive $134,600.69 for charity – see more on his Highest Hopes Foundation <a href="https://panicatthedisco.com/highesthopesfoundation/">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Brendon revealed back in May this year that a follow-up to last year’s Pray For The Wicked album “won’t be too long”.</p>
      <p>“I thought I would take a little more time off and I’m already starting music,” he told <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8509778/brendon-urie-talks-taylor-swift-new-panic-at-the-disco">Billboard</a>. “Not with anything planned in mind, but just working on some ideas. I can’t help myself, so I don’t think it’ll be too long before another Panic! record.”</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Pray For The Wicked was also created under similar circumstances, with Brendon expecting to take a break after touring and performing in Broadway play Kinky Boots – and instead being drawn into his home studio to work.</p>
      <p>“I thought I was going to take a break, and I told myself and my management, I said: ‘The day that I get home, from that day, I want two weeks. I’m not going to pick up my phone, I’m not going to check my email… you guys can’t contact me, I am off the grid! And if I end up alive after that two weeks we can get back to work, but I’m <i>gone</i>!’” he told Kerrang!. “So two days went by where I literally was just getting high and playing video games, for two days straight, and it was the <i>best</i> – just laying there so casually, just chilling. And then… ugh… I couldn’t stay away from the studio. So I would just jump to the back yard and just go and do whatever was inspiring to me.”</p>
