      <h3>COMMUNICATIONS Secretary Martin Andanar has hit US Senator Bernie Sanders for saying there are “abhorrent human rights abuses” in the Philippines, following the simultaneous arrest of members of progressive groups.</h3>
      <p>“Senator Sanders is grandstanding on an issue he obviously does not know the details of, not to mention meddling in our national affairs, which he has no business over,” Andanar said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Sanders reacted to an article by the International Trade Union Confederation, which highlighted the alleged police repression of Filipino trade unionists. It noted the arrest of 57 people, including 13 minors, who were nabbed in the regional offices of progressive group Bayan Muna and other militant groups in cities of Bacolod and Escalante. Thirty- one activists were eventually released from prison “for lack of probable cause.”</p>
      <p>Sanders, who is a 2020 US presidential candidate, tweeted on November 15, “In recent years, we have seen abhorrent human rights abuses by the Philippine government. This repression of trade unionists is a shameful attempt to silence people’s rights and freedoms. More than ever, we must stand on the side of global human rights.”</p>
      <p>The article also mentioned the “broader climate of government repression in the Philippines,” citing the bloody war on drugs launched by President Rodrigo Duterte.</p>
