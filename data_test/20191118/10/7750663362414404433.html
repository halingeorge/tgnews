      <p>Palmer made his international debut in the 3-0 defeat in Nur-Sultan which opened Scotland's European Championship qualification group.</p>
      <p>They close their Group I campaign against Kazakhstan on Tuesday night at Hampden with a different manager in place after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-clarke/"><b>Steve Clarke</b></a> replaced <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-mcleish/"><b>Alex McLeish</b></a> two games in.</p>
      <p>Palmer agrees with Clarke that Scotland need to look forward to March's play-off campaign and beating Kazakhstan to seal third place and a hat-trick of wins would help with confidence and momentum.</p>

      <p>But after waiting seven months for his second cap, Palmer is also looking to exorcise some demons from his debut.</p>
      <p>Palmer, who made his fourth Scotland appearance in Saturday's win over Cyprus, told the PA news agency: "The boys who didn't play on Saturday, if they get a chance to play on Tuesday they will be keen to show what they can do and everyone is trying to stake a claim for, hopefully, two big games in March.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is pushing towards that. It would be massive, not just for me obviously, but for everyone in the country, fans, if we can get there.</p>
      <p>"But it's an old cliche, one game at a time, and just build from what is a winnable game and a bit of revenge for some of us who were out there at the start of the campaign.</p>
      <p>"It's another element we will be looking to address."</p>
