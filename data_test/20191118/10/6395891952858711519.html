      <p><b>PHILADELPHIA, P.a.</b> - Two weeks removed from a 37-20 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, the New England Patriots returned to winner's circle with a 17-10 victory over the Eagles at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field. </p>

      <p>Trailing at the beginning of the second half, the Patriots (9-1) opened the third quarter with authority and a bit of trickery. Marching 84 yards on 10 plays in just over four minutes, New England capped off their first – and only – touchdown drive of the day with a 15-yard touchdown pass – from Julian Edelman. </p>
      <p>The former college quarterback dusted off his throwing arm and hit Phillip Dorsett in the end zone to give the Patriots the lead. The play began with Brady quickly throwing a backwards pass to Edelman, who then found a wide-open Dorsett running across the end zone for the score.  </p>
      <p>A James White two-yard plunge pushed the lead to seven on a successful two-point conversion. </p>

      <p>New England's defense was able to blank the Eagles (5-5) in the second half after allowing 10 points on Philadelphia's first three drives of the game. And while the Eagles marched down the field with under five minutes remaining in the contest, the Patriots' defense was able to force a turnover on downs with just under a minute to go to seal the win.</p>
      <p>In the first half, the Eagles jumped out to an early lead, but New England kept was able to keep pace, converting three field goal opportunities to keep them within a point at halftime.</p>
      <p>And while the Patriots' offense missed chances to score touchdowns in the opening half, their ability to move the ball into the red zone made the score 10-9 in favor of the Eagles at halftime. </p>
      <p>The Eagles, who received the opening kickoff, got out to an early lead thanks to points on two of their first three drives. </p>
      <p>A Jason McCourty pass interference penalty on the first play from scrimmage set Philadelphia up at the Patriots' 26-yard-line. And while New England's defense was able to keep the Eagles out of the end zone, Jake Elliot's field goal from 42 yards made it 3-0 in favor of the home team. </p>
      <p>Two drives later, the Eagles began on their own 5-yard-line after a Jake Bailey punt. The Philadelphia drive would end 16 plays later with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Carson Wentz to Dallas Goedert to push the Eagles’ lead to 10-0.</p>
