      <p>Julian Assange is unable to work on his extradition case because he has been given an unsuitable computer in prison, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old WikiLeaks founder is accused of leaking US government secrets in one of the largest breaches of confidential information.</p>
      <p>Appearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court via video-link on Monday, Assange wore a grey prison-issue jumper and spoke only to confirm his identity.</p>
      <p>Assange had his white hair slicked back and appeared to have stubble. He wore thin-rimmed glasses which he cleaned on his top before the judge entered.</p>
      <p>During Monday’s five-minute hearing, attended by supporters including his father, John Shipton, Assange’s remand in HMP Belmarsh was extended.</p>

      <p>He was set to be released from the high-security prison in September but was remanded in custody due to fears that he would abscond after he spent nearly seven years in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.</p>
      <p>Gareth Peirce, representing Assange, told the court that her client was unable to adequately prepare for his “very challenging case” as the computer he had been given was not suitable.</p>
      <p>Ms Peirce said: “I will put it on the record, you will understand that we are working extremely hard on this very challenging case; however, the most important of the impediments that we are facing is Mr Assange’s ability to access what he needs to work on his own case.</p>
      <p>“After months of battle he was provided with a computer but it is not the sort of computer needed to work on the case.”</p>
      <p>District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said she had no jurisdiction over the prison conditions.</p>
      <p>Ms Peirce replied that she wanted to “exert pressure as best we can” on Belmarsh to improve the computer facilities.</p>
      <p>Speaking outside court, a member of Assange’s team told the PA news agency that the computer was unlikely to have internet access needed for research.</p>
      <p>District Judge Baraitser remanded Assange in custody ahead of a substantive case management hearing on December 19.</p>
      <p>He will appear again at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on December 13 to confirm his remand in prison again before he ultimately appears for full extradition proceedings in February.</p>
