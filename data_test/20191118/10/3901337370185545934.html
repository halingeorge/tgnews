      <p>The 25-year-old EA Guingamp midfielder has been on the fringes of the South African senior national team for some time now, but has only been given cameo roles for the most part over the last few years.</p>
      <p>New head coach, Molefi Ntseki, decided to hand him a starting berth against Sudan as they chased three points in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on the back of defeat against Ghana in Cape Coast, and he grasped his opportunity with both hands as he put in a game-winning Man of the Match performance. </p>

      <p>Phiri, who has been a key player for Guingamp in French Ligue 2 this season, rifled home a fine finish towards the end of the first half after he’d already created numerous chances for his teammates, a goal that ended up being the winner for Ntseki’s side at Orlando Stadium.</p>
