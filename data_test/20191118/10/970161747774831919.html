      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a>’s cultural appropriation scandal played out on Sunday’s episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians – where the stay is seen panicking over the offensive name of her shapewear line.</p>
      <p>The reality star came under fire after announcing her new line of underwear would be called Kimono – a traditional Japanese dress with symbolic meaning to the country.</p>
      <p>As a result<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/26/kim-kardashian-accused-cultural-appropriation-trademarks-kimono-shapewear-range-10074957/">, she was called out for appropriating the name</a> and was begged to consider a rethink of the brand that would disrespect the Japanese culture.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Even the Mayor of Kyoto, Japan, penned an open letter to the star asking her to come up with another name.</p>
      <p>A panicked Kim shared her business worries with Scott Disick, claiming the change could cost $10million (£7.71million)</p>
      <p>‘Who would ever think that hey, I would want to do something that would be disrespectful?’ she told him.</p>
      <p>‘They’re saying that I’m cultural appropriating.’</p>

      <p>She added that until the official announcement, no one – including the retailers buying the garments – had thought that it was an issue.</p>
      <p>Kim admitted later on that it was ‘foolish and ignorant’ of her to think that.</p>
      <p>Reading the letter in the confessionals, Kim said: ‘”Kimono is a traditional ethnic dress, and truly symbolizes sense of beauty, spirits and value of Japanese.”’</p>
      <p>‘Reading that letter I felt an understanding. I definitely did not want to disrespect a culture,’ she added.</p>

        <figcaption>Kim decided to listen to her fans and rebrand (Picture: E!)</figcaption>

      <p>‘That’s not what the brand is even about. It’s about inclusivity, it’s about comfort. It’s not about making people feel uncomfortable.’</p>
      <p>Thankfully, after quick thinking from her team, they were able to rebrand without the $10million price tag – and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/01/kim-kardashian-apologises-vows-rename-kimono-range-cultural-appropriation-backlash-10097640/">Kim apologised publicly</a> and vowed to change it up, thanking people for making her aware of the issue.</p>
      <p>After looking through names including Kim Barely and KKW (Kim Kardashian Wear), she eventually settled on the (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/26/kim-kardashian-renames-controversial-shapewear-line-skims-genius-name-10634701/">seriously much better) name of SKIMS.</a></p>

      <p>In a photo, she declared: ‘My fans and followers are a huge inspiration to me – I’m always listening to their feedback and opinions, and am so grateful they shared their ideas for a new brand name.</p>
      <p>After much thought and consideration, I’m excited to announce the launch of SKIMS Solutionwear.’</p>
