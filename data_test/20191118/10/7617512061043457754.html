      <p>The search for a missing man at Lake Cowichan has been suspended until further notice, according to Cowichan Search and Rescue.</p>
      <p>Lake Cowichan RCMP were at the scene this morning where a missing man’s fishing kayak washed ashore near Little Shaw Creek. Seventy-year-old Colin Court has been missing since at least Friday.</p>
      <p>At 10 a.m. Monday, all of the detachment’s officers were at the scene.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Cowichan Search and Rescue was scouring the shores and surface waters of Lake Cowichan after the kayak washed ashore.</p>
      <p>Court, who celebrated his birthday on Thursday, told his family he was going flyfishing on Friday and that’s the last they heard from him, according to searchers.</p>
      <p>RCMP have reported a motorist found a truck belonging to Court parked at the Little Shaw campground on Cowichan Lake, west of Youbou, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Rain plagued Saturday’s search, but crews returned to the search at daybreak on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Lake Cowichan RCMP could not be reached for comment.</p>
