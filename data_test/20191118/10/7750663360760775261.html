      <h1>Chelsea join Liverpool, Manchester United in Joe Gelhardt race?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> have reportedly identified <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/wigan-athletic/"><b>Wigan Athletic</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-gelhardt/"><b>Joe Gelhardt</b></a> as a potential future signing.</h2>

      <p>The 17-year-old has featured regularly in the first-team squad at the DW Stadium this season, making a total of seven substitute outings in the Championship.</p>
      <p>The England Under-18 international has been linked with the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a>, who may be ready to move for the teenager in January or at the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>However, according to the <i>Daily Star</i>, Chelsea also see Gelhardt as a possible addition as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a> monitors the progression of English football's top prospects.</p>
      <p>While the Blues are currently serving a two-window transfer ban, the west Londoners will look to halve their punishment before the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>Gelhardt penned a contract as recently as last week, although is unlikely to prevent teams from making bids for his signature.</p>
