      <h1>Lorraine savages Boris Johnson's 'friend' Jennifer Arcuri on Good Morning Britain</h1>
      <h2>Viewers were astounded by her obvious anger</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:57:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>An exasperated <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/lorraine/">Lorraine Kelly</a> left Jennifer Arcuri reeling earlier today as she ripped into the American businesswoman on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a>.</p>
      <p>Both her and Arcuri's names trended heavily on social media following the clash which played out across a split TV screen after hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> and Susanna Reid introduced Lorraine to speak about what was coming up on her own ITV show.</p>
      <p>But coming just moments after the ex-model’s unenlightening chat, Lorraine switched focus back to the show guest and ripped into her live on air.</p>
      <p>"That was crazy, wasn't it?" Lorraine sighed to the GMB presenters from her studio.</p>

      </p>
      <p>She continued: "What was the point? Coming down and not answering any questions. What's the point in that?"</p>
      <p>Piers then invited Arcuri - who was still sitting with him and Susanna on GMB - to respond to Lorraine, who then addressed her words directly to Boris Johnson’s ex tech tutor.</p>

      <p>Lorraine scoffed: "It just doesn't make any sense. What's the point in you coming down and not saying anything?"</p>
      <p>A stunned Arcuri was then asked the same question again after she indicated she hadn’t heard Lorraine before responding: "I believe I said a few things. What was it that you were looking for that I didn’t say?"</p>

      </p>
      <p>But that answer still held no sway with Lorraine, who brutally dismissed Arcuri: "You didn't answer any of the questions put to you.</p>
      <p>"I don’t see the point of you being on... anyway."</p>
      <p>Viewers praised the TV presenter as a 'hero' for her uncompromising approach during the hostile encounter, with some suggesting the Scottish star may have been a better choice to conduct the interview with the guest who swerved answering questions put to her.</p>
      <p>"You go girl! You had the guts to say what many were shouting at the TV! Can't beat live TV! #lorraineforPM," wrote on Twitter user.</p>

      <p>"Well said Lorraine. The only point was to get her face back on the screen again," tweeted another.</p>
      <p>Another viewer added: "You spoke for all of us Lorraine, good on you!!"</p>
      <p>Asked directly during the GMB appearance whether her association with Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London was 'an affair', Arcuri replied: "I'm not going to answer that question.</p>
      <p>"But as you can tell there was a very special relationship there and when it did come out, half the people already assumed the affair and told me to admit.</p>

      <p>"The other half just wanted me to deny, deny, deny."</p>
      <p>She also claimed the Prime Minister hung up on her last weekend when she called him.</p>
      <p>In her previous appearance on the ITV daytime show, Arcuri bizarrely asked Piers Morgan whether he was 'falling in love with her' <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/piers-morgan-hits-back-as-gmb-guest-grills-him-on-his-sex-life-on-air/">as she faced questions about her alleged affair with Johnson</a>.</p>
