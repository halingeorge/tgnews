      <h2>More than half of this came from Forge of Empires, company has grown revenues every year since 2007</h2>

      <p>German developer and publisher InnoGames is celebrating a key milestone as its lifetime revenues have passed €1 billion.</p>
      <p>The studio was first founded in 2007 and is best known for strategy games such as Grepolis, Tribal Wars and Forge of Empires.</p>
      <p>The latter has contributed significantly to the company's achievement, with InnoGames announcing earlier this year that it has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-06-25-forge-of-empires-reaches-500m-in-lifetime-revenue">generated more than €500 million on its own</a> -- over half InnoGames' lifetime takings.</p>
      <p>Grepolis and Tribal Wars, meanwhile, have each made more than €100 million, with 2015 launch Elvenar "[continuing] to catch up fast." The company has seen double-digit percentage growth in revenue ever year since the company was founded.</p>
      <p>Initially focused on PC browser titles, InnoGames now reports more than half of its revenues come from mobile, a segment that has grown by an average of 56% year-on-year since 2015 for the company.</p>
      <p>Located in Hamburg, InnoGames is home to more than 400 employees, who run seven live games. Playtime for the developer's combined portfolio was reported at 337,723 years.</p>
