      <p>India's tablet PC market witnessed 7.8 per cent growth in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same year-ago period -- with Lenovo, Samsung and Apple rounding off the top three spots, market research firm CyberMedia Research (CMR) said on Monday.</p>
      <p>"During 3Q 2019, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tablet-market">tablet market </a>in India showed some tepid signs of growth, primarily on the back of new launches by the top players. Lenovo's leadership in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tablet-market">tablet market </a>was primarily on the back of its consumer tablets," Kanika Jain, Analyst-Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR said in a statement.</p>
      <p>At 37.7 per cent market share, Lenovo extended its lead in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tablet-market">tablet market </a>share, compared with 29 per cent growth in the second quarter this year.</p>
      <p>The introduction of a new Tab V7, P10 and E series contributed to strong figures for the Lenovo. Its M10 series launched earlier this year had a good share of 22 per cent.</p>
      <p>Samsung settled in its usual second place in the market. The introduction of the new Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2019) and the premium Tab S series helped the company's tablet shipment to grow by 22 per cent quarter on quarter.</p>
      <p>Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019) series launched in last quarter is its best performing series with 45 per cent share as it also helped Samsung to slowly encroach on the tablet market space by 3 per cent.</p>
      <p>The newly launched base level iPad 7 series helped Apple improve on its market share with a 7 per cent QoQ growth.</p>
      <p>"The industry will keep on moving towards providing smarter technology with a focus on innovation and customer centricity. Supporting the government's 'Digital India' campaign, transformation of education space, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) delivery network, hospitality, travel and tourism is a big focus area for tablet category", Kanika added.</p>
