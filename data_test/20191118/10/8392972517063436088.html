      <p>ITV2 viewers have called for presenter Emily Atack to go back to her old hairstyle after she showed off her new 'do on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!.</a></p>
      <p>The former campmate, 29, looked dramatically different last night (17.11.19) on the first episode of companion show Extra Camp, which she hosts alongside comedian Joel Dommett, 33, and former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> actor Adam Thomas, 31.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But fans of the show didn't appear to be into the new brunette look, which she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/im-a-celebritys-emily-atack-debuts-stunning-hair-transformation-at-pride-of-britain-awards/">recently debuted at the Pride of Britain Awards</a>.</p>
      <p>One said on Twitter: "What has Emily done to her hair, it's a no from me #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Emily Atack dyed her hair?! #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>A third, who seemed to prefer Emily's blonde look, tweeted: "That is not the hair color or style for Emily Atack."</p>
      <p>One added: "Don’t like Emily’s hair colour, back to blonde please."</p>
