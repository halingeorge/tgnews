      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:21:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>A thief who robbed a convenience store clerk by knifepoint in the Thai northeast over the weekend has been taken into custody, police said.</p>
      <p>Oomsin Noinarong, 18, has reportedly confessed to robbing a 7-Eleven store in Udon Thani city around 1pm on Saturday, and police said they arrested him later that night for a crime that netted THB4,200 (US$140.)</p>
      <p>Footage of the robbery circulating online shows a thief dressed in dark clothing with a tinted motorbike helmet during the robbery.</p>

      <p>He entered the store and asked a female clerk for help locating an item, according to <a href="https://morning-news.bectero.com/m/main.php?m=newsdetail&amp;cname=63&amp;nid=157074"><i>Morning News</i></a>. When the clerk turns around, according to security footage, he puts a knife to her back and leads her to enter her employee info into the cash register to access the store safe.</p>
      <p>When other employees come across the robbery, they appear panicked and look around but ultimately don’t intervene. The short clip ends with the thief pushing the store clerk to the ground and sitting on her before quickly sprinting out the door. </p>
      <p>Upon his arrest, Oomsin reportedly confessed to his crimes, telling police that he had briefly been a trainee at the convenience store but was now unemployed. He said robbing the store was a difficult decision but he really needed the money to get by. He told police that he borrowed a friend’s motorbike to commit the crime.</p>
      <p>Police said he will be prosecuted under the law.</p>
