      <p>NYC’s <b>ARChive of Contemporary Music</b>‘s annual Holiday Record + CD Sale runs from <b>December 7 – 22 at ARC HQ</b> (54 White St.) from 11 AM – 6 PM daily. Each year the sale gets bigger and the 2019 edition promises tens of thousands of duplicate records of LPs, CDs, 78s, books, posters, videos, DVDs and memorabilia donated every year in every genre imaginable. For these two weeks the ARC becomes the biggest record store in NYC and it’s the organization’s major fundraiser of the year — they’ve been <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/nycs-archive-of-contemporary-music-launches-gofundme-to-help-stay-afloat/">struggling to stay afloat</a> and say it may be the last sale at their Tribeca location. This year also will have rare CDs + LPs + promo items donated by Mute, Atlantic, and Beggars Arkive.</p>
      <p>As usual, the sale kicks off with a <b>Holiday Party on December 5</b> for ARC Members with complimentary food and drink, and a first crack at this year’s sale items. <a href="https://arcmusic.org/">Become a member</a> by donating the the ARC, and here’s a little more about what they do:</p>
      <blockquote>The ARChive of Contemporary Music (ARC) is a not-for-profit archive, music library and research center located in New York City since 1985.<br/><br/>ARC contains more than three million sound recordings. That’s 90 + million songs. We preserve copies of each version of every recording, in all known formats, and have electronically catalogued more than 400,000 sound recordings and digitized 200,000 without partners the Internet Archive – more than any other public, university or private library in America. ARC also houses more than three million pieces of attendant support material including photographs, videos, DVDs, books, magazines, press kits, sheet music, ephemera and memorabilia.<br/><br/>The value of ARC’s collection is not only in the rareness of many of our recordings, but in the breadth, size and organization of the collection. For every signed and unique copy of an early Rolling Stones LP, there are hundreds of relevant, formative, relatively unknown recordings that contributed to its creation, and thousands that benefit from its existence</blockquote>
      <p>You can donate your unwanted records, CDs, cassettes, 8-tracks, etc — they’ll come and pick it up if you live in NYC and its tax deductible. Learn more about donating and the ARC <a href="https://arcmusic.org/">here</a>.</p>
