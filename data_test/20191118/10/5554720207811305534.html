      <h1>Radhika Merchant emulates Nita Ambani’s daughter-in-law Shloka Mehta’s fashion statement as both flaunt ‘dressed to kill’ avatars</h1>

      <p>Nita Ambani’s daughter-in-law Shloka Mehta and future <i>bahu </i>Radhika Merchant sizzled in red last week when the Ambanis opened their doors to welcome some of the biggest names in Bollywood. The occasion was the pre-wedding function of Arjun Kothari, nephew of Mukesh and Nita Ambani. The general consensus was that both Shloka and Radhika had outshone even the likes of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Mira Rajput with their exquisite fashion statement. As it emerges, the two glamorous ladies associated with India’s richest family had more surprises in store as far as their outfits were concerned. Both looked even more glamorous in the ‘hot’ avatars when they attended the <i>sangeet </i>ceremony of their relative.</p>

      <p>Dressed in a baby pink embellished <i>lehenga choli </i>with hair pulled back and tied in a ponytail, Shloka looked dressed to kill. The jewellery is what took the cake as it was a full set of emerald and diamond choker, earrings, <i>maang</i> <i>tika</i>, finger ring and bangles on both hands. On the other hand, Radhika had opted for off-shoulder embellished off white <i>lehenga choli</i> with lace and feather effect. Like Shloka, Radhika’s hair too was pulled back into a ponytail, and her accessories included a diamond necklace, earrings, <i>maang tika</i> and bangles</p>
      <p>This was in sharp contrast to her ‘red hot’ look for another function last week. Shloka was spotted doing away with her no-makeup rule and looking stunningly glamorous in a single shoulder red lace mini dress with floral diamond danglers paired with white Greek-style slippers. While everyone’s focus was on Shloka and her sister-in-law Isha Ambani, who too was seen making a big fashion statement with a sleeveless <i>sharara</i>-saree designed by Anamika Khanna, not many had paid attention to Radhika Merchant, the future daughter-in-law of Mukesh and Nita Ambani.</p>
      <p>Radhika was seen slaying in her breathtakingly all-red ensemble. Her dress was the combination of Isha’s <i>sharara-saree </i>and the red colour <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/shloka-mehta-in-never-seen-before-red-hot-avatar-as-in-laws-mukesh-and-nita-ambani-welcome-aishwarya-rai-mira-rajput-at-home/272472/">chosen by Shloka.</a> What made her dress even more unique was the red cape. A fashion diva that she is, Radhika did not leave it here. She accessorised it with chandelier earrings and a layered neckpiece.</p>
      <p>Unlike Radhika, Shloka had also opted for a second outfit designed by Anamika Khanna. Her second dress comprised of lace lavender separates with a similar colour long-line lace jacket and an emerald and diamond choker.</p>
