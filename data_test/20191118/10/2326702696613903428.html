      <h1>Google Stadia (Finally) Getting More Launch Games</h1>

      <p>I really can’t help but feel Google is so far off the mark with their <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/stadia">Stadia</a> launch. I’m happy to be proven wrong though. For starters, they said it would only have 12 titles at launch, which is a bit drab in today’s market. Microsoft is plodding along with xCloud and a HUGE range of over 50 games for that. PlayStation Now has hundreds of games right now and it’s pretty cheap too. So Google really has to step up this time.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, they’ve revealed an additional ten games for the platform. That gives us a more modest 22 titles to pick from, including the recent Football Manager 2020, and NBA 2K2020 (albeit, that one sucks).</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia</h3>
      <p>Now, I really do want this thing to work out well, I really do. I reviewed the original <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/onlive-cloud-gaming-console-review/all/1/">OnLive</a> years back and have somewhat been a regular of game streaming ever since. Of course, OnLive is dead now, Sony snapped up that one for their own streaming service. It has come a long way, and I’m hoping to see some improvements from Google.</p>
      <p>4K, HDR, 60 FPS, surround sound and more will be available to gamers through a streaming service for gaming. No big console, no powerful and expensive computer to purchase. That means gamers could enjoy flagship gaming at bargain prices. So, let’s see what games we have!</p>
