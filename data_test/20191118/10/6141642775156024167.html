      <p>The JBBA Ladies League kicked off last week with the new format being the first competitive women’s basketball played in the Island in almost two decades.</p>
      <p>Women have been playing in the men’s system but now they have their own designated league, made up of four teams.</p>
      <p>Founder James Reed believes it will only improve women’s basketball and lead to an increase in people taking up the sport.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘It is the first time it has been run for 18 years, we believe, so it is great to get it up and running.</p>
      <p>‘Women have always played in basketball but up to now it has had to be in the men’s league.</p>
      <p>‘Having this league is great, we hope it will grow the number of people involved and improve women’s basketball for the Island.’</p>
