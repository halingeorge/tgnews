      <p>When it comes to could-have-been rikishi, the first name on most people’s lips is Futahaguro.</p>
      <p>His controversial expulsion from the sport in 1988 makes him the only yokozuna never to have won a championship.</p>
      <p>Futahaguro, however, at least made it to the rank of yokozuna.</p>
      <p>Another troubled young rikishi saw a promising career come to an end just as he was coming out of his teens.</p>
      <p>Soslan Gagloev’s arrest for marijuana possession led to his dismissal from sumo in 2008.</p>
      <p>Fighting under a ring name (Wakanoho) that combined characters from two yokozuna, the 19-year-old Gagloev earned four straight winning records from his top-division debut and had been promoted to the highest maegashira rank.</p>
      <p>A controversial figure among fans, Wakanoho combined a large powerful frame and excellent grappling skills with a tendency to try large leaping sidesteps at the faceoff.</p>
      <p>His potential was matched only by his immaturity and unfortunately the Russian never got the guidance he needed in a Magaki Beya that was in constant turmoil following the death of the stablemaster’s wife and Magaki himself suffering a stroke.</p>
      <p>Wakanoho’s age, combined with the results he was achieving both in training and tournaments against top rankers, strongly indicated that he could have been a multiple-title-winning ozeki or yokozuna had he remained in the sport.</p>
      <p>At the end of his short sumo life he owned winning records against Kakuryu, Harumafuji (then known as Ama), Kisenosato and Goeido, among others.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t to be, however, and after retirement Gagloev moved to the United States and started playing football in college.</p>
      <p>He made a few appearances in amateur sumo tournaments and exhibitions in later years, but the slimmed-down former Wakanoho was a clearly a shadow of the teen that showed such promise a decade earlier.</p>
