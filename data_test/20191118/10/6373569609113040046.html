      <h1>Why striker Billy Clarke missed Plymouth Argyle's away game against Forest Green Rovers</h1>
      <h2>Ryan Lowe has also talked about the absence of Will Aimson and Conor Grant from the squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:49:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Lowe does not believe the injury to Plymouth Argyle striker Billy Clarke which ruled him out of the 1-0 away League Two win against Forest Green Rovers is a serious one.</p>
      <p>Clarke did not travel to Gloucestershire with the rest of the Pilgrims’ squad for their clash against table-topping Forest Green.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old had tweaked his groin during training on Friday, Lowe revealed.</p>
      <p>Clarke has made one start and four substitute appearances <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">for the Pilgrims</a> since signing as a free agent last month.</p>
      <p>Defender Will Aimson and Conor Grant were also absent from the matchday squad of 18 against Forest Green, but that was purely due to selection.</p>
      <p>Even without Clarke, Lowe still had three strikers on the bench in Ryan Taylor, Dom Telford – who both played as second half substitutes – and Zak Rudden.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “Will Aimson and Conor Grant just missed out so they were the two spare men. We took 20 lads.</p>
      <p>“Billy Clarke, we left him at home because in shooting at training on Friday he just tweaked his groin.</p>
      <p>“He will be alright, he just feels it needs to settle down. Bill is a seasoned pro and wanted to make sure it was right.</p>
      <p>“So rather than me putting him on the bench, him sitting there cold and stiffening up, I have have got a squad and we had Zak and Tayls.”</p>
