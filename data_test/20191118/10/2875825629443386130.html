      <h1>Paddy Clancy: The stories I've never told from my long career in journalism</h1>
      <h2>A Lifetime Achievement award I received the other day reminded me of how times have changed in the business</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:34:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/paddy-clancy/" target="_blank">Paddy Clancy</a></address>
      <p>Forgive me for a bit of personal indulgence, but the other day I proudly received a Lifetime Achievement award for my contribution over many decades to journalism.</p>
      <p>The award reminded me of how times have changed in the business - and how in the old days there were matters you wouldn’t dream of revealing to readers.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, probably with the proliferation of social media, virtually anything goes.</p>
      <p>For example, I never told the story of what really happened to the guy who escorted Princess Anne to the cinema.</p>
      <p>Oh, we reported the lovely evening he had sitting beside the princess as she wandered out of her manor into London’s East End to be accompanied to the flicks by a local youth.</p>
      <p>It was way back in 1970, and a picture of the 20-year-old princess being accompanied into the local ABC by a young Del Boy, along with a few words of how delightful it was to have a royal among London’s eastenders, was all editors required at the time.</p>
      <p>I feel free now to reveal, 49 years later, what really happened when we approached the young lad after the event when he had accompanied the princess to her departing chauffeur-driven car.</p>
      <p>When I approached him for a few words about what he and the Princess talked about during the film he told me he had to attend to some immediate urgent business but he would be back for an interview in a few minutes.</p>
      <p>True to his word, he returned in about four minutes with an explanation that he had to dash to the loo because, you see, he had a couple of pints to pluck up courage before he met the princess and he had been advised not to leave her side while they watched the film.</p>
      <p>So, half-way through, he had a certain urge and he could do nothing about it except squeeze his knees tightly together, try to retain the flow, so to speak, and pray desperately for the film to end so he could get her back to her car and make a dash to ease his agony.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t the kind of story you told Daily Telegraph readers in those days, so I relayed accounts instead of the princess’s extraordinary happy date with a young man from the East End.</p>
      <p>Personally, I believe he merited a knighthood for his valiant behaviour, but I suspect he never got one.</p>

      <p>Then, there was the time a few years later, when I had switched to the Daily Express, that I was indirectly responsible for bringing the Balcombe Street siege in central London to an end.</p>
      <p>Four IRA gunmen, who had murdered and done extensive damage to London and adjoining areas in the previous 18 months, were chased by police through the streets and held a couple in their 50s hostage in a council apartment in December 1975.</p>
      <p>The siege lasted six days and ended without injury when the gunmen surrendered following a report that deadly SAS marksmen were quartered in a building across the street.</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Robert Mark and his senior officers knew there was a radio in the apartment and it was claimed they deliberately planted misleading information with the media to lure the gunmen to peacefully hand over the hostages and surrender.</p>
      <p>The true position is that the Express ran the story about the SAS presence which I had picked up from a private police contact during a break from my team at the siege. I had passed the information on to a senior crime reporter on my team and he confirmed it with his own sources. The gunmen picked it up when the BBC raised it a press conference after it was published.</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard got great publicity out of how they ended a confrontation with terrorists without loss of life or injury. My part in the process is made public for the first time here.</p>
      <p>Most memorable - and probably the saddest - encounter of my years in this business came when I accompanied President Mary Robinson to Somalia when it was stricken by war and terrible famine.</p>
      <p>After seeing dead bodies and watching a half-naked man who was too feeble to rise from the ground in Baidoa which was also known as the city of death, I reached a shed in which rows of quiet people sat on the floor, clearly recently washed by aid volunteers.</p>
      <p>They were mainly women and children, with some men, who had crossed the sizzling desert desperately searching for food.</p>
      <p>I detected a strange stench which I found difficult to place, considering the victims waiting to meet the President had somehow managed, extraordinarily, to make themselves presentable.</p>
      <p>A GOAL nurse from Longford explained the stench had its origin in the diarrhoea suffered by the starving victims. I was suddenly overwhelmed, and couldn’t stop the tears.</p>
      <p>I have seen death and destruction on a massive scale in this job, but that was the only time I cried publicly.</p>
      <p>Mary Robinson had a reputation of protecting her feelings. Even she couldn’t avoid shedding a few tears at a press conference in Nairobi a couple of days later when she attempted to describe her hurt at what so-called war-lords were doing to their own people in Somalia.</p>
      <p>Sad though the occasion, it was also the moment I felt proudest in my entire career when the President of Ireland brought so much hope to a stricken people.</p>
