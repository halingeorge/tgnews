      <p>The 38-year-old entered parliament in 2010 and has been there longer than his current Green Party colleagues.</p>
      <p>He said he's been thinking about retiring for some time.</p>
      <p>"I've gone through four elections and the question is do I want to contest a fifth election and I feel after ten years in Parliament it feels right.</p>
      <p>"My kids have grown up in a Parliamentay life not knowing anything else so I really want to now focus on them."</p>
      <p>Mr Hughes is looking at world-schooling his children; travelling and home schooling them.</p>
      <p>He said his focus during his career has been cleaner, cheaper, smarter energy and he believes the country is much closer to it than it was three years ago.</p>
      <p>Mr Hughes has been the party's chief musterer, the equivalent of a whip in other parties in the current Parliament.</p>
