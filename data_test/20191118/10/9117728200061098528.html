        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kimi-raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a> almost found himself on the podium for the first time since he left <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a>. <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/alfa-romeo-racing">Alfa Romeo</a> scored 22 points from an eventful <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a> but, in true Kimi style, Raikkonen is left disappointed. The Iceman was challenging <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> for what turned out to be a podium place after <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> was given a penalty. </b>

      <p>The Finnish Formula 1 driver was pleased with the big points but disappointed he couldn't get more. </p>
      <p><i>“It’s great to finally be able to celebrate our best result of the season as a team. It was a positive day and finally, we were able to get the result we worked so hard for. We kept on our own most of the race, but at the end, we were in the middle of the action,"</i> Raikkonen said. </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I am disappointed we couldn’t get past Sainz for what turned out to be the final podium position: we had the speed, got a good run on him twice but couldn’t get past. But you always want something more: in the end, it’s good to get big points with both cars.”</i>
