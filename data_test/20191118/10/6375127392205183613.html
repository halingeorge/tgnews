      <h3>THE House Committee on Ways and Means approved a measure that seeks to impose taxes on Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGO)</h3>
      <p>Members of the committee chaired by Albay Rep. Joey Salceda voted in favor of House Bill 5267 which seeks to tax companies  engaged in POGO and their workers.</p>
      <p>According to Salceda, the committee approved the 5 percent franchise tax on gross winning of POGOs licensed by Philippine Gaming Corp. (PAGCOR).</p>
      <p>It also approved .25 percent withholding tax with minimum threshold of P600,000 per annum for the Chinese workers.</p>
      <p>The bill also mandates PAGCOR to issue licenses after acquiring registration from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).</p>
      <p>Salceda stressed that with this measure the national government will be able to collect P45 billion more from the POGOs.</p>
      <p>“While the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has issued Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 102-2017 which clarified the tax treatment for these facilities and associated services, a law that settles questions of taxability, through amendments in the National Revenue Code, will once and for all address confusion on the taxation of this emerging industry,” Salceda said.</p>
