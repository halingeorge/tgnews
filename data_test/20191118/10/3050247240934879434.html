      <h3>Bitcoin hovers at decisive $8,400 level</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD attempting to crack the $8,500 level on Monday, only to see rejection after <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-showing-signs-of-recovery-while-btc-stalls-above-8500">falling from $8,600</a> late on Sunday. </p>
      <p>At press time, the pair traded around $8,450 - a crucial area which analysts suggest could dictate whether the mood going forward is bullish or bearish. </p>

      <p>“Do or die for the Bulls. This level needs to hold,” regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a> summarized in private comments.</p>
      <p>In his most recent <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1196103417741139969">Twitter update</a>, van de Poppe added that while the overall situation was “still not bad,” losing support at $8,400 would open up the potential for Bitcoin to return to $7,400. The move would mark a return to levels broken last month in an abrupt bull run which took the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a> to over $10,500. </p>
      <p>Other sources were also weary, with trader <a href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1196142838901293057">Scott Melker</a> eyeing a breakdown in Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI). A measure of price change, RSI breaking resistance can spill over to impact on Bitcoin price.</p>
      <p>“RSI has broken through both major descending resistances. Price usually follows,” Melker said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rsi-pattern-suggests-a-new-market-cycle-has-begun/">reported</a>, RSI action suggests Bitcoin is now at the start of a new extended price cycle.</p>
      <h3>Altcoins return to red</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoins</a> meanwhile halted their weekend advance to turn broadly negative as the week began. </p>
      <p>Across the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap, most coins fell by around 1.5% on the day. Among the exceptions was market leader Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), which managed to stave off losses and trade sideways at $183.</p>

      <p>Tezos (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tezos">XTZ</a>) managed a stronger performance, rising 3% to hit $1.19, while VeChain (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/vechain">VET</a>) achieved 2.8% gains and Cardano (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cardano">ADA</a>) 4.3%.</p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap stood at $234.3 billion, with Bitcoin’s share at 65.9%.</p>
