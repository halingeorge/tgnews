      <p>Hollywood superstar Ben Affleck and the Justice League have finally united in the Snyder Cut movement.</p>
      <p>Affleck tweeted a simple #ReleaseTheSnyderCut yesterday to let fans know he wants <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/22/hope-zack-snyder-cut-justice-league-just-7651950/">Zack Snyder’s cut of the Justice League film </a>to be out for the public to see. The 47-year-old posted just hours after Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot also tweeted in support of the Snyder Cut.</p>
      <p>This is all a bit confusing, but basically the Snyder Cut is referring to another version of Justice League that was shot but not released.</p>
      <p>The film came out on 17 November 2017 and Affleck starred alongside Gal Gadot, Jason Mamoa as Aquaman and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/05/justice-leagues-zack-snyder-reveals-henry-cavill-landed-superman-role-posing-christopher-reeves-original-costume-7523297/">Henry Cavill, playing superman</a>, among others.</p>
      <p>It was sort of supposed to be DC’s version of the Avengers, bringing popular superheroes together into one film.</p>
      <p>Yet Justice League did nowhere near as well as Avengers at the box office. It only brought in $657.9 million (£507.7 million) worldwide against a budget of $300 million (£231.5 million) and reviews released at the time were pretty negative.</p>

      <p>The movie had a last minute change, replacing director Zack Snyder with Avengers writer and director Joss Whedon in post-production.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Then when rumours started flying that there was a Snyder version of the film out there somewhere, fans were keen to see it.</p>

      <p>Hence the Snyder Cut.</p>
      <p>Snyder and others who worked on the original cut began releasing pictures of that version. Then actor Jason Momoa out and out confirmed he’d seen the Snyder version, saying ‘I think the public needs to see it’.</p>
      <p>Momoa added: ‘I’m obviously indebted to Warner and DC and I don’t know how they feel about it, but as a fan, I’m very, very happy I got to see it.’</p>

      <p>Then director Kevin Smith also confirmed the existence of a Snyder Cut on podcast <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477511/kevin-smith-says-zack-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-is-real-studio-would-be-silly-not-to-release-it">CinemaBlend</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve not seen it firsthand,’ he explained. ‘And also to be clear, I know Zack, but it’s not like ‘we’re f*****g tight son!’ That being said, I’ve spoken now to enough people at various levels in that production.</p>
      <p>‘There is a Snyder cut. For sure. That’s not a mythical beast. It exists. Now, it’s not a finished movie by any stretch of the imagination.’</p>
      <p>So Affleck joining the movement has just filled us with even more hope the Snyder Cut will actually happen.</p>

      <p>Snyder revealed <a href="https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/11/17/guardians-of-the-galaxy-zach-levi-almost-cast-star-lord-james-gunn-confirms/">on Comic Book</a> earlier in the year that Warner Brothers chose to go with a lighter version of the film rather than his cut, which was much darker.</p>

      <p>‘The truth is that the Knightmare sequence in this movie was always my idea that all of that would eventually be explained … and that we would end up in the distant future, where Darkseid has taken over Earth and where Superman has succumbed to the Anti-Life [Equation] …</p>
      <p>‘There were a few members of the Justice League that had survived in that world, that they were fighting.</p>
      <p>‘Batman broke a pact with Cyborg because something happened… They were working on an equation to jump Flash back to tell Bruce…’</p>
      <p>We literally have to see this cut.</p>
