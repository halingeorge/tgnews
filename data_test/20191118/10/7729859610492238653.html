      </p>
      <p>The 'Great Coaching Moment of the Year' award celebrates the moments that distinguish a coach from their focus on a sporting result to their focus on the person or people they are working with.</p>
      <p>Southgate received his nomination for the decision-making and leadership qualities he showed in supporting England's players and backroom staff as they managed the <a href="https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/11835902/england-players-racially-abused-in-bulgaria">racism which marred England's European Qualifier against Bulgaria</a> in September.</p>

      <p>Klopp has been recognised for masterminding<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/liverpool-vs-barcelona/406466"> Liverpool's Champions League comeback against Barcelona</a>, where his side overturned a 3-0 first-leg loss to qualify for the Champions League final with a dramatic 4-0 victory at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Southgate and Klopp are joined on the shortlist by John Blackie, who helped<a href="https://www.skysports.com/more-sports/athletics/news/29175/11825638/dina-asher-smith-wins-200m-gold-at-world-athletics-championships"> Dina Asher-Smith to two gold medals at the World Athletics Championships</a> in Doha.</p>
      <p>While Adam Peaty's longtime coach, Mel Marshall, completes the line-up having helped the British swimmer to another <a href="https://www.skysports.com/more-sports/swimming/news/29177/11767709/adam-peaty-breaks-100m-breaststroke-world-record">100m breaststroke world record</a> and World Aquatics Championship golds.</p>

      <p>"I'm so proud and happy to hear that John has been shortlisted for the Great Coaching Moment of the Year," Asher-Smith said of Blackie's nomination.</p>
      <p>"I would not be the woman and athlete I am today without his hard-work, selflessness and patience, and for that I will be forever grateful. John puts athletes first and I think he would be a worthy winner of this award."</p>

      <p>"Mel shares the dreams of her athletes and has enabled me to grow not just as a swimmer, but also as a person, both physically and mentally. Mel is an incredible coach and she's also an incredible person."</p>
