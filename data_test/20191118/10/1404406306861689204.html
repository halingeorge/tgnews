      <p>J. Cole took to Twitter to share his thoughts on <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259022/colin-kaepernick-tells-nfl-stop-running-from-the-truth-after-workout">Colin Kaepernick's NFL workout</a> on Saturday, tweeting, "Me thinking the NFL was about to do the right thing," which was followed by several clown emojis. </p>
      <p>Jay-Z reportedly pushed for the workout following backlash for his partnership with the NFL earlier this year. Sources close to Jay say that he was disappointed after Kaepernick moved the workout to more favorable conditions at an Atlanta-area high school. One source said that Hov was also let down after feeling that Kaepernick turned the workout into a publicity stunt, as Kaep asked to film a Nike ad during the workout. </p>
