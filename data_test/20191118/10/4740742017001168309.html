      <h1>New set of guidelines for councillors and officers published following LGA criticism</h1>
      <h2>But councillors are criticising how long it takes officers to respond to them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:08:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Postans</a></address>
      <p>Frustrated councillors criticised delays by City Hall officers replying to their requests for information — as they agreed new rules enshrining “mutual respect and harmony”.</p>
      <p>Opposition members also hit out at the “glaring omission” that while they were approving the new member/officer protocol, there was no similar set of guidelines governing the mayor’s behaviour.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> has been forced to draw up the new set of rules to help staff and elected members work better together following criticism by the Local Government Association.</p>
      <p>A peer review report in September 2018 revealed instances of dysfunction and animosity between them and recommended updating the guidance setting out how the two distinct roles in the authority should treat each other.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservative</a> Cllr Peter Abraham told full council the seven-day time limit in receiving information back from officers, as set down in the updated document, was often not met.</p>
      <p>He said: “The lack of replies and the timing of replies is not acceptable.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Abraham told the meeting on Tuesday (November 12) that he wrote a “very urgent” email to an officer about a constituent on October 24 but had not even received an acknowledgement, let alone an answer.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s all very good to stand here and talk about it tonight but if we don’t do it, the whole thing falls down.</p>
      <p>“My appeal is that we monitor what the replies are because it does need an audit of being able to check whether this is being carried out.”</p>
      <p>He said councillors and officers had “seemed to have forgotten” they had a protocol, which was “basically being ignored”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Lib Dem</a> Cllr Anthony Negus said: “Getting the information at the right time in the right form is paramount. We should all fight for that.”</p>
      <p>But he said the new rules were an achievement “in large part because of the way officers responded” during the process of drawing them up.</p>
      <p>“There should be more about member-to-member protocols and there certainly should be mayor-to-member protocols, and that is an absence,” he said.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/green-party">Green</a> group leader Cllr Eleanor Combley said: “When we have a reporting structure with a mayor at its head, it is hard to trust that officers can remain politically neutral, and when we have had experience of obfuscation such as over the payout of the previous chief exec, it gets hard to trust full stop.</p>
      <p>“There is a glaring omission that after seven years as a mayoral authority, Bristol still has no protocol governing the behaviour of the mayor or his office.”</p>
      <p>She said one welcome change was the updated guidelines made it clearer there should be an assumption of openness of information which should be made public unless there was a reason to conceal it, rather than hiding it unless there was a need to know.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Cllr Harriet Bradley said: “A key message is the need for mutual respect so that we can all work together in harmony and partnership.</p>
      <p>“That is necessary if we’re going to provide successful and effective local government for our citizens.</p>
      <p>“The savage cuts to council funding over past years have had a negative impact on us all.</p>
      <p>“Officers have seen their jobs enlarged, their staff cut and financial resources dwindle.</p>
      <p>“This inevitably causes stress and frustration at not being able to deliver the services they would like to.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile us members have had to pick up extra tasks and have had to deal with increasingly angry constituents facing reduced services.</p>
      <p>“We are all human beings and all of us can lose it at times, but my plea to fellow councillors is that they respect the pressure officers are under, acknowledge their professional expertise and the need for political neutrality at all times.</p>
      <p>“To the officers I would like to plead that they respond to councillors’ queries within the agreed time limit and that they respect the fact that as councillors we have an intimate knowledge of our wards which inevitably an officer dealing with the whole of the city cannot have, and our knowledge can be useful to them in informing effective policy.</p>
      <p>“If we both behave like that, we can achieve the desired partnership.”</p>
      <p>Members unanimously approved the new protocol as official council policy.</p>
      <p>The LGA’s 2018 peer report said: “Between members and officers, for the most part we saw and heard about respectful relationships.</p>
      <p>“However, this was not universally so and in some areas we heard examples where the opposite was true.”</p>
