      <p><b>Parliament Winter Session 2019 Live Telecast: </b>Speaking in Rajya Sabha to mark the 250th Session of the Upper House, Prime Minister <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> on Monday described the historic moment as a journey of opinions. PM Modi said he was honoured to be part of the historic session. “Rajya Sabha is eternal and diverse in nature. The 250th session shows that we have come a long way. It is a moment of pride for our democracy,” PM Modi said. Rajya Sabha is soul of country’s federal structure, he added.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> raised the issue of withdrawal of SPG cover of party’s interim president <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a> and her children <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/rahul-gandhi/">Rahul Gandhi</a> and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the Lok Sabha. The Congress-led opposition parties also raised the issue of National Congress MP Farooq Abdullah’s detention for the last three months at his residence in Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition MPs raised slogans on the floor of the House against the government and demanded the release of Abdullah. Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Choudhary said that the NC leader should be allowed to attend the Parliament session. “It has been 108 days today since Farooq Abdullah Ji was detained. We want that he should be brought to the Parliament. It is his constitutional right,” he said. Earlier this morning, PM Narendra Modi expressed the hope that the Winter session of Parliament will be a productive one with high quality debates in which all MPs will contribute through their intellect.
