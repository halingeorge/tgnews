      <p>The brave Fife gran also lost both legs to the deadly infection sparked by a paper cut.</p>
      <p>She is now searching for a publisher so she can share her survival story Sepsis: Raw and Real with the world.</p>
      <p>Margeurite, of Crosshill, said: “I had to be brutally honest with myself and at times I had to stop because looking back was too upsetting and painful.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been through so much and found myself fighting to be the person I was, instead of coming to terms who I am today.</p>
      <p>I know there are people who will want to read what I’ve been through.</p>
      <p>“I may have lost parts of my body, my job and even my boyfriend but the experience brought me so much closer to my family.”</p>
      <p>We told how the seamstress <a href="http://bit.ly/2rLJon8">spent a week in an induced coma</a> having almost died from the poisoned finger in February 2018.</p>
      <p>Surgeons removed her limbs amid fears of a relapse.</p>
