      <p>A consultation on the proposed relief road in Cullompton is taking place next week.</p>
      <p>There will be a permanent unmanned display at the Hayridge Library between November 19 and December 20. </p>
      <p>There will be two exhibitions with the project team. One on Saturday, November 23 November from 9:00 am until noon and another on Thursday, November 28, from 6:00 pm until 8:30 pm at the Hayridge Library in Cullompton. </p>

      <p>Those behind the relief road say that it will help ease congestion within Cullompton as well as poor air quality, housing limitations and associated restrictions on economic growth.</p>
      <p>The Cullompton Town Centre Relief Road was proposed to move traffic away from Fore Street and the town centre. It was first included in the Allocation and Infrastructure Development Plan Document in 2011. The road has also been in the Mid Devon Local Plan since 2013. It’s hoped a relief road would reduce queuing on both local and national roads and also help improve air quality and sustainable growth of the town.</p>
      <p>Growth in Cullompton outlined in the Local Plan is unlikely to be achieved with the current road network. Any more development would result in large queues on Station Road in the morning peak. This increases the negative impact on air quality within the Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). In the evening peak, queuing is likely to reach the motorway off-slips and potentially the mainline, leading to safety issues.</p>
