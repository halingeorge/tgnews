      <p>Caring villagers have raised hundreds of pounds for a Repton pensioner who saw her house wrecked by flood water.</p>
      <p>Carol Checkett was forced out of her <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/repton">home in Brook End, Repton</a>, by last week's floods.</p>
      <p>Many of her belongings were wrecked when eight inches of water seeped into the ground floor on Thursday, November 14, and Mrs Checkett's house is still uninhabitable.</p>
      <p>But now a crowd-funding page on JustGiving.com has been set up to help Mrs Checkett repair her home and replace ruined belongings.</p>
      <p>The page has already reached £400 - 80 per cent of the £500 target - with the number of people who have donated to the cause hitting double figures.</p>

      <p>It comes after hours of rainfall saw communities submerged underwater across Burton and South Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>One of the worst-hit villages was Repton, particularly in Pinfold Lane and High Street.</p>
      <p>Sandbags could still be seen outside homes on Friday and into the weekend, while <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/weather">there was muddy water</a> on the roads.</p>
      <p>Mrs Checkett told Burton Live water had "ploughed" through her home, ruining much of the ground floor.</p>
      <p>She was forced to stay with her daughter in Barton under Needwood, as up to eight inches of water poured into her house on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The mum of two returned to <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/property/">find her home unrecognisable</a>, with muddy water squelching underfoot, while neighbours had moved furniture to limit damage.</p>
      <p>Mrs Checkett is currently unaware of the full extent of the damage and will continue to live with her daughter until the home is ready to move back into, but hopes it will be "as soon as possible".</p>
      <p>Initially she anticipated at least her washing machine, dishwasher, fridge and freezer would have to be scrapped.</p>
      <p>Arrangements are in place for professional cleaners to visit the house.</p>
      <p>The dedicated crowd-funding page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/ian-nadin?utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=Yimbyprojectpage&amp;utm_content=ian-nadin&amp;utm_campaign=projectpage-share-owner&amp;utm_term=GJGZjGXEw&amp;fbclid=IwAR2iWDl7VWYUHCY_CwjUJiTotfOZxffjXSg_lV04Ad38oNjPlnC6csngogs">can be found online here</a>.</p>
