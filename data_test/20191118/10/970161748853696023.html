      <p>Gabrielle Reese was 18 and decided she was ready to lose her virginity.</p>
      <p>She had met someone online and after chatting for three months, she wanted to meet up.</p>
      <p>But it wasn’t just one person she had fallen for – Gabrielle had been chatting to Jacob Boswell, now 45, and his girlfriend Megan Muirhead, now 45.</p>
      <p>She met them through a sugar daddy website and now she was preparing to fly 500 miles to meet them – and start a sexual relationship with them both.</p>
      <p>But three years on, all of them are happily together as a polyamorous throuple.</p>
      <p>Recalling their first encounter, Gabrielle, now 21, explained: ‘The whole thing was exciting and new. We all clicked very fast and there was a lot of chemistry – we were all involved that first night.</p>
      <p>‘There were positives. Jacob and Megan are both older, while I had no experience.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Losing my virginity to a guy and a girl, being bisexual, I got to experience all aspects of my sexuality, too. Girls are soft, delicate and nurturing, while men are more dominant.</p>
      <p>‘I’d never thought that much about how I would lose my virginity, but I guess it wasn’t what I predicted. I don’t have any regrets though.’</p>
      <p>Gabrielle says she had always fancied older guys and she didn’t have any romantic relationships with guys her age as a teenager.</p>
      <p>So, after turning 18, she joined a sugar daddy website, matching younger women with older men and, in October 2016, found software developers Jacob and Megan – deciding to fly out and meet them a few days before her 19th birthday.</p>

      <p>She told her parents data analyst Don, 46, who is only a year older than Jacob, and sales associate Kathea, 44 – but they weren’t happy with her decision.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I was very, very honest.</p>
      <p>‘Growing up, I’d warned my parents I wanted to marry someone their age, but  I think they thought I was joking.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve always known I liked older guys – and girls too – so when I saw on Jacob’s website profile that he had a girlfriend, too, he checked all the boxes.</p>
      <p>‘But I told my parents I was flying from Idaho to Utah for a first date with a couple I’d only Facetimed once before, so I do understand why they were concerned.’</p>

      <p>With Megan at work when she arrived, she spent the day with Jacob before meeting her that evening.</p>
      <p>When she arrived in Utah after her hour-long flight, Gabrielle spent the first day with Jacob, moving on to become a “throuple” that night and the following day.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Jacob and I went to their house and hung out, watching TV and got dinner.</p>
      <p>‘It was all very normal and that’s what we did when Megan finished work too.</p>
      <p>‘After spending our first night together Megan told me she loved me and she wanted me to move in – I was like, “Who knows?”</p>
      <p>‘That first night I lost my virginity. I was nervous about the whole experience – but in a good way. The nerves were worth it.</p>

      <p>‘I knew that I wanted to do it. I don’t think I could have had a better experience for my first time – it was so intimate and perfect.’</p>
      <p>Two days later, she went home but all three of them were constantly texting and wanted her to come back.</p>
      <p>‘I asked if they had been serious and they said they were 100% up for me moving in,’ she continued. ‘A month later that’s just what I did.</p>
      <p>‘This was my first ever relationship, I was moving in after meeting them once, and being invited straight into a shared bedroom – it was a huge adjustment.</p>
      <p>‘It did feel weird at times, but I think anyone’s first relationship does, and at the same time, somehow it just worked.’</p>

      <p>While the “triad” enjoy a healthy love life, Gabrielle is conscious of outsiders ridiculing their relationship and making out it is purely sexual.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve never had anyone say anything negative to my face, but you can see it in their faces as soon as they find out,” she said.</p>
      <p>‘People tend to sexualise it and ask a lot of invasive questions that they would not ask anyone else.</p>
      <p>“They ask how it works and whether we are happy – like they have a right to know.</p>
      <p>‘But with any relationship there’s problems and the only difference is we have one extra person.</p>
      <p>‘An extra person requires extra passion, extra patience and extra compassion – of course, we have ups and downs.’</p>
      <p>Despite her love for Megan and Jacob, several months ago, Gabrielle decided to move to a small apartment nearby to get some independence.</p>
      <p>She said. ‘I was so young when I moved out here that I hadn’t really seen very much of life.</p>
      <p>‘But we’re coming up for three years as a triad now and we’re completely solid.</p>
      <p>‘My family know how happy I am now and they’ve come to accept our relationship.’</p>
      <p>Looking to the future, Gabrielle is keen at some point to start a family and although they can’t legally marry, they would like to have a ceremony.</p>
      <p>Gabrielle says she is ‘monogamous with two partners’ but is open to the idea of opening up their relationship.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not 100 per cent a closed relationship and if someone ever wants to do that we’ll sit down and discuss it, but it’s definitely not something any of us could, or would, do on a whim,’  she said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Jacob is keen to extol the virtues of polyamory – where people enjoy intimate relationships with more than one partner.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘Being poly is an amazing emotional challenge and, like everything else difficult, it’s incredibly rewarding when it works out.</p>
      <p>‘You’ve just got to keep working on this incredible, beautiful ride.</p>
      <p>‘I definitely get more of a reaction from people about the age gap than being poly, though.</p>
      <p>“When people hear I have two girlfriends they always go, “Well done” but when they hear about the age gap they imply it’s not ok, as if I am cradle snatching.</p>
      <p>‘It’s very demeaning, as Gabrielle is smart, brilliant and intelligent – she doesn’t need saving. Give her some credit, please.’</p>
      <p>Megan, who has been in a relationship with Jacob for 11 years, explained that while the couple experimented with dating other women, Gabby was the first to come into their relationship to form a triad.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I don’t share our relationship status with that many people so I can’t speak for what other people think about us all too much.</p>
      <p>‘Jacob and I are almost 15 years apart but people don’t have an issue with the age or the polyamory separately – they seem shocked by the whole package.</p>
      <p>‘Although I didn’t lose my virginity to Jacob I guess you could say in a way, we all lost our throuple virginity together.’</p>
