      <h1>Ronda Rousey confirms WWE retirement after Total Divas episode</h1>
      <h2>UFC legend Ronda Rousey has previously spoken about quitting WWE and starting a family with husband Travis Browne. Her last wrestling appearance came at Wrestlemania</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:20:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Ronda Rousey has hinted that her WWE career is over after her Wrestlemania defeat.</p>
      <p>Former UFC champion Rousey hasn't been seen on any WWE show since her loss at the showpiece event at the MetLife Stadium in April.</p>
      <p>'Rowdy' suffered a defeat to Becky Lynch in the inaugural all-women main event, which also saw Charlotte Flair involved.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old joined the production in 2018, following the culmination of his MMA career, and became a regular on RAW.</p>
      <p>But Rousey promoted the upcoming episode of the reality TV series Total Divas, which will cover her historic match at Mania - claiming that was her "flaming glory."</p>

      <p>Rousey  <a href="https://twitter.com/RondaRousey/status/1195453129250111488">tweeted</a> : “#WrestleMania is finally here and I’m ready to go out in flaming glory!!! Don’t miss the climax of my @WWE career on @totaldivas.”</p>
      <p>Ex-Olympian has previously hinted about moving away from the sport and creating a family with husband Travis Browne.</p>
      <p>“It just sort of snowballed into, instead of being like, a small detour in my life, became my whole life for an entire year and I completely fell in love with it," she said on her YouTube channel.</p>

      <p>"As time went on in the company I ended up getting the title and it became a real possibility that women could be the main event in WrestleMania.</p>
      <p>“I decided to stick around and we planned, after WrestleMania, me and my amazing husband here would go off and start trying to start our family.</p>
      <p>“As for WWE plans in the future, we want to have a baby first. I don’t know what it’s like to have a baby.</p>
      <p>“I could look down at this beautiful child and be like, ‘F*** everything, I don’t care about anything else other than this baby’ and, you’ll never see me again."</p>
      <p>Treple H insisted last month that wrestling fans would see Rousey back in the WWE ring "sooner rather than later".</p>
      <p>The former WWE world champion confirmed: "She's coming back."</p>
