      <p>The <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/403472/whenuapai-welcome-charles-and-camilla-arrive-for-nz-tour">Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall</a> will spend a week travelling the country from Waitangi to Christchurch.</p>
      <p>It begins today with a wreath-laying ceremony at the Mt Roskill War Memorial in Auckland which is customary for the royals.</p>
      <p>They will then visit various locations in the city, including the Wesley Community Centre and Hunting Lodge Vineyard in Waimauku.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow will bring more variety, with the couple splitting up to focus on issues close to their hearts.</p>
      <p>In the morning, they will have a private audience with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and National Party leader Simon Bridges.</p>
      <p>The Duchess, Camilla, will make a trip to Shine, a domestic violence service provider that helps thousands of victims each year. She has long-championed the rights of rape, sexual abuse and domestic violence victims in the United Kingdom and around the world.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles will meet with Sea Cleaners, an organisation dedicated to the protection of New Zealand's coastline and marine life.</p>
      <p>Since its establishment in 2002, Sea Cleaners has collected more than 85 million pieces of rubbish from the sea and coast.</p>
      <p>The couple will then meet up at Auckland's Wynyard Quarter, where they will greet the public and Emirates Team New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Later, the Duchess will host a Women of the World afternoon tea, while Prince Charles attends a tea for the Prince's Trust New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The trust focuses on supporting young people to realise their potential through education, and create startup businesses.</p>
      <p>Wednesday is the most significant day for the couple as they visit the Waitangi Treaty Grounds.</p>
      <p>It's been 25 years since any royal has visited Waitangi, and is the first visit since the Crown's 'expression of regret' for the events of Captain Cook's first landing.</p>
      <p>While they are there, the pair will plant a tree and walk through Te Kōngahu - the Museum of Waitangi.</p>
      <p>Later in the day, the Duchess of Cornwall will visit Kerikeri Primary School where she will meet students and learn about the 'Enviroschools programme.'</p>
      <p>The programme encourages children to design and lead sustainability projects in their local community.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla will take a well-deserved break before jetting off to the Garden City on Friday.</p>
      <p>There they will visit Tuahiwi Marae, Cashmere High School, Tūranga Library and Lincoln University.</p>
      <p>The pair will also visit Cathedral Square, and the Prince of Wales will inspect the site of the Christchurch Cathedral.</p>
      <p>Later, the Duchess will visit the Battered Women's Trust, which has been running since 1976 and offers long-term support for victims of domestic violence.</p>
      <p>She will also visit the botanic gardens and meet employees there.</p>
      <p>While this happens, Prince Charles will travel to Kaikōura where he will visit Takahanga Marae, go on a public walk and meet an endangered sea bird.</p>
      <p>The bird, known as Hutton's Shearwater, only breeds in Kaikōura and is the only known seabird in the world to breed in an alpine environment.</p>
      <p>It is considered to be a conservation success story, which will be discussed when the Prince meets Department of Conservation staff and volunteers.</p>
