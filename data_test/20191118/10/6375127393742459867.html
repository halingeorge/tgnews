      <h3>VOTING 185-1 with seven abstentions, the House of Representatives yesterday approved on third and final reading the Malasakit Center Bill.</h3>
      <p>House Bill 5477 institutionalizes the Malasakit Centers in all Department of Health (DOH) hospitals and the Philippine General Hospital.</p>
      <p>The House adopted Senate Bill 1076, a pet bill of Senator Bong Go.</p>
      <p>The bill seeks to create Makasakit centers in all DOH hospitals and the PGH to serve as a one-stop-shop for medical and financial assistance.</p>
      <p>During the mid-term elections, Go had the establishment of Malasakit Centers as his campaign promise for the people to have better healthcare and for the patients to get relief from the high cost of hospitalization.</p>
      <p>Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman opposed the measure saying it was just a carbon copy and that most of the amendments were ignored.</p>
      <p>Quezon Rep. Angelina Tan, sponsor of the bill, denied that the measure would add another bureaucratic layer for patients in need. Tan said the bill would simplify the process of providing medical and financial aid to Filipinos.</p>
      <p>Once enacted into law, the government will need P265.76 million to pay personnel services for 73 Malasakit centers, and another P15.73 million for the operation of a center or a program office.</p>
      <p>The centers would provide patient navigation and refer them to a health care provider network.</p>
