      <h1>The Walking Dead season 10: Main character dies in episode 7 twist</h1>
      <h2>Huge spoilers for the AMC drama’s latest episode within</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-walking-dead?CMP=ILC-refresh"><i>The Walking Dead</i></a> continued its tenth season with an episode featuring a shock death.</p>
      <p>This season so far has been quite tame by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/amc">AMC</a> zombie drama’s standards, but the most recent installment – titled “Open Your Eyes” – put a stop to that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>*Spoilers follow – you have been warned*</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over the past seven episodes, viewers have discovered that Siddiq (Avi Nash) has been suffering from PTSD after witnessing the Whisperers kill a number of his friends, including Enid (Katelyn Nacon) and Tara (Alanna Masterson).</p>
      <p>Thankfully, he’s had Alexandria’s new doctor, Dante (Juan Javier Cardenas), on hand to help him through his struggles; the past few episodes have seen the pair strike up a camaraderie, mainly thanks to Dante’s past experiences as a soldier.</p>
      <p>It turns out, though, that Dante is a Whisperers spy who has been playing Siddiq the whole time – and just as Siddiq realises this, Dante strangles him to protect his secret.</p>
      <p>Siddiq’s death comes after he discovered his fellow Alexandrians were falling ill after drinking an infected supply of water.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the character’s death scene, Nash told <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8099906/type/dlg/https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/17/walking-dead-siddiq-avi-nash-open-your-eyes/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>: “I was thrilled and excited to be tasked with such a powerful arc.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “[Siddiq’s] message of mercy helped resolve season eight, his commitment to family and the Grimes legacy brought the communities back together in season nine, and now, his untimely death – in Alexandria at the hands of a spy – might just be the lynchpin that sets off our heroes in season ten.”</p>
      <p>Nash joined the show in its eighth season.</p>
