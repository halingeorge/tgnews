      <p>While the Catalan giants sit at the top of the La Liga standings, three defeats from 12 matches have led to criticism of the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>However, despite Barcelona also performing inconsistently in the Champions League, Abidal has reiterated the club's support for their current boss.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman told <i>Sport</i>: "In these situations, you can think that the coach is to blame, but you have to analyse everything. What does the coach bring to the team and vice-versa? We support the coach and we give him all the information, although the day-to-day is his.</p>
      <p>"There are clubs that change coaches after bad results, but you always have to look at the wider situation. If the coach sees that it can be improved, you have to back him."</p>
      <p>Barcelona return to action when they take on Leganes on Saturday afternoon.</p>
