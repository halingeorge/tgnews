      <p>The Manchester City striker will return to the Albiceleste side as manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-scaloni/"><b>Lionel Scaloni</b></a> gets his final look at his team before the start of World Cup qualifying next year.</p>
      <p>Aguero, who sat out Friday's victory over Brazil in Saudi Arabia, and Barcelona playmaker Messi are the only players Scaloni has confirmed will definitely play.</p>
      <p>They could play in a front three with Inter Milan's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lautaro-martinez/"><b>Lautaro Martinez</b></a> or <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paulo-dybala/"><b>Paulo Dybala</b></a> of Juventus but Scaloni will wait before making the rest of his selection.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a press conference reported by TyC Sports, Scaloni said: "Let's wait a little longer. Some players are tired after the game against Brazil, which is normal for the game we had, but nobody has problems.</p>
      <p>"We will take half a day more because I would like to take a fresh team."</p>
      <p>Scaloni does not want to stray too far from his preferred side but recognises the game is a good opportunity to experiment.</p>
      <p>He said: "Beyond that is not ideal to try but as we consider it is the last before the qualifiers we can dare to try some players in an important game."</p>
      <p>The game is likely to see Messi come up against his Barcelona team-mate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luis-suarez/"><b>Luis Suarez</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Scaloni said: "We are going to play against a side that is one of the best in the world.</p>
      <p>"They have a mix of youth and experience at the top level, and we know how dangerous they are."</p>
