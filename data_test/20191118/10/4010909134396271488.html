      <p>Ever since Facebook owned Instagram, the company has tried to add in features into the latter and also import features from Instagram to Facebook simultaneously. Today, according to a <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/facebook_tests_popular_photos-news-40138.php">report</a>,<b> Instagram may be rolling out a new feature named “Popular Photos” soon!</b></p>
      <p>This new feature will allow you to see recommended photos from your friends and also other public posts that is curated for you when you clicked into a full-screen mode on a post. This works the same way with Facebook recommended posts which you will get to scroll down and see other videos whenever you played a video on full-screen mode.</p>

      <p>The photos that will appear out in the Popular Photos feed are chosen by the Facebook Algorithm and photos with a long caption will be truncated after 65 characters to make it less wordy on the feed. This feature has been concluded but there’s no confirmation on the launching date yet. <br/><br/>The "Popular Photos" feels like a great feature for users to get more exposure which helps friends to stay intact with your daily updates but what do you think of it?
