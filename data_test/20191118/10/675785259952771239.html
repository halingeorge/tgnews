      <h2>Man City are eyeing a January swoop for Red Bull Leipzig's Dayot Upamecano who has been tracked by Arsenal and Tottenham</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> are weighing up a bid for Red Bull Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano who was considered by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Premier League champions are struggling in defence having lost Aymeric Laporte until the New Year.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's cover has not impressed with John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi both making errors which could push him into the transfer market.</p>
      <p>The Catalan has said he won't buy in January, but should injuries force his hand he wants to sign players who can benefit the club beyond his tenure.</p>

      <p>That is why Upamecano, who is only 21-years-old, and Benfica's Rúben Dias have been highlighted as potential signings.</p>
      <p>Arsenal as well as north London rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> tracked the youngster, but it now looks as if City can jump to the front of the queue.</p>
      <p>Guardiola is particularly demanding when it comes to recruitment and especially when it comes to adding in defence which is why he chose not to replace Vincent Kompany in the summer.</p>

      <p>But City reckon both Upamecano and Dias are available for the right money should they choose to move.</p>
      <p>The Leipzig defender will enter the final 18 months of his deal come the turn of the year which makes him a more attractive proposition than Dias who has several years left in Lisbon.</p>
      <p>Upamecano has made close to 100 appearances for the German side who sit second in the Bundesliga under new manager Julian Nagelsmann.</p>

      <p>City's lack of defence has seen them play midfield anchor Fernandinho at the back, although that was always on Guardiola's agenda this season.</p>
      <p>But in their recent win at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> injuries forced the City boss to play Fernandinho and summer signing Rodri as his two central defenders.</p>
      <p>Fernandinho has provided sufficient cover, but he has been exposed in some games which has cost the champions who are nine-points behind leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a></p>
