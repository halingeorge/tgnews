      <h2>Russian government increases control after concerns over foreign ownership of its largest tech company</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:49:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">Max Seddon</a></address>
      <p>Yandex has agreed a restructuring with the Kremlin that increases government influence over Russia’s largest tech company and seeks to prevent it from ever falling under <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7bb99438-f711-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65">foreign control</a>.</p>
      <p>The company will create a new Public Interest Foundation that will have the power to block transactions and temporarily remove Yandex’s management if it deems it in the national interest.</p>
      <p>A golden share in Yandex, held by state-run Sberbank, will be transferred to the foundation.</p>
      <p>The new mechanism is the result of long negotiations with the Kremlin about how to ensure <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e5d70d68-00ae-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">Yandex </a>remains in Russian hands while allowing it to operate on global markets, according to people involved in the talks.</p>
      <p>The Kremlin is worried that the huge reams of user data Yandex controls in businesses from search and mobile advertising to taxis and food delivery could fall into foreign hands, the people said.</p>
      <p>“The internet today is like electricity 100 years ago. Yandex’s products are an essential part of people’s lives, and if something happens to them, it’s not just a problem for the company, but for all of society,” said Arkady Volozh, Yandex’s founder and chief executive, in an email to employees on Monday.</p>
      <p>“We needed to find a decision that would satisfy three sides by keeping management in our hands, reassuring foreign investors about Yandex’s business potential, and defending national interests.”</p>
      <p>Mr Volozh, who is also Yandex’s largest shareholder, said he would retain ultimate control over the company’s operations.</p>
      <p>Yandex executives will pitch US market investors, who own most of its free float, on the idea this week ahead of a vote at an extraordinary general meeting on December 20. The company also announced a $300m buyback of ordinary shares.</p>
      <p>Shares in Yandex rose 9 per cent on Nasdaq on the news.</p>
      <p>Mikhail Terentiev, an analyst at Sova Capital, described the news as “highly positive” in a note, saying the changes “have the potential to significantly reduce the regulatory risk the company faces” and “look much more palatable than some other possible outcomes feared by investors”.</p>

      <p>Maria Sukhanova, an analyst at BCS Global Markets, said that the move “addresses all relevant concerns voiced by state officials while retaining the current shareholder structure of the company, and with no significant impact for Yandex’s minority holders”.</p>
      <p>The Kremlin had been worried about the fate of Yandex if Mr Volozh sold down his stake. Through preference shares, Mr Volozh owns 48.5 per cent of the voting rights and controls the company together with other Yandex employees.</p>
      <p>Under the new arrangement, Mr Volozh will pledge not to sell 95 per cent of his preference shares during a two-year lock-up period. He will also create a family trust to prevent his preference shares reverting to ordinary shares — thus giving US investors effective control over Yandex — for two years in the event of his untimely death.</p>
      <p>Yandex’s shares fell by 18 per cent last month, wiping $1.5bn off its market capitalization, after a preliminary hearing for a new law that would severely restrict foreign investment in “significant information resources” to prevent other governments obtaining Russian user data.</p>
      <p>Anton Gorelkin, the MP who authored the bill, said on Monday he was “pleasantly surprised” by Yandex’s decision and would withdraw the draft law indefinitely.</p>
      <p>The non-governmental foundation is modelled after a Dutch stichting, an ownerless special-purpose vehicle often used to separate ownership from control and protect assets from hostile takeovers. Its board is made up of representatives from five Russian universities, three Russian NGOs, and three top Yandex executives. </p>
      <p>The foundation will be able to veto any single shareholder obtaining more than 10 per cent of Yandex’s shares.</p>
      <p>The foundation will nominate two directors to new seats on Yandex’s board: Alexei Yakovitsky, chief executive of Kremlin investment bank VTB Capital, and Alexei Komissarov, head of Moscow’s Higher School of Public Administration. </p>
      <p>The new directors will effectively represent the state’s interests in Yandex. They will be able to veto some board appointments and join a “social interests committee” with Mr Volozh that will allow it to veto the transfer of Yandex’s intellectual property, change Yandex’s policy on Russian users’ personal data, and possible future partnerships with foreign governments. </p>
      <p>The foundation can also temporarily replace Yandex’s top executive in Russia in “exceptional circumstances” if Yandex’s board “deliberately ignores the foundation’s decisions, hinders its work, or makes decisions that could affect national security”.</p>
      <p>Sberbank agreed to hand over its “golden share” — which only gives it a veto on transactions of 25 per cent of Yandex’s shares — after the companies increasingly began to compete, though chief executive Herman Gref will retain his seat on Yandex’s board, the people said. </p>
      <p>Relations between the companies soured after Mr Volozh rebuffed Mr Gref’s attempt to buy the company last year, sending Yandex’s share price tumbling 20 per cent. A provision voiding the “golden share” in the event Russia passes a law restricting foreign investment into Yandex will also expire.</p>
