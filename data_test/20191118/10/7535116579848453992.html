      <p>The incident, which took place at an unspecified private university, occurred <b>when students heard a loud thud in the university campus at 3.30pm</b>, before encountering the remains of a 19-year-old male student.</p>
      <p>It was reported that <b>the 19-year-old student had fallen from the fourth floor of his university’s library and died from severe head injuries</b> as a result of the fall. According to both English dailies,<b> the deceased was a bright young student who had not faced any problems in terms of finances</b>, and was able to make his school fee payments on time.</p>
      <blockquote>“However, the student had been contacted by his father one hour before the incident. The teen’s family had wanted to hand over some of his clothes and a necklace.” said Kuala Muda police chief Assistant Commissioner Adzli Abu Shah.</blockquote>
      <p>His family was supposed to have met him on campus grounds later that day, before his untimely death. He is the eldest of two children of his family.</p>
      <p>Investigations into the sudden death have also revealed that<b> the deceased was due to sit for an exam paper today (18th November 2019)</b>. Authorities are now currently <b>trying to determine if his death had been caused by examination stress and pressure</b>. <a href="https://www.sinarharian.com.my/article/57740/BERITA/Tragedi/Pelajar-cemerlang-maut-jatuh-bangunan">Sinar Harian</a> reports that he was a first semester student in the university.</p>
      <p>The incident is currently being ruled as ‘sudden death’.</p>
      <p>
        <i>We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the surviving members of the deceased’s family during this difficult time, and hope that he will be able to rest in peace. </i>
