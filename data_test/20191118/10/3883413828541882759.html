      <p>China has told the United States to 'stop flexing muscles in the South China Sea', during closed-door talks between defence officials.</p>
      <p>Representing the two world superpowers, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe met in Bangkok to discuss tense relations.</p>
      <p>According to a spokesperson, Mr Fenghe called on the US not to "provoke and escalate tensions" in the waters - which are rich in oil and gas reserves. </p>

      <p>China claims most of the busy waterway, with military outposts on several artificial islands. </p>
      <p>The US believes China of trying to intimidate Asian neighbours such as Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam - also with claims to some shares of the sea, through large-scale militarisation.</p>
      <p>The United States Navy regularly carries out “freedom of navigation” operations close to Chinese-occupied islands.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, which Mr Esper has called an effort towards continued relations "focused on maintaining the international rules-based system" followed for decades, Mr Fenghe said:</p>
      <p>"We [call on] the U.S. side to stop intervening in the South China Sea and stop military provocation in the South China Sea."</p>

      <p>One day prior to the meeting, Mr Esper accused Beijing of "increasingly resorting to coercion and intimidation to advance its strategic objectives" in the area.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, the pair also discussed recent protests in Hong Kong and democratic Taiwan - which is claimed by China.</p>
      <p>Mr Fenghe said China would "not tolerate any Taiwan independence incident".</p>
      <p>China has previously threatened to attack Taiwan if it moves towards independence.</p>
      <p>The previous day, as Mr Esper criticised China's intimidation strategies, China marked the start of Taiwan's presidential election campaigns by sailing a carrier group into Taiwan Strait.</p>
