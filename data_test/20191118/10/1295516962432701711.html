      <p>Matthew Perry has officially approved of a comparison between his popular <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/friends/">Friends</a></i> character Chandler Bing and Joaquin Phoenix's take on the iconic DC villain <a href="http://cbr.com/tag/joker"><i>Joker</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The actor shared an image comparing Chandler's iconic dance moves to that of Arthur Fleck's as the character, in full Joker regalia, struts down a flight of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-fan-video-uncut-stairway-dancing-scene/">now-famous stairs</a>. Above the image are the words "cinematic parallels," and Perry accompanied the tweet with the caption "You're welcome," adding, "Sorry I don't know who made the image, but bravo."</p>

      <p>It was recently announced that Perry would be joining his old costars from the '90s sitcom for an <a href="https://www.cbr.com/friends-reunion-special-hbo-max/">unscripted reunion special</a> on HBO Max. The deal is allegedly "far from done and agreements with cast and creatives still need to be hammered out." Despite this, "the cast is willing to do it."</p>
      <p><i>Friends</i> premiered Sept. 2, 1994. The sitcom became a critically acclaimed favorite and ran for 10 seasons, concluding its run in 2004. The series in its entirety will stream exclusively on HBO Max at launch.</p>
