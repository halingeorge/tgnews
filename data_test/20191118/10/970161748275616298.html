        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bastille/">Bastille</a> singer Dan Smith is estimated to be missing out on big bucks right now. It’s said the musician could have earned £150,000 from his John Lewis Christmas advert song but fans have been unable to stream the track as it’s yet to be released.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 33-year-old singer recorded a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/when-reo-speedwagon-john-lewis-christmas-advert-song-released-11090426/">cover of REO Speedwagon’s Can’t Fight This Feeling</a> for this year’s festive <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/john-lewis-christmas-2019-edgar-dragon-11088313/">John Lewis campaign featuring Excitable Edgar</a>.</p>
      <p>It arrived last week and fans heaped praise on Dan’s stunning cover of the hit 80s power ballad, but were confused when they couldn’t find it on streaming platforms like Spotify or Apple Music.</p>
      <p>Well, John Lewis have now confirmed the song will be released this week – likely Friday – but it’s still missed out on big earnings from the past week.</p>
      <p>According to a new Pay Per Play <a href="https://broadbanddeals.co.uk/pay-per-play/">study from BroadbandDeals.co.uk</a>, Dan could have earned £150,000 in the week since the John Lewis advert debuted.</p>

      <p>While Dan’s cover of Can’t Fight This Feeling has gone down well with fans, it remains to be seen whether it can top the success of Lily Allen’s John Lewis Christmas advert song.</p>
      <p>The Smile singer recorded a cover of Keane’s Somewhere Only We Know for the retailer’s 2013 advert and it’s currently the brand’s most streamed advert song yet with over 189.6 million plays to date on Spotify.</p>

      <p>According to the study, this has generated profits of £647,311.68 through Spotify alone based on the £0.0034 that is paid for one stream.</p>
      <p>It means Lily – or her record company – has likely earned more from Spotify than the amount John Lewis reportedly paid her for the advert.</p>

      <p>In 2014, Lily told Beat magazine: ‘Everyone assumes I made millions from the John Lewis ad but I probably made £8,000.’</p>
      <p>That sure does sound like a pittance when taking into account reports that the 2013 John Lewis ad cost £6 million to make.</p>

      <p>Following behind Lily is Ellie Goulding in second place with Your Song, which is named the second most streamed John Lewis Christmas advert song after generation £487,300 since 2010.</p>
      <p>But of course, the real winner of Christmas is Mariah Carey whose classic 1994 hit All I Want For Christmas Is You, has earned over £1.7 million.</p>
