      <p>The pair will play a co-headline show at the Staffordshire beauty spot as part of the annual Forest Live shows.</p>
      <p>James Morrison is a singer-songwriter from Rugby, best known for hits such as Broken Strings, You Give Me Something and I Won't Let You Go.</p>
      <p>Will Young, meanwhile, rose to fame after winning Pop Idol in 2002. The Wokingham singer-songwriter is famed for songs including Leave Right Now, Evergreen and All The Songs.</p>
      <p>The concert will see both BRIT Award-winning artists perform individual sets that include greatest hits and material from their latest albums: Will’s ‘Lexicon’ and James’ ‘You’re Stronger Than You Know’.</p>
      <p>The pair will perform at Cannock Chase on Sunday, June 21.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the show, Will Young said: "Both James and I have fond memories of appearing as part of Forest Live as solo artists in the past.</p>
      <p>"We love the work Forestry England does, so we are glad to be back again in what promises to be a fantastic double-header of a show.”</p>
      <p>James Morrison added: "For the last 20 years Will has been at the forefront of British Popular Culture. That’s a massive achievement.</p>
      <p>"I think our sets will complement each other in a special way and I’m really looking forward to our shows together.</p>
      <p>"It’ll be a great night out."</p>
      <p>Forest Live is a major outdoor live music series held every year by Forestry England, raising money for the nation's woodlands.</p>
      <p>The trio of concerts will be held on Cannock Chase from June 19 to 21 next year.</p>
