      <p>With a growing reputation for creating artwork in an unorthodox fashion, an African artist recently created an astonishing portrait of Sadio Mane. Did you see it?</p>
      <p>A quick glance at the artist's Instagram account, and it’s safe to say he is no ordinary man of his craft.</p>
      <p>Known as "Bou Bou", the African artist uses random objects such as boxing gloves, machetes and hats in his painting process, with the end product being nothing short of spectacular.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Senegalese man painted a portrait of Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar by simply using his foot. As expected, his work went viral and had social media in awe.</p>

      <p>That being said, his most recent work caught the eye of many on the internet as he completed a painting of Liverpool's Mane by splattering paint on to a canvas off from a round object. Bou Bou later uploaded a time lapse video of how he created his Mane painting from start to finish.</p>
