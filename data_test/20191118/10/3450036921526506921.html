      <p>BARING, Mo. â€” A Heartland high school student is dead after he was shot while <a href="https://ktvo.com/news/local/one-killed-in-northern-missouri-hunting-incident-investigation-underway">deer hunting over the weekend.</a></p>
      <p>The tragedy happened at approximately 1 p.m. Sunday in Knox County on property north of Baring, Missouri.</p>
      <p>Knox County Coroner Alan Rimer identifies the victim as Andrew Howe, 17, of rural Baring.</p>
      <p>Rimer told KTVO Monday morning that Howe was deer hunting with his grandfather, Don Howe, 75, also of rural Baring.</p>
      <p>The coroner said it appears the elder Howe mistook his grandson for a deer and fatally shot Andrew in the head.</p>
      <p>Rimer said it appears to be an accident, but it is under investigation by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC).</p>
      <p>He said Andrew Howe was not wearing blaze orange when the shooting happened.</p>
      <p>Rimer pronounced the teen dead at the scene around 2 p.m. Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Knox County Sheriff's Office referred KTVO to the conservation department for further details.</p>
      <p>When we called the conservation department, an official would only say that the department is actively investigating a fatal hunting-related shooting in Knox County.</p>
      <p>MDC would not release any additional details at this time. The Missouri State Highway Patrol is also assisting with the investigation.</p>
      <p>Rimer said an autopsy will likely take place Tuesday in Columbia, Missouri.</p>
      <p>Andrew Howe was a senior at Knox County High School, and those who knew him said Howe had recently taken up bull riding and was pretty good at it.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Andy Turgeon told KTVO extra counselors will be at the school for most of the week to meet with any students who want to talk about their feelings regarding Howe's death.</p>
