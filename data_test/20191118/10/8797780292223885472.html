      <p>Is Anthem dead? With the game currently giving its players the silent treatment and BioWare having several big names jump ship, you wouldn’t be blamed for thinking so. Anthem in its current state is certainly a better game now than it was at launch, but it still suffers from a range of issues of which the primary one is that its the most boring thing on Earth since DSTV launched the Post Office Entertainment Service channel. [<i>Editor’s note: I’ve actually been playing Anthem since it dropped on EA Access, and it’s actually not bad at all. There’s a ton of promise, and a fair amount of fun to be had now, despite its glaring limitations – Kervyn</i>]</p>
      <p>Anthem may not have much life in its bones currently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">but over at Kotaku</a> there was a spark of hope that the live service Iron Man simulator could actually be, and brace yourselves for this one, exciting. Reports from the site indicate that Anthem is currently being heavily retooled behind the scenes, the entire game being stripped apart and rebuilt into a title that could be compared to what No Man’s Sky did with its NEXT update.</p>
      <p>How Anthem will play, its overall mission structure and what it’ll look like are all under a microscope across all of BioWare’s various studios as the company looks to salvage the project that at this point is simply too big to fail. “We spent a few months just tearing it down and figuring out what needed to change fundamentally (a lot),” one of Kotaku’s sources on the project said.</p>
      <blockquote>And we’ve been rebuilding for another few months since.</blockquote>
      <p>The biggest hurdle right now for Anthem is <i>how </i>it plans to introduce its grand rebuild plan. BioWare have no idea how they’ll do this currently, whether it’s through a massive expansion pack ala Destiny’s Taken King, several updates or a brand new game entirely that would create Anthem 2.0. Whatever the plan is, BioWare is gambling big on this rebuild focusing on maintaining the established lore of Anthem and overhauling the social elements, the world and progression through it so that major gripes can finally be addressed.</p>
      <p>This version of Anthem is currently in a state of deep experimentation, even after the departure of BioWare head of live services Chad Robertson and lead producer Ben Irving. A part of me wants Anthem to be fully realised as the game that it was hyped to be, instead of the broken at launch poster child of everything wrong with live service games that is currently running on life support and the scant goodwill of a faithful few.</p>
      <p>Everyone deserves a second chance, and I’m a big fan of comeback stories. Hopefully, Anthem can find the magic that BioWare truly needs.</p>
