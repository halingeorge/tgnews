      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:00:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/trends-desk/" target="_blank">Trends Desk</a></address>
      <p>Time and again, several “desi” products have made it to the western market and the recent one that has found its way to a grocery store in New Jersey is cow dung cake. While earlier this year it was the Amazon selling <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-in-india/coconut-shell-sold-at-very-high-price-shocks-indians-online-5540013/">‘natural’ coconut shells</a> for nearly Rs 1400, this grocery store in New Jersey is selling cow dung cakes for as much as $2.99 or Rs 215.</p>
      <p>“My cousin sent me this. Available at a grocery store in Edison, New Jersey. $2.99 only. My question: Are these imported from desi cows or are they from Yankee cows?” tweeted a user Samar Halarnkar along with a picture of packed cow dung cakes. On the packaging, the label notes that the product is for “religious purposes” and is not “eatable”.</p>
