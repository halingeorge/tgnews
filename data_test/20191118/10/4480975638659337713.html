      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“Along with the reduction in interest rates, the PBoC also added CNY 180bn of cash into the financial system via open market operations, helping to alleviate <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies">liquidity</a> concerns. Meanwhile, over the weekend <b>the PBOC’s quarterly report warned not only on growth risks but also on rising inflation</b>, highlighting the limited room that <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> has to respond.”</p>
      <p>“<b>The PBoC also said in the report that it will “increase counter-cyclical adjustment” to ward off downward pressure on the economy while adding that monetary policy will “properly handle the short-term pressure,” making sure not to offer excessive funding, while keeping an eye on the risk of expectations that inflation may spread.”</b></p>
