      <h1>The Man in the High Castle: Swastikas used in Amazon series ‘proudly destroyed’ after filming</h1>
      <h2>Props depicting Japanese Rising Sun imagery were also destroyed, actor confirms</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:50:57+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:50</time> by <a rel="author">Adam White</a></address>
      <p>Swastikas used in the making of the hit <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/amazon">Amazon</a> series <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-man-in-the-high-castle">The Man in the High Castle</a></i> have been “proudly destroyed” since production ended, one of its stars has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Actor Chelah Horsdal posted a video on Twitter that showed a leather prop with a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/swastika">swastika</a> drawn on it being cut into miniature pieces.</p>
      <p>The pieces are then shown being thrown into boxes. A message reading “Burn Pile” then appears on screen.</p>
      <p>“Super satisfying,” Horsdal wrote. “Reminder that <i>High Castle</i> proudly destroyed all the swastikas that were produced for the show.”</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/chelahhorsdal/status/1195761096650457088">a second tweet</a>, Horsdal confirmed that props used in the show depicting symbols of the Japanese Rising Sun had also been destroyed. “All flags and symbols that were in any way offensive or sensitive: destroyed,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>Not all of Horsdal’s followers were happy about the video, however, with some claiming that the swastikas could have been recycled, potentially for use in additional film and television productions.</p>
      <p>“Wow,” Horsdal wrote in response. “Lotta a**holes out there. Who knew the position ‘Nazi swastikas are bad’ would be so controversial.”</p>
      <p><i>The Man in the High Castle</i>, which was loosely adapted from a novel by Philip K Dick, was set in an alternate USA taken over by forces from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/nazi-germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the Empire of Japan in the aftermath of World War II. It recently debuted its final season on the streaming service.</p>
      <p>The show earned controversy upon its debut in 2015 when Amazon decided to promote the show by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/amazon-pulls-nazi-tv-ad-campaign-new-york-the-man-in-the-high-castle-irresponsible-and-offensive-a6747901.html">decorating the New York subway system in Nazi and Imperialist Japan-related imagery.</a></p>
      <p>After New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he found the ads “irresponsible and offensive”, Amazon pulled the campaign.</p>
