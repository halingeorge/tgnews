      <p>A group of Hindu pilgrims in southern India who were on their way to a hugely popular pilgrimage destination were surprised to discover that a stray dog was following them on their trek, and managed to cover a distance of 480 kilometres within 18 days.</p>
      <p>The pilgrims set out from Tirumala, a temple town in southern Andhra Pradesh, and made their way to Sabarimala in Kerala on foot, covering a distance of about 530 kilometres. A stray dog started following them in Tirumala and was spotted as they reached Chikkamangaluru district in southern Karnataka on Sunday (17 November); their new companion was still following them.  </p>

      <p>​The brown dog, who was wearing a collar, moved along with the small group, despite limping. Several of the pilgrims believed it was a divine spirit and fed it wherever they stopped for food, admiring the animal's tenacity.</p>
      <p>Sabarimala Temple has been in the news recently,; the<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077305978-indias-top-court-refuses-to-reverse-ruling-opening-hugely-popular-hindu-temple-to-women-of-all-ages/"> Supreme Court of India</a> decided to review its own judgement permitting women of all ages to enter the place of worship. Traditionally, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911171077329120-defying-court-order-police-bar-10-women-from-praying-at-ancient-temple-in-indian-state-reports/">women do not trek to the temple,</a> which is located in the midst of a forest on a hilly terrain, which is open to the annual trip between mid-November and mid-January every year.  Millions of pilgrims, mostly from southern India, visit the temple, which is dedicated to a celibate deity named Lord Ayyappa.</p>
      <p>While the top court refused to revise its original decision of September 2018, it referred the issue to a larger bench on the larger issue of entry of women entering the shrines of all religions.</p>
