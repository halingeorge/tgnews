        <b>Logitech has announced the all-new Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit, a new line of hardware designed to help gamers that require specific accessibility needs. </b>

      <p>As a collection of buttons and triggers created with “gamer-grade” components, the new accessible controller aims to be durable and performant.</p>
      <p>“The Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit is designed to be the perfect companion to the Xbox Adaptive Controller, giving gamers the necessary tools they need at a more affordable price point,” said vice president and general manager of Logitech Gaming, Ujesh Desai. “It also supports our commitment to inclusivity and diversity in gaming, because fundamentally we believe that life is more fun when you play, and everyone should be able to experience the joys of play.”</p>
      <p>The company claims that they worked alongside The AbleGamers ChaRitu, Special Effect, Abilities Research Center and the Microsoft Inclusive Lab to make sure the product satisfies the needs of those who game with a variety of different disabilities.</p>
      <p>“The Xbox Adaptive Controller opened up gaming to people with disabilities all around the world,” said Jenny Lay-Flurrie, chief accessibility officer at Microsoft. “With the addition of Logitech G’s Adaptive Gaming Kit, we’re excited to see that impact continue to grow. It’s never been more important to design through the lens of disability and push the boundaries of what technology can do to be inclusive of everyone around the world.”</p>
