      <p>Buddy Hield scored a season-high 35 points as the Sacramento Kings ended the Boston Celtics' 10-game winning streak with a 100-99 victory at the Golden 1 Center.</p>
      <p>Two free throws from Richaun Holmes with 13 seconds remaining proved decisive for the Kings, who made it five wins in seven matches having lost their opening five games.</p>
      <p>The Denver Nuggets continued their impressive form on the road as Jamal Murray's 39 points helped them to a 131-114 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>

      <p>Paul Millsap added 23 as the Nuggets secured a fifth win in six matches away from the Pepsi Center.</p>
      <p>Eric Paschall scored 30 points and Ky Bowman got 19 off the bench but the rookie duo could not prevent the injury-ravaged Golden State Warriors from slipping to a 108-100 defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>
      <p>Washington Wizards shooting guard Bradley Beal moved past 10,000 career points in his team's 125-121 defeat against the Orlando Magic, while Tobias Harris top-scored for the Philadelphia 76ers with 27 points in their 114-95 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
