      <p><b>The Valencia GP ended in the worst of ways for Johann Zarco</b>. Besides having fallen, the French rider was even mowed down by the<b> KTM ridden by rookie rider Lecuona. </b>Seeing the first images, everyone feared the worst for the LCR rider but, in the end, a tragedy was averted.</p>
      <p>"<i>In the end I was fine</i> ," Johann said<b><i>. "This accident could</i></b> <i><b>have been much worse</b></i>. <i>I knew it would be a long and hard race for me, but I managed to be fast with worn tires, so that I could keep up with the top ten and be able to fight with Espargarò."</i></p>
      <p>Too bad he slipped.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"It was really too bad. Unfortunately, that slip compromised my race, like happened to Petrucci. Fortunately, I wasn't injured, and that's the most important thing. It's a pity how it ended, even though this experience helped me understand the Honda more, and so many things in my life."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Racing aside, the biggest question is what his future will be.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"At the moment, the doors in the MotoGP are practically closed on every team," Zarco specified. "<b>At this point, I have nothing to lose, so I'll wait. </b>I've already lost a lot in the past, and I can't help but thank Lucio. These three races allowed me to clear several doubts, helping me understand that I'm a rider, despite the fact that people already knew that."</i>
      </p>
      <p>So Zarco tries to see the glass half full.</p>
      <p>"<b><i>It was like a rebirth, since I felt like a sick person before. All this is priceless for me. If I have to stop, I've still found the joy that was missing."</i></b></p>
      <p>Ducati took a step towards the French rider with the Avintia team, which could also benefit from a bit of help the official team.</p>
      <p>
        <i><b>"I don't want to make the same mistake I did a year ago,</b>"  Zarco pointed out. "You saw how sad I was when I couldn't be up front fighting with the best. <b>At this point, it's better if I return to the Moto2 for a good challenge."</b></i>
      </p>
      <p>The simplest track is the one that leads to Marc VDS.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I think Marc VDS would lose so much if Marquez left. <b>At the moment, Alex in Honda seems to be the most concrete hypothesis."</b></i>
