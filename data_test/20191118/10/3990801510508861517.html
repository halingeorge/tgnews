        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>I used to hate exercise. The thought of going into a gym surrounded by meatheads and working out until I was drenched in my own bodily fluids was… unappealing. Like, why bother doing that when I could just sit at home and watch TV?</p>
      <p>Then, at some point, that changed. These days I thoroughly enjoy going to the gym and find I feel awful if I don’t exercise a few times a week. But the hardest part of this change was the transition. It’s tough to start doing something that you don’t really <i>want </i>to do, and then keep on at it.</p>
      <p>There was a saving grace though: podcasts and music.</p>
      <p>I found that I was able to make going to the gym a constant habit because I looked forward to spending some time alone listening to podcasts and music. This meant I had a drive to get up and exercise.</p>
      <p>To achieve this though, you need two things: a music playing device (probably your phone), and some headphones that are suitable for exercise.</p>
      <p>And, would you believe it, there’s currently a great deal on an example of the latter. Yes, you can get <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8824894/type/dlg/fragment/v%3Dsoundsport_ie_headphones_ii_samsung_charcoal/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-in-ear-headphones-samsung-devices.html">50 percent off a pair of Bose SoundSport in-ear headphones</a>. That means <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8824894/type/dlg/fragment/v%3Dsoundsport_ie_headphones_ii_samsung_charcoal/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-in-ear-headphones-samsung-devices.html">these badgals are only $49</a>, which is pretty damn reasonable.</p>
      <p>Importantly, the Bose SoundSport are wired headphones, so if you have a brand new phone, expect to use a dongle. If you have a standard headphone jack? Then perfect.</p>
      <p>You get everything you’d expect from the Bose SoundSport in-ear headphones: sweat resistance, a carrying case, and that classic Bose sound quality.</p>
      <p>If you’ve been looking for a way to motivate yourself to exercise, then this could be your chance. Grab a pair of <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8824894/type/dlg/fragment/v%3Dsoundsport_ie_headphones_ii_samsung_charcoal/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-in-ear-headphones-samsung-devices.html">Bose SoundSport in-ear headphones for only $49</a> while stocks last. Your body will thank you.</p>
