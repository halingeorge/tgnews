      <h1>Why I Just Added Cisco And Energy Transfer To My Dividend Growth Portfolio</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:15:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Blue Chip DRiP</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>After the nearly 8% dive last week, Cisco is now slightly undervalued.</li>
        <li>Energy Transfer is lingering near their 52-week low, led by extremely negative market sentiment in the gas midstream arena.</li>
        <li>Last week, I added to both of these positions in my Blue Chip DRiP Portfolio. The purchases added approximately $199 of forward annual dividend income.</li>
        <li>I've included fair value estimates and my "common sense" (hopefully) reasoning for each buy.</li>
      </ul>

        <b>28,000 High and Climbing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wow! The Dow closed over 28,000 on Friday for a new all-time high. I can't complain about paper gains, but I'm definitely not puffing my chest out. On the contrary, I've been a bit gun shy with buying at such rich valuations. I'm cautiously stacking some cash in <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MINT">MINT</a> and 1-3 month CDs, for the inevitable correction or impending "R" word. But I manually reinvest and/or DRiP all of my dividends, and will continue to deploy fresh capital into companies I feel are undervalued and under-loved by the markets. All we can do is stay the course with a buy-and-hold mentality and a long-term compounding strategy. Small, incremental steps to success. Are you with me?</p>
      <p>With a quick search on Seeking Alpha, it's easy to find well-articulated and well-researched "deep dive" articles positing both bull and bear theses for Energy Transfer (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET">ET</a>) and Cisco Systems (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO">CSCO</a>) (or pretty much any stock for that matter). The aim of this article is to highlight my recent purchases and explain why they fit into my personal dividend growth investing strategy. I'll employ basic, time-tested methods to judge the strength and intrinsic value of the companies. I hope this can serve as a jumping-off point for your personal investing research. With that said, let's dig in!</p>

      <p>On November 14th, Cisco Systems tumbled almost 8%. This is due to surprisingly negative future guidance released with the earnings report. They are forecasting EPS at $0.75-$0.77 (consensus was $0.79) and a revenue drop of approximately 3-5% Y/Y. This came along with a fairly flat earnings statement highlighted by a slight EPS beat of $0.01 ($0.68) and revenue of $13.16B (beat by $70M or +0.7% Y/Y).</p>

      <p>Referencing my "cheatsheet" above, here are the main reasons I purchased CSCO last week:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>At $45, it's trading about 5% below my conservative fair value estimate of $48, and 22% below the 52-week high.</li>
        <li>The 3 and 5-year dividend growth rates are fantastic (16% and 20%). Even if that slows considerably, I'll still be happy with high single digits or low double-digit growth.</li>
        <li>The 45% payout ratio shows me that the dividend (which has been growing for 8 consecutive years) is well-covered.</li>
        <li>The current 3.10% dividend yield is higher than the 5-year average of 2.93%. The current P/E of 16 is also lower than the 5-year average of 17.</li>
        <li>They have their debt in check.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cisco is placing more emphasis on software and transitioning towards recurring, subscription-based streams of income. This, along with weakened demand for hardware are attributing to the near-term slowdown of the company. In the long term, I think their modernized business model will help them navigate a route to success. I'm comfortable adding to CSCO in the $45 range as part of my diversified Dividend Growth Portfolio.</p>

      <p>Falling knife or coiled spring? Don't we wish we knew the answer. However you slice it, Energy Transfer and the entire midstream gas industry is hated by the markets right now. Is the reasoning valid? Well, that's up to you to decide. Yes, there are obvious risks. There are obvious risks with Cisco too. I won't spell them out here. That's what the "deep dive" articles are for. The ones recently published from <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4301932-buying-energy-transfer-safe-9-percent-yield">Julian Lin</a> and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4306166-wall-street-dead-wrong-3-high-yield-stocks">Dividend Sensei</a> both have great takeaway. I feel the current price level mitigates much of the risk. The high potential of reward and margin of safety at my purchase price of $11.16 outweighs the chances of getting stabbed in the toe with a sharp switchblade. This purchase drives my cost basis down and increases the chance for long-term success. If I'm wrong? That's what bandages and diversification are for.</p>

      <p>Referencing my "cheatsheet" above, here are the main reasons I purchased Energy Transfer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's trading close to 30% below it's 52-week high and almost 40% below my conservative fair value estimate. Talk about margin of safety!!</li>
        <li>The 87% payout ratio is higher than I normally like, but they've been handling this for a while, and have continued to grow their dividend for 10 years straight (making them a Dividend Champion).</li>
        <li>The current P/E ratio of 9.47 is way below the 5-year average of 23.92.</li>
        <li>The current yield of 10.5% is way above the 6.5% 5-year average.</li>
        <li>The dividend growth rate has been slowing. The 3-year (not charted above) is 6.15% vs the 13.35% 5-year average growth. But with a yield of 10+% how much growth can you expect or need in the near term? If the unit price reverts to be more on par with its valuation and the yield normalizes, everyone will be happy.</li>

      <p>The markets continue to shatter all-time highs. In general, valuations are very high. To achieve financial emancipation, discipline and diversification remain paramount. Sometimes I visualize I'm a Budweiser Clydesdale with the huge blinders on. Drowning out the noise and all the chaos, laser-focused on the task at hand. The task of building a safe and reliable passive income stream by owning stakes in strong, dividend-paying businesses. Full speed ahead!</p>
