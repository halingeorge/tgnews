      <h1>Entire weekend schedule in Spain's top women's football league postponed after players strike</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:51:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/molly-mcelwee/" target="_blank">Molly McElwee</a></address>
      <p>All eight of Spain's top division women's football matches were postponed at the weekend as players went ahead with planned strike action following a wage dispute with the league's clubs. </p>
      <p>Two games on Saturday and six on Sunday, including Barcelona's tie at Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid's away fixture at Valencia, were affected as all league players barring one - Maddi Torre of Real Sociedad - refused to take to the field. It was as a result of failed negotiations over collective bargaining agreement for players, who are looking to increase their wages and improve their workers' rights.  </p>
      <p>A video supporting the strike, including Athletic Bilbao's Ainhoa Tirapu and fellow Spain international Silvia Meseguer of Atletico Madrid, was promoted on social media by the Association of Spanish Footballers at the weekend, and was viewed over a million times.</p>
      <p>"We are the same as you, we are workers," Tirapu said, speaking directly to camera. "It's the time, the time to make history."</p>
      <p>"This fight is for those that came before us, those currently playing and those who will one day be in our place," Jade Boho of EDF Logrono continued. </p>
      <p>"Today female footballers say 'enough'." Mariasun Quinones, Real Sociedad goalkeeper, said. </p>

      <p>Alongside injury, holiday and maternity leave, the main stipulation in negotiations is pay, with players asking for minimum wages of €16,000 for those employed full-time and that part-time contracts be increased to €12,000 at least. The clubs argue that €8,000 should be the limit on the latter request. </p>
      <p>13 months of failed talks prompted almost 200 players to vote in favour of boycotting their fixtures back in October, and in the intervening weeks before the November 16 planned start date, the clubs and union have been unable to agree on new minimum terms that will apply to all player contracts across the league. </p>
      <p>During that time Mediapro - who hold broadcast rights to 12 of the 16 Primera Iberdrola teams - offered to pay the €1.5million difference to meet players' requests and avoid the strike. However, the Spanish Football Federation intervened, as their offer of €1.15m to impede the strike would only stand if the league returned broadcast rights to them by the 2022-23 season.</p>
      <p>The strike is expected to continue indefinitely, until both the players and clubs are able to reach an agreement.</p>
