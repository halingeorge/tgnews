      <h1>Joe Biden says he would not legalise cannabis over fears it could be gateway drug</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:25:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zoe Tidman</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a> has said he would not legalise <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cannabis">cannabis</a> across the US because he feared it could be a gateway drug.</p>
      <p>The Democratic presidential candidate said he needed “a lot more” evidence on whether the substance caused further drug use.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug">The US National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> (NIDA) says most cannabis users do not go on to use harder substances.</p>
      <p>"There has not been nearly enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Mr Biden said during a town hall meeting in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>“It’s a debate. I want a lot more before I legalise it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25168081">some research</a> points to cannabis acting as a "gateway" to harder substances, other <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22049069">research has found</a> alcohol and nicotine may be more likely to lead to further drug use.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00952990.2015.1045977">One study</a> found that even though cannabis did often precede people taking other drugs, the reason why subjects used cannabis in the first place - such as "boredom" - was a larger risk factor than the cannabis itself.</p>
      <p>Mr Biden said he supported individual states deciding their own recreational cannabis laws.</p>
      <p>He said: “I don’t know enough to know whether it is [a gateway drug] or not, although I’ve done a great deal of work on the drugs side of the issue.”</p>
      <p>The former vice president under <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> was asked during the meeting whether his stance towards recreational cannabis has changed. He replied: “No, it has not.”</p>
      <p>Mr Biden has a long history of supporting anti-drug legislation and has been criticised for his role during the "war on drugs" of the 1990s.</p>
      <p>During that period, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/joe-biden-drug-policy-cocaine-crack-law-legislation-2020-president-election-bid-a8740271.html">he helped write a “tough on crime” bill</a> which led to harsh sentences for crack cocaine use and has been accused as disproportionately affecting black Americans.</p>
      <p>However, during his talk in Las Vegas, he said he did not believe people should be sent to prison for cannabis use and that any existing convictions should be expunged.</p>
      <p>He also said he supported medical use of the drug.</p>
      <p><a href="http://news.unm.edu/news/study-finds-legal-cannabis-may-reduce-use-of-dangerous-prescription-drugs">One study has claimed</a> cannabis may be the opposite of a gateway drug, as it could <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/study-marijuana-hard-drugs-prevent-gateway-study-addiction-jacob-miguel-vigil-new-mexico-a7960616.html">prevent people from becoming hooked on potentially dangerous prescription drugs</a>.</p>
