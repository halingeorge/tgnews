      <h1>Alabama star Tua Tagovailoa set for hip surgery in Houston</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:31:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama</a> quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is scheduled to have hip surgery in Houston.</p>
      <p>Team surgeon Dr. Lyle Cain said in a statement Sunday that Tagovailoa will have surgery on his dislocated right hip Monday. An Alabama spokesman declined to disclose where he was having the surgery citing privacy reasons.</p>
      <p>Cain says the medical team “consulted with multiple orthopedic experts across the country, who specialize in hip injuries and surgeries.” He reiterated that they expect Tagovailoa to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>The fifth-ranked Crimson Tide’s star, a potential top pick in April’s NFL draft, was injured while being dragged down by two defenders late in the first half of Saturday’s 38-7 win over Mississippi State.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa had been nursing an ankle injury and Alabama was considering holding him out of this game. Defensive linemen Phidarian Mathis and Raekwon Davis posted a picture with a smiling Tagovailoa in his hospital bed Sunday.</p>
      <p>He passed for 418 yards and four touchdowns in a loss to No. 1 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers">LSU</a> less than three weeks after right ankle surgery.</p>
