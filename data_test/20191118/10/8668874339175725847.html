      <p>Rugby <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> Chairman, Cameron Clyne has fallen on his sword, announcing that he will not stand for re-election at the completion of his current term in March 2020.</p>
      <p>Clyne has served as Chairman of the Rugby Australia Board since January 2016 in what has been an unprecedented period of turbulence for the union.</p>
      <p>The axing of the Western Force, his non-relationship with Michael Cheika, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/this-is-how-aussie-politicians-have-reacted-to-latest-reprehensible-folau-comments/">the </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/waratahs/players/israel-folau/">Israel Folau</a> saga and Australia’s quarter-final exit from the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> have marked out his era as one of unparalleled difficulty for the organisation.</p>
      <p>He will formally resign as Chairman at the 2020 Rugby Australia Annual General Meeting on 30 March 2020.</p>
      <p>“I have decided that I will not seek re-election when my term concludes at the Rugby Australia AGM in March next year,” said Clyne.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Notwithstanding the very painful decision to remove the Western Force from the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> competition and the mixed results of the Wallabies in recent years, there have been a number of achievements and positive advancements right across the game over the past four years.</p>
      <p>“Female participation in Rugby has tripled, we’ve seen enormous growth in Sevens participation on the back of the Gold medal success of our women’s team, and against global trends in participation we have achieved growth in traditional XV’s Rugby in several States and Territories.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, recently, much of the focus of the media has been directed at myself, which has overshadowed a lot of great work that has been done and continues to be done at the community level through to the national level by our volunteers, administrators, players, coaches, and match officials across the country.</p>

      <p>“It is hoped that with my resignation, the attention can return to where it rightfully should be, which is on the field and that this positive work will be highlighted.</p>
      <p>“Over the next four months I, along with the rest of the Board, remain committed to overseeing the delivery of a new broadcast deal, the appointment of a new Wallabies Head Coach, and the conclusion of the legal matter involving Israel Folau.</p>
      <p>“During this time, the Board will work with the Member Union Chairs and the Nominations Committee to find a suitable replacement for my position on the Board and I will aim to make a seamless transition from the role, with a replacement in place at the AGM.</p>

      <p>“Personally, it’s been an incredible privilege to have served as Chairman and to have been part of such a professional and devoted team on the Rugby Australia Board and I look forward to continuing to support the game after my time in the role concludes.”</p>
      <p>Queensland Rugby Union Chairman, Jeff Miller said: “On behalf of the QRU and the Member Unions I want to extend our sincere appreciation for Cameron’s efforts in leading the Rugby Australia Board over the past four years.</p>
      <p>“It has not been an easy ride with the game enduring some challenging circumstances during his time as Chair, but his commitment to the role and his want for the game to experience success at every level could never be questioned.</p>
      <p>“He is a passionate Rugby man and always put the interests of the game above anything else,” said Miller.</p>
