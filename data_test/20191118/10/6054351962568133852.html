      <p>Back when Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls were dominating the NBA throughout the 1990s, the six-time championship team used to drive fear into visiting opponent’s hearts when they entered the United Center as an ominous sample of The Alan Parsons Project’s “Sirius” blared through the sound system.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn’s own Fabolous is attempting to bring that feeling back with his new single, “B.O.M.B.S,” an acryonm for “back on my bullshit” and what he says is the first taste for his upcoming mixtape, <i>Summertime Shoutout 3</i>.</p>

      <p>“I’m that bull in the hood/New Lamb truck, got the bull in the hood/Black and red lookin’ like the Bulls at the hood<br/>23’s on it, got the Bulls sitting good,” he quips.</p>
      <p>According to the song’s outro, the aforementioned project will be released in 2020 when it gets warm.</p>
