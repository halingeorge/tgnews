      <h1>Ray Parlour makes prediction about Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen</h1>

      <p>talkSPORT presenter Ray Parlour believes Christian Eriksen may try to block an exit in January.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal midfielder reckons he knows it would benefit himself financially to see out his contract, with his next club able to put more towards his wages as they’d save on a transfer fee.</p>

      <p>The playmaker appears highly unlikely to agree a new deal with the club, and it is widely accepted he will be moving on.</p>
      <p>Eriksen’s form has plunged this term and fans have often accused him of not wanting to be at the club amid his contract situation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://talksport.com/football/631066/tottenham-sell-christian-eriksen-january-ray-parlour-spurs-free/">Parlour said</a>: “I think the player will have something to say about [leaving in January], because he might say, ‘I’m not going anywhere’.</p>

      <p>“From January 1 you can do your contract and pre-sign with whoever you are going to, and his wages will be so much more if he goes on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>“So he’ll be saying: ‘No, I’m not going anywhere and I don’t have to go anywhere’.</p>
      <p>“You might get £20 million for him in January, but that £20 million will go in <i>his</i> pocket if he stays another six months.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Tottenham will struggle to offload in January</h3>
      <p>Spurs will do extremely well to get rid of Eriksen in January.</p>

      <p>At this point, it surely makes more sense for other teams to try and save money by signing him for the summer, perhaps on a pre-contract agreement.</p>
      <p>At the moment, teams are unlikely to want to pay to have a player who is in such poor form.</p>
      <p>And certainly if £75,000-a-week Eriksen (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/tottenham-hotspur-f.c/payroll/">Spotrac</a>) digs his heels in then there is very little chance of Tottenham shifting him for even a small fee.</p>
