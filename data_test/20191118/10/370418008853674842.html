      <p>With a grand total of five reunion gigs confirmed so far, it would seem as though <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/my-chemical-romance/">My Chemical Romance</a> are now back in rehearsals together, having just shared their first group photo since they announced their comeback.</p>
      <p>In fact, while the new pic comes ahead of their sold-out Los Angeles show next month, it actually marks the first photo we’ve seen of <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/gerard-way/">Gerard</a> and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/mikey-way/">Mikey Way</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/frank-iero/">Frank Iero</a> and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/ray-toro/">Ray Toro</a> all together since May 2017, when the guys attended Frank’s show with The Patience at The Troubadour. Damn, we can’t <i>wait</i> to find out what songs they’ve been practicing.</p>
      <p>Despite the lack of new promo or official shots from the band, this heartwarming candid photo is more than enough to keep everyone going for now…</p>

      <p>In the days following My Chem’s highly-anticipated return, the band themselves revealed that they weren’t expecting such an incredible response from the rock world.</p>
      <p>“It is truly unbelievable to us the happiness we have experienced over the past two days,” the band said in a statement. “From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for the warm welcome back. We truly did not expect this. See you soon. Xoxo, MCR.”</p>
      <p>Fingers crossed we’ll hear of even more announcements very soon.</p>
