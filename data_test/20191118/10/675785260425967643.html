      <h1>Eden Hazard's work-rate criticised by former Chelsea teammate John Obi Mikel</h1>
      <h2>Eden Hazard was Chelsea's leading light for much of his time at Stamford Bridge but has had his work rate criticised</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:54:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:54</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Eden Hazard has been labelled as the "laziest player I have played alongside" by former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> team-mate John Obi-Mikel.</p>
      <p>The Belgian played alongside the defensive midfielder for five-years at Stamford Bridge, but has been criticised for his lethargic attitude in training.</p>
      <p>Mikel though does maintain that Hazard has "an incredible talent" having won the Premier League title together in 2015.</p>
      <p>"The laziest player I have played alongside is Eden Hazard," Mikel told beIN Sports in Turkey.</p>
      <p>"Hazard has an incredible talent, maybe not as good as [Lionel] Messi, but he can do whatever he wants with the ball at his feet.</p>
      <p>"He didn't like to train hard. While we were working he was waiting for us to finish training just standing there. But on Sundays he was always man of the match, it was unbelievable."</p>

      <p>Hazard's efforts last year, almost singlehandedly at times, helped Chelsea finish third and win the Europa League under Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>But with his contract winding down he made it known that he wanted his dream move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and the Blues obliged.</p>

      <p>Hazard, as well as Los Blancos, have struggled to impose themselves this season despite some heavy spending overseen by Zinedine Zidane.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old was expected to leave a huge hole in the Chelsea squad, especially as their transfer ban prohibited them from adding a replacement.</p>
      <p>But under Frank Lampard a side filled with academy-produced talent has soared into the top four playing some excellent stuff.</p>
      <p>Mikel also played alongside the now Chelsea boss while in west London and, in contrast to Hazard, has labelled Lampard as the hardest working player he ever came across.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have won their last six in the Premier League ahead of a trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> when they return to action and can still qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p>
