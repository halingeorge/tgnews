      <h1>Official Nokia Security+OS update tracker updated (November 18) with October/November Security update details for all devices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:47:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Nayan</a></address>
      <p>The official Security+OS update tracker page for Nokia smartphones has been updated on November 18 by HMD with details about the availability of October &amp; November Security updates for all Nokia smartphones. As you may be already aware the page lists Build number and details like whether it is just a security patch or firmware update + security patch for a particular device.</p>
      <p>As per the latest updated information provided on the page, currently, November Security update is available for only Nokia 3 and Nokia 6.2. This is suprising given <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/nokia-9-pureview-nokia-3-1-plus-receiving-november-security-update-2019-now-in-many-markets/">Nokia 9 PureView and Nokia 3.1 Plus</a> recently received the update. All other Nokia smartphones including Nokia 8.1, 7.2 and others haven’t yet received the November security update in any market as per the updated tracker information.</p>

      <p>In case the security update is not yet available for your Nokia smartphone, you should check the build number of your smartphone and confirm it with the information provided on the page. If the build number for a particular device is mentioned in the list then only it gets the update.</p>
