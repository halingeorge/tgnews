      <h1>Dead Island 2 is Still Happening</h1>

      <p>It looks like <i>Dead Island</i> might not be dead after all. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-14-how-koch-media-is-ensuring-classic-brand-comebacks-are-worth-the-wait">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Koch Media CEO Klemens Kundratitz said that despite a troubled development history, a sequel to the tropical zombie game is still in the works.</p>
      <p>Kundratitz said that “Dead Island is a very important brand for us and we’ve got to get it right,” suggesting that the already eight-year gap between games is “just a testimony of our dedication to get it right.”</p>
      <p>“It’s a great story to tell everyone that it's on its third studio, but we like to be judged on the end result and we’re really confident that when it comes out it’s going to be a kick-ass zombie game. We’ll certainly give it all our power.”</p>
      <p>The original <i>Dead Island</i> was developed by Techland, who began work on a sequel before moving on to <i>Dying Light</i> instead. The IP then passed to <i>Spec Ops: The Line</i> developer Yager, then Sumo Digital. Eventually, it came to rest with Dambuster Studios, whose heritage stretches back to <i>Timesplitters</i> and the <i>Crysis</i> trilogy. Eight years after<i> Dead Island</i>’s original release, however, there’s still no word on when a sequel will see the light of day.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kundratitz had some more concrete news for fans of a different series, confirming that Volition is working on a new Saints Row game. Further details are non-existent, but more information should be forthcoming next year.</p>
