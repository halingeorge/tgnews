      <p><b>New Delhi</b>: All may not be going to the Shiv Sena’s expectation to form the Maharashtra government after breaking ties with long-time ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
      <p>Having knocked on Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s doors, the Shiv Sena was hoping for a three-party tie-up between the Sena, Congress and pre-poll ally the NCP.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Gandhi and NCP chief Sharad Pawar were examining the efficacy of this ideologically-mismatched alliance for the last several days but it seems this may not materialise after all.</p>
      <p>Pawar made a cryptic statement on Monday. He said: “BJP-Shiv Sena fought together, we (NCP) and Congress fought together. They have to choose their path and we will do our politics.”</p>
      <p>Does this mean the end of the negotiations for these three?</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena and the BJP, who had fought the polls together, could not form the government due to differences over power-sharing, particularly the chief minister’s post.</p>
      <p>Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also pulled out his party’s lone minister in the Union Cabinet to signal to the Congress, NCP that he was ready for an alliance.</p>
      <p>While Pawar has ruled out fresh elections, stating Maharashtra would soon see a stable government, his colleague Nawab Malik recently said the Sena would get the chief minister’s post.</p>
      <p>The three parties had even prepared a draft common minimum programme to be taken by the top leaderships before an alliance call could be taken.</p>
      <p>The BJP emerged as the single-largest party in the state with 105 seats in the 288-member assembly followed by Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44.</p>
