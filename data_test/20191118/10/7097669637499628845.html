      <p>Tbilisi (AFP) - The United States and European Union expressed solidarity Monday with Georgia's anti-government protesters who took to the streets after the ruling party backtracked on promises of electoral reforms.</p>
      <p>In the biggest anti-government protest in years, more than 20,000 demonstrators rallied on Sunday outside the parliament building in the capital Tbilisi urging the government to resign and calling for new legislative elections.</p>
      <p>But the ruling Georgian Dream party general secretary and Tbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze flatly ruled out the possibility of early polls on Monday.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a news conference, he accused the opposition of "destabilising political processes with cheap and destructive performances."</p>
      <p>In a joint statement earlier Monday, the US and EU embassies said they "recognise the deep disappointment of a wide segment of Georgian society at the failure of parliament to pass the constitutional amendments required to move to fully proportional parliamentary elections in 2020."</p>
      <p>"We fully support the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression," they said.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night, the rally dispersed peacefully but entrances to the parliament building remained blocked by dozens of protesters who say no lawmakers will be allowed to pass through.</p>
      <p>On Monday morning, Georgian Dream MPs were not allowed into the building by a crowd of protesters who shouted "Rats!" and "Slaves!" and denounced Georgia's richest man and party leader Bidzina Ivanishvili.</p>
      <p>As of Monday afternoon, traffic remained blocked by protesters on Tbilisi's main thoroughfare, Rustaveli Avenue, and several other streets.</p>
      <p>At a protest on Thursday, some 10,000 people rallied in Tbilisi, vowing to press ahead with "permanent" protests until their demands for snap polls are met.</p>
      <p>- Plummeting popularity -</p>
      <p>Opposition parties called for the rallies after forming a rare united front against the ruling party, whose MPs last week voted down legislation to hold parliamentary elections next year under a new proportional voting system.</p>
      <p>The opposition accused oligarch Ivanishvili –- who is widely believed to be the man in charge in Georgia -- of being behind the move.</p>
      <p>Twelve ruling party lawmakers –- including two deputy parliament speakers –- have left Georgian Dream to protest the controversial vote.</p>
      <p>The US and EU embassies said the failure to pass the legislation "has increased mistrust and heightened tensions between the ruling party and other political parties and civil society."</p>
      <p>Protesters say the ruling party unfairly benefits from the current voting system.</p>
      <p>The Georgian Dream party won nearly 77 percent of seats in the 2016 parliamentary election despite garnering only 48.7 percent of the vote.</p>
      <p>The opposition at the time denounced the polls as rigged.</p>
      <p>Ivanishvili announced "large-scale political reform" following a summer of protests that saw 240 people injured in a police crackdown.</p>
      <p>Two peaceful protesters including a teenaged girl lost an eye at the time.</p>
      <p>In power since 2012, the ruling party has seen its popularity plummet amid widespread discontent over economic stagnation and perceived backsliding on its commitment to democracy.</p>
      <p>Critics accuse Ivanishvili of persecuting political opponents, suffocating critical media, and creating a corrupt political system where his private interests dominate government decision-making.</p>
