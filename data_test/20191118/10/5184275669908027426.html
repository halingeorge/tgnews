      <p>Amongst the very first from Bollywood who rushed to Manish was Shabana Azmi and Sophie Chaudhary. There were several pictures of stars viral over the internet.

      <p>Manish Malhotra’s nephew director Puneet Malhotra was also spotted. In the pictures, Puneet can be seen performing the last rituals of his late grandfather. Puneet made his directorial debut with Karan Johar produced <i>Student of The Year 2</i>.</p>
      <p>Manish has been a prominent name in Bollywood for almost two decades now. The designer who made his entry in 1990s has reached peaks of success. Recently, he made his debut on stage where he designed clothes for the Feroz Abbas Khan’s adaptation of K. Asif’s yesteryear classic Mughal-e-Azam in 2016.</p>
      <p>We offer our deepest condolences to Manish Malhotra and his family.</p>
