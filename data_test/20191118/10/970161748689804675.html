      <h1>Second Boris Johnson affair investigated as part of misconduct probe</h1>

      <p>An investigation into <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>’s relationship with a US businesswoman will also look into another affair he failed to declare during his time as London mayor, with a woman who had his child.</p>
      <p>The prime minister is accused of misconduct in public office over alleged favours made to entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri while he was at City Hall.</p>
      <p>During this period, Ms Arcuri received £11,500 in sponsorship from the mayor’s promotional agency, London &amp; Partners, and access to trade missions to Tel Aviv and New York, after intervention from the mayor’s office.</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri said she won the funds and access on merit.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has insisted there was no interest to declare and that he acted with ‘full propriety’.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri-investigation-to-review-affair-with-another-woman">the Guardian</a>, the London Assembly’s oversight committee is investigating Mr Johnson’s links to and Ms Arcuri after she made fresh claims about their relationship in an ITV documentary shown last night.</p>

      <p>The Assembly committee said a previous affair for which Mr Johnson avoided censure for in 2010 would make up part of its probe.</p>

      <p>It said the prime minister failed to declare interest over his affair with unpaid City Hall adviser Helen Macintyre, who it later emerged gave birth to one of his children.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Mr Johnson acknowledged the potential conflict of interest had not been disclosed and vowed to ‘bear in mind the definition of close associate for the future’.</p>
      <p>Len Duvall, a Labour assembly member who chairs the committee, told the Guardian: ‘I’m looking at the paperwork into Helen Macintyre.</p>
      <p>‘We need to understand that because he was advised to make those declarations in the future.</p>
      <p>‘The question is why did he hide the new relationship with Arcuri?’</p>
      <p>This morning Ms Arcuri once again<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/jennifer-arcuri-says-special-relationship-boris-johnson-11173714/"> refused to declare whether or not she had an affair</a> with the prime minister.</p>
      <p>The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) is currently deciding whether there is enough evidence to mount a criminal investigation against Mr Johnson into allegations of misconduct in public office over the alleged favours to Ms Arcuri.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Mr Duvall’s investigation is on hold until the IOPC makes its decision.</p>
      <p>That is not likely to be until after the general election in December.</p>
