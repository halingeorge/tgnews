      <h1>Stats show well-drilled Liverpool play the best offside trap in the Premier League</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:17:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have been well-drilled by Jurgen Klopp over the last couple of seasons, and with a couple of incredible additions at the back, have become the best defensive unit in the country.</p>
      <p>While Manchester City struggle with an uncomfortable partnership of John Stones and Fernandinho and Manchester United splashed well over the odds for Harry Maguire, the Reds have a settled backline and know exactly how best to play.</p>
      <p>With Virgil van Dijk orchestrating and Alisson able to sweep up any balls over the top, the Reds have been able to play a high line consistently, and even with VAR often delaying offside calls, the Reds are comfortably the best at playing the offside trap of any side in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>As these graphs and stats below courtesy of @LuizFSantoss on Twitter show, the Reds are leading the way when it comes to that particular defensive action, with seven more than the next best side, West Ham United.</p>
      <blockquote>Going away from totals, Liverpool is the only Premier League club so far to average over 4 SOffT per game. Most teams average between 1 and 2. <a href="https://t.co/jZJ1WDnJGd">pic.twitter.com/jZJ1WDnJGd<br/></a>— brazilian naby keita (@LuizFSantoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/LuizFSantoss/status/1196034997523755008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Van Dijk and co have also conceded the third-fewest number of goals in the Premier League so far this year (10), behind only Leicester City (eight) and Sheffield United (nine).</p>
      <p>As well as Adrian did while Alisson was out injured, the statistics are likely to only improve further with the Brazilian between the sticks. The early pattern, though, is a very good starting point from which to jump off.</p>
