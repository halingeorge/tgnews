      <h1>Who could Ireland play in the Euro 2020 play-offs? Potential opponents and permutations for Mick McCarthy's side</h1>
      <h2>All is not lost as Mick McCarthy's side didn't pick up three points against Denmark in the Aviva</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:40:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:40</time> by <a rel="author">Eamon Doggett, Gavin Quinn</a></address>
      <p>All is not lost Ireland tonight after failing to beat Denmark as they can still make the Euro 2020 championships via the play-offs.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's men played out of their skin at the Aviva Stadium, but couldn't find a winner after Matt Doherty leveled affairs with four minutes left on the clock.</p>
      <p>But they'll have another bite of the cherry next year, with play-offs to decide the final four teams that will head to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Here is all you need to about the Euro 2020 play-offs:</p>
      <h3>Who could Ireland play in the play-offs?</h3>
      <p>Ireland could play Bosnia, Wales, Slovakia and Northern Ireland depending on the result of Wales' match with Hungary.</p>
      <p>They will go into a one-legged semi-final before a final three days later.</p>
      <h3>What are the permutations for who we get in the play-offs?</h3>

      <p>Ireland know they can't play Northern Ireland in a semi-final as they are the lowest-ranked contenders. But Mick McCarthy's team could face Michael O'Neill's outfit in a final.</p>
      <p>Fail to beat Denmark though and our semi-final opponents will be contingent on Wales' clash with Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday (7.45pm kick-off).</p>
      <p><b>If Wales beat Hungary</b>, Ireland will travel Slovakia for a semi-final, leaving Northern Ireland to go to Bosnia.</p>
      <p><b>If Wales draw with Hungary and Slovakia beat Azerbaijan</b>, then Ireland will have to go to Cardiff to takes on Wales, while Bosnia will still host Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p><b>If Wales lose to Hungary</b>, it gets a bit complicated...</p>
      <p>Ireland will stay in the League B play-off draw but one of Wales, Slovakia and Northern Ireland will be moved to a Leaguer A play-off draw (to be decided by a draw).</p>
      <p>In this scenario, if Wales get moved to League A, Ireland will play Slovakia in a semi-final, with Bosnia taking on Northern Ireland in the other semi-final.</p>
      <p>If Slovakia are moved to League A, Ireland will play Wales in Cardiff in a semi-final, with Bosnia taking on Northern Ireland in the other semi-final.</p>
      <p>If Northern Ireland are moved to League A, Ireland will travel to Bosnia, with Wales will taking on Slovakia in the other semi-final.</p>
      <h3>When will the play-off semi-finals take place?</h3>

      <p>The semi-finals of the paths take place on March 26th with the highest ranked team in each tie playing at home.</p>
      <p>The finals take place on March 31st with the hosts decided by a draw. The semi-finals and finals are both single leg ties.</p>
      <h3>When is the Euro 2020 draw?</h3>
      <p>The draw for the tournament will take place on Saturday 30 November.</p>
      <p>It is set to start in Bucharest at 5pm (Irish time).</p>
      <h3>How does the draw work?</h3>
      <p>Each team will be put into a designed pot. There are four pots altogether with six teams in each pot. The pots are ranked 1-4 with the highest seeded teams in pot 1, the next highest in pot 2 and so on...</p>
      <p>However, as there are 12 host nations, each nation that qualifies (or could qualify via the play-offs) is placed in one of the following groups so that they are guaranteed to be at home in at least two group games:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Group A: Italy, Azerbaijan</li>
        <li>Group B: Russia, Denmark</li>
        <li>Group C: Netherlands, Romania</li>
        <li>Group D: England, Scotland</li>
        <li>Group E: Spain, Republic of Ireland</li>
        <li>Group F: Germany, Hungary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If both teams from each of these groups qualify, another draw will be held to determine which team plays at home.</p>
      <p>In short, if Ireland qualify for Euro 2020, we know already that we will be guaranteed to be in Group E with Spain.</p>
      <p>When will the group stage take place?</p>
      <p>The group stage matches will take place between 12-24 June.</p>
      <h3>Where could Ireland play their matches?</h3>
      <p>If Ireland qualify for Euro 2020 via the playoffs, they will play two group matches at the Aviva in Dublin and will take on Spain in Bilbao.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If Ireland win Group E they will play...</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Last 16: Glasgow</li>
        <li>QF: Rome</li>
        <li>SF: Wembley</li>
        <li>Final: Wembley</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>If Ireland come second in Group E the will play...</b>
