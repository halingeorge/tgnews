      <p>MELAKA, Nov 18 — The Melaka state government today tabled the 2020 budget of RM390 million, with an excess of RM220,000, to record a surplus budget for the 16th consecutive year.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister Adly Zahari, when tabling the budget said it was an increase of 2.03 per cent from this year’s budget of RM382.23 million.</p>
      <p>However, he said it was a minimal increase taking into account the cost-cutting measures adopted and the existing commitment.</p>
      <p>“Out of the total allocation, RM9.17 million was for liabilities and RM380.83 million for supplies,” he said at the state assembly sitting at Kompleks Seri Negeri, Ayer Keroh here today.</p>
      <p>Adly said of the total operating expenditure, RM378.42 would be for the existing policies, RM3.32 million was for new policies and RM8.26 million would go towards the one-off items.</p>
      <p>He said RM70 million had also been allocated for development expenditure out of which RM48.74 million was from state-generated revenue while RM21.26 million was from the Federal Government grants.</p>
      <p>“From RM380.83 million for supplies, RM168.24 or 44.18 per cent has been allocated for services and supplies, emoluments (RM107.96 million/28.35 per cent); dividends and fixed payments (RM99.65 million/26.17 per cent); asset procurement (RM4.39 million/1.15 per cent) and the remaining is for miscellaneous expenditure,” he said.</p>
      <p>Adly said the state government revenue was estimated to increase to RM390.22 million or 1.54 per cent higher than this year’s budget.</p>
      <p>“The state government is expected to collect revenue of RM154.65 from tax revenue; non-tax revenue (RM181.55 million); non-revenue receipts (RM54.02 million),” he said. — Bernama</p>
