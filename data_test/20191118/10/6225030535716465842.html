      <p>A stellar international lineup will contest the LONGINES International Jockeys’ Championship at Happy Valley Racecourse Nov. 4.<br/>Among the all-star cast is Frankie Dettori -- riding in off perhaps the best season of his long and storied career -- who is set to take his place in the IJC for the first time since he lifted the trophy back in 2011. The three-time competition winner will aim to cap a sensational year in glittering style at the iconic city venue: the Italian has won 19 Group 1 races already this season, including three atop Europe’s exceptional race mare Enable.<br/>The HK$800,000 IJC is a four-race competition for 12 elite jockeys: eight overseas riders and four based in Hong Kong.<br/>The exciting overseas lineup includes another all-time great, Ryan Moore, as well as last year’s IJC victor and former British champion Silvestre de Sousa. Joining the contest for the first time is the newly-crowned British champion Oisin Murphy, one of world racing’s most rapidly ascending stars.</p>
      <p>New Zealand’s finest export, James McDonald, will represent Australia after achieving a third Sydney Premiership last term; the prolific Pierre-Charles Boudot will represent France; Ireland’s youthful past champion Colin Keane is set to return after a fine debut last year; and Japan’s World All-Star Jockeys champion Yuga Kawada is booked to make his LONGINES IJC debut. <br/>Hong Kong legends Joao Moreira and Zac Purton will add further luster to the gilded cast list. Each is a three-time champion in the world’s most intensely competitive circuit and both will be chasing a second LONGINES IJC victory.<br/>The third Hong Kong spot will go to Karis Teetan, who sits a clear third in the Hong Kong Premiership at present. The remaining berth will be decided after the Happy Valley race meeting on 20 November.<br/>Vincent Ho (11 wins) and Derek Leung (six) are battling for the berth allotted to Hong Kong’s leading homegrown rider (graduates of the world-renowned Hong Kong Jockey Club Apprentice Jockeys’ School).<br/>“This year’s LONGINES International Jockeys’ Championship has all the factors in place to be a classic edition," said Andrew Harding, the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s Executive Director. "We have a fantastic lineup of gifted riders, champions of great merit and huge appeal, and Frankie Dettori’s return to the Valley off an incredible year of achievement with rare champions like Enable and Stradivarius adds even greater excitement to what is always a thrilling contest.<br/>“The Hong Kong Jockey Club has succeeded again in putting together an outstanding cast of riders and we are looking forward to a great night of sport at what is not only the richest jockey challenge in the world but also the most spectacular.”<br/>The LONGINES IJC is a four-race competition in which points will be awarded as follows in each race: 12 points for 1st, 6 points for 2nd and 4 points for 3rd. The ranking of each jockey will be determined by the total number of points earned over all four races and the IJC champion will be the jockey with the highest accumulated points.<br/><b>Invited jockeys for 2019 LONGINES IJC</b></p>
