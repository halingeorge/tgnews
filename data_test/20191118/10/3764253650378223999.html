      <p>Billionaire <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1190566-bill-gates-house-cars.html">Bill Gates</a> has officially surpassed Amazon Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jeff Bezos as world's richest person on earth with a net worth of $110 billion (N39,765,000,000,000).</p>
      <p>The Amazon founder ended Gates' 24-year run as the richest man in 2018 with a net worth of $160 billion (N57,840,000,000,000).</p>
      <p>However, the Microsoft co-founder regained the lead on Friday, November 15, after Microsoft stock went up nearly 48% in 2019, helping boost the value of his stake in the tech giant, CNN reports.</p>

      <p>The rest of his wealth is derived from share sales and investments made over the years by his family office, Cascade.</p>
      <p>Gates had briefly topped Bezos as the world's richest man in October 2019, after Amazon's lacklustre Q3 results resulted in Bezos losing nearly $7 billion (N2,530,500,000,000) in stock value.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that the owner of Microsoft and world-known philanthropist recognised the feat <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1262691-bill-gates-honours-nigerian-medical-doctor-elvis-eze-excellent-passion-expertise.html">of a Nigerian, Elvis Eze, in the fight against malaria</a>.</p>
      <p>The tech giant said that the story of Eze is inspiring because he was once a victim of the scourge. He never allowed that to discourage him. He is a youth ambassador for Malaria No More UK, an organisation that is in charge of looking for fund and support to combat malaria.</p>
