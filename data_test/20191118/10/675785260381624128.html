      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/euston-station">Euston Station</a> was evacuated during rush hour after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fire">smoke</a> was seen coming from a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/london-underground">London Underground</a> train.</p>
      <p>Rush-hour commuters took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> fearing a Northern Line train had caught fire at the hub.</p>
      <p>They said they "could smell smoke" and "think there was a fire".</p>
      <p>One person tweeted: "Smoke coming from train on Northern Line platform at Euston. Station evacuated, avoid!"</p>
      <p>Another said: "Had a wild Monday morning today. #northernline train smelt increasingly of smoke, until we were told to get off it at #euston station. Rolls of smoke rolling of it, told to get back and then evacuated the whole station as the Firemen arrived."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/transport-for-london">Transport for London</a> confirmed the station was closed while authorities dealt with a "fire alert."</p>
      <p>And a spokeswoman from London Fire Brigade said they had three fire engines at the scene.</p>

      <p>She told Mirror Online: "We we called at 9.11am to reports of smoke issuing. Crews are investigating."</p>
      <p>A tweet later added: "We have finished our investigations at Euston underground station. There was slight smoke coming from underneath a train but no fire was identified. Crews will be leaving the scene shortly."</p>
      <p>It led to delays and suspensions on the Underground network.</p>
      <p>There was no service between Camden Town and Kennington via Bank southbound for some time.</p>
      <p>But it is unclear if the alert had caused delays to National Rail services.</p>

      <p>"Euston Station: Closed while we respond to a fire alert," reads a tweet on the official Northern Line account. </p>
      <p>Videos on social media show scores of people heading for exits amid the evacuation.</p>
      <p>Commuters said TfL staff told them to get off the train immediately at around 9.05am.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the British Transport Police (BTP) said they were responding alongside the London Fire Brigade.</p>

      <p>"It looks like part of a fire alert."</p>
      <p>National Rail uses the 16 platforms at the station for services in and out the capital.</p>
      <p>Euston Station in central London is the sixth-busiest station in Britain.</p>
      <p>It handles more than 70 million passengers each year.</p>
