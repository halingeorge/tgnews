      <h1>Verstappen wins crazy Brazilian GP</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:32:06+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>SAO PAULO: </b>Max Verstappen underlined his potential as a champion of the future on Sunday with a commanding victory for Red Bull in an astonishing and crash-hit Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old Dutchman twice passed newly-crowned six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton in a thrilling contest that had two safety car interventions and saw the Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc clash and retire, before clinching the eighth victory of his career.</p>
      <p>His third win this season also made up for his disappointment in last year’s race in Brazil when he looked certain to win before a late accident wrecked his hopes of victory.</p>
      <p>He made the most of pole position and finished a dominant winner ahead of his former Red Bull team-mate Pierre Gasly, now with Toro Rosso, as they delivered a Honda-powered one-two for the Japanese company for the first time since the heyday of local hero Ayrton Senna.</p>
      <p>Frenchman Gasly came home 0.062 seconds ahead of Hamilton, who finished third for Mercedes but was demoted to seventh following a post-race stewards’ investigation after crashing with luckless Thai driver Alexander Albon, the man who replaced Gasly at Red Bull, in the final laps.</p>
      <p>Hamilton’s demotion gifted McLaren’s Carlos Sainz his first Formula One podium, subject to several other stewards’ inquiries.</p>
      <p>“Lewis was very quick,” said Verstappen. “So I had to keep pushing all the time. He pitted early so we had to be on top of our pit-stops and we had a good move on him. I could control the race with the tyres I had, so, for me, it was unbelievable. It was a lot of fun out there and great to win the race.”</p>
      <p>He said his decisive second overtake of Hamilton was achieved thanks to his superior speed in the rarefied atmosphere of the 700-metre altitude Interlagos circuit.</p>
      <p>“I was behind so I was pushing flat out on my out lap,” he said. “We knew we had great top speed the whole weekend — but that was a guess — and I’m very happy to have got past him!”</p>
      <p>Gasly screamed with delight at his good fortune on his slow-down lap.</p>
