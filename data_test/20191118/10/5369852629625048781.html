      <p>AS POST-MATCH INTERVIEWS go, this was a pretty memorable one.</p>

      <p>Down kingpins Kilcoo booked their Ulster club championship final spot yesterday aftter a 1-8 to 0-9 victory over Derrygonnelly of Fermanagh.</p>
      <p>Aaron Branagan — one of five brothers on the starting team — scored the crucial second-half goal for Kilcoo and was named AIB Man of the Match after a powerful performance from centre-half back.</p>
      <p>While he stole the headlines from the match, he definitely added a few more afterwards in a brilliant interview with RTÉ Sport’s Evanne Ní Chuilinn.</p>
      <p>“We tend to leave it late to push it out in games. We know how to dog out games and thankfully we got through it,” he began.</p>
      <p>“It was a brilliant game, very tough. It was well refereed, I thought, very well refereed. That’s the way we like it, nice and tough. We’ll be looking forward to the next game. We know what we have to do.”</p>
      <p>Fairly run of the mill, as the focus now switches to Donegal champions Naomh Conaill.</p>

      <p>“Me scoring goals, that’s a small miracle!” he laughed then on his all-important individual contribution. “You know yourself, goals win games; thankfully it helped us push on over line.”</p>
      <p>But it was when Branagan was asked what it means to Kilcoo to be into an Ulster final that he delivered the golden line. </p>
      <blockquote>Ah, it’s absolutely everything. I was actually talking to a boy this morning, he said, ‘Well, there’s nothing else to do in Kilcoo but play football. You go to Mass and you have a few sheep, that’s really it.’</blockquote>
      <p>“Football is absolutely everything. To get here again is absolutely brilliant.”</p>
      <p>So with football meaning that much, and four of his brothers on the team alongside him — Niall, Aidan, Darryl and Eugene — they must talk about it a hell of a lot.</p>
      <p>“To be honest we talk more about sheep! Football gets a wee bit of talk as well. Yeah, listen, it’s nice to play with your brothers. It’s brilliant.</p>
      <blockquote>Then when somebody’s man scores you blame somebody else. There’s a bit of arguing going home but that’s part and parcel of it.</blockquote>

      <p>Branagan also paid tribute to veteran manager Mickey Moran, who arrived to Kilcoo this year after huge success with Derry’s Slaughtneil.</p>
      <p>“Mickey’s something else,” he said of Moran, who has also managed five county senior sides. “I always say he’s like the granddad I never had.</p>
      <p>“He’s the best. Anything he says, everybody’s attentive. He knows what to do to get us over the line and he calms us down. He’s calm, cool and collected.</p>
