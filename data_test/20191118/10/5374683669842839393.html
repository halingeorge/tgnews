      <h2>Angioplasty and medications prevent heart attacks in at-risk patients at approximately the same rates, largescale clinical trial finds.</h2>

      <p>A federally-funded study of 5,179 participants in 37 countries showed that heart attack patients may not need surgery after all.</p>
      <p>The study, called Ischemia, examined the use of traditional preventive measures in patients with heart disease who are at serious risk of heart attack.</p>
      <p>Ischemia was conducted by researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine and New York Universityâ€™s medical school.Presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting, the $100-million study will soon appear in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
      <p>The participants took a stress test and received lifestyle advice and medicines to improve heart health. Half of them also underwent a CT scan and then continued to take medications. The other half were taken to cardiac catheterization labs for angiograms. Three-fourths of these patients underwent angioplasty, while the rest underwent bypass surgery.</p>
      <p>After one year, 7% of those who underwent surgery had had a heart event, compared to 5% of those who were treated only with medications. After four years, however, 13% of those who had underwent surgery had had a heart event, compared to 15% of those treated only with medications.</p>
      <p>On average, during the seven-year study, no statistically significant differences between the groups were noticed over the course of the study.</p>
      <p>However, despite the similarity in prognosis, those who had underwent an invasive procedure said they suffered less chest pain than those who relied solely on medications.</p>
