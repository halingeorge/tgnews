      <p>Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday said his party must lead the Opposition in Parliament to expose the "utter mismanagement" of the economy by the Modi government.</p>
      <p>He also alleged that the government refuses to accept valid criticism.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, posted by his family on his behalf, Chidambaram said, "When Parliament opens today, Congress must lead the Opposition to expose the utter mismanagement of the economy."</p>
      <p>"Which aspect of the economy is doing well? Not one," he said.</p>
