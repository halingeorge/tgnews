      <h1>Seeds of hope sown at Greenwood edible garden</h1>

      <p>COMMUNITY groups have teamed up to create an edible garden to produce free meals for northern suburbs families.</p>
      <p>UnitingCare West’s Men of Hope group will use their regular cooking classes to grow and harvest produce on a donated patch of land at Uniting Church Trinity North in Greenwood.</p>
      <p>The mental health support group members will turn the produce into meals that will be donated to community members through the church’s Parish Pantry program.</p>
      <p>Quinns Men’s Shed donated six raised garden beds for the project, while Bunnings in Clarkson and The Salvation Army provided seedlings, soil, compost and mulching hay.</p>
      <p>Volunteers worked alongside students from St Stephen’s School to assemble and plant out the garden beds on November 6, with the men’s group providing meals and refreshments on the day.</p>
      <p>UnitingCare West Community connection officer Gerhard Rousseau said the project has given them a renewed focus.</p>
      <p>“Having mastered the art of cooking, the guys are now looking forward to the next challenge,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Not only will they learn how to cook creatively with their own fresh produce, they’ll also develop the skills that come with planting and harvesting a crop.</p>
      <p>“The best part of this project is that the guys will work alongside other local groups to provide meals for those in the community that need it most.”</p>
      <p>Men of Hope was developed in 2016, in response to a lack of groups in Perth’s outer north suburbs that were designed to bring people together and connect them to community.</p>
      <p>One of its members, <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/wanneroo-times/news/merriwa-mental-health-support-group-cooks-up-hope-for-men/">Kevin ‘Big Kev’ Newton, initiated the idea for cooking classes</a>, which he now runs fortnightly as a volunteer.</p>
