      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:00:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/adam-jones/" target="_blank">Adam Jones</a></address>
      <p>Steve Walsh has detailed some of the transfer bargains that he was keen to bring to Everton during his time with the club.</p>
      <p>The former Leicester cheif scout joined the Blues as a director of football in the summer of 2016, linking up with Ronald Koeman to lead the club into a new era under Farhad Moshiri.</p>
      <p>However, on the whole, the transfers conducted by the pair during their respective spells at Goodison Park proved to be their un-doing.</p>
      <p>While there were highlights such as deals for Idrissa Gueye and Jordan Pickford during two summers, the transfer window prior to the 2017/18 season proved disastrous - in particular failing to sign a suitable replacement for the outgoing Romelu Lukaku.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/steve-walsh">Walsh</a> believes things could have been different.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> chief has now opened up on some of the players he tried to bring to Goodison Park, with them going on to be vital players for other clubs across the Premier League and Europe.</p>
      <p>"While I was at Everton, I offered them Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire deals, when they were at Hull, and it was worth £20 million for the pair. Everton wouldn’t take them," Walsh told <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">The Athletic</a> .</p>
      <p>"I had a deal done for Jonny Evans too before he came to Leicester, but again they wouldn’t take him. Erling Haaland, the striker with Salzburg, I had him and his dad at the club with a deal done for £3.4m (€4m). The club wouldn’t back me."</p>
      <p>Walsh was eventually replaced as Everton's director of football in the summer of 2018, with Marcel Brands taking over the role.</p>
      <p>And the former Blues man also revealed a conversation he had with then-Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho when he was signing Lukaku from Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>He said: "When Jose signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, I remember saying to him, ‘You have to be careful with Lukaku. He is a big baby, you know.’ He said he could handle him.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think he really got Lukaku on-side mentally, which you have to do. That is the case with him and Paul Pogba. They aren’t my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team. I wouldn’t have touched them. Because they are good players doesn’t mean you are going to get a good team out of it."</p>
