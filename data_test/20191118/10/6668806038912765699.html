      <p>Box-office clashes seem to have become inevitable of late. We hear that Ajay Devgn’s Bhuj: The Pride Of India which also stars Sanjay Dutt and Sonakshi Sinha and John Abraham’s Attack are both slotted for an Independence Day 2020 release.</p>

      <p>After Satyameva Jayate (2018) and Batla House (2019), John has now reserved the Independence Day weekend of 2020 for his upcoming action-thriller. The actor revealed this while having an interview with a leading daily, "It’s Attack, which rolls on January 4 and opens on August 14. I’ve come to believe that the day belongs to me, not just because it’s a national holiday but also for the feelings it brings forth. Attack is an apt Independence Day release, patriotic without being jingoistic. It will be directed by Lakshya Anand, who assisted Kabir Khan on New York and Ek Tha Tiger, and Siddharth Anand on Bang Bang."</p>

      <p>There have been reports that the film might clash with Ajay Devgn-Sanjay Dutt's Bhuj: The Pride of India, which is all set to release on the same day, August 14, 2020. The film is based on a true event during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Ajay Devgn essays the role of Squadron Leader Vijay Karnik and will be directed by Abhishek Dudhaiya. </p>
