      <h1>Saudi Aramco abandons international roadshow for IPO</h1>
      <h2>State-owned oil company will confine marketing of shares to the kingdom and Gulf states</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:28:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author">Simeon Kerr, Arash Massoudi, Anjli Raval</a></address>
      <p>Saudi Arabia has abandoned plans to formally market shares in its state-owned oil company outside the kingdom and its Gulf neighbours, in the latest sign of the initial public offering’s shrunken ambitions.</p>
      <p>Bankers learnt on Monday that no formal European investor meetings would take place, a day after roadshows in the US and Asia were called off, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The decision is the latest setback for the kingdom, which will now seek to raise about $25bn through the flotation of Saudi Aramco — just a fraction of the $100bn it once sought. It will do so by relying heavily on local investors and those in the Gulf.</p>
      <p>“It’s all local now,” said one person briefed on the process.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia is attempting to list the oil company at a valuation acceptable to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who pushed for a $2tn valuation for almost four years and has made the IPO the centrepiece of planned economic reforms.</p>
      <p>However, Saudi authorities have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6a84cf06-090a-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">scaled back their expectations</a> in an effort to entice investors at home and abroad. On Sunday, the company revealed a price range for the shares that would value the company at between $1.6tn and $1.7tn.</p>
      <p>That valuation is still more than foreign institutions have been willing to pay, a message that was conveyed to the kingdom’s leadership several times in recent days, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>Saudi Aramco executives had been due to travel to cities in the US, Asia and Europe but now investor meetings are likely to be restricted to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman, according to one person briefed on the matter.</p>

      <p>Gathering orders for the shares is set to continue until December 4, with the stock due to price the following day and then begin trading on Riyadh’s Tadawul exchange a week later.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia intends to sell 0.5 per cent of the company to local retail shareholders, luring them with a bonus share scheme as long as they hold the stock for a fixed amount of time. The sweetener comes as authorities have leaned on local banks to make loans available to investors and as some wealthy families have been pressured to invest in the IPO. Saudi Aramco declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The remaining 1 per cent of the company being sold is expected to be taken largely by Saudi institutions and funds in the region. Saudi Arabia has also been courting state funds from Russia, China and elsewhere in Asia. These government-level discussions are likely to continue, another person briefed on the matter said.</p>
      <p>Institutional investors have raised concerns about the security of oil infrastructure after the attacks on key facilities in September, governance issues and state interference in Saudi Aramco’s corporate strategy. In recent weeks they briefed bankers that a valuation of $1.2-1.5tn was more reasonable.</p>
      <p>Foreign institutional interest will be limited to around 1,500 qualified foreign investors already able to trade on the Saudi stock exchange, or those nominated by Saudi Aramco or its advisers and approved by the market regulator.</p>
      <p>The limited pool of foreign investors is a blow to the kingdom, which saw the listing as a means to bring in a large pool of quality investors who are also shareholders in Saudi Aramco competitors such as Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil.</p>
      <p>One banker said his colleagues were deflated by the decision not to market the Riyadh listing to international investors after months of preparations for what was billed as comfortably the biggest initial public offering in history.</p>
      <p>That decision has raised fears among bankers that fees on the IPO would be cut sharply, said one person briefed on the process. The offering is being led by nine banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of America.</p>
      <p>No figure has yet been disclosed for the overall fee pool, although many banks were expecting to be rewarded handsomely for their work after years of preparations.</p>
      <p>Saudi Aramco, the world’s most profitable company with an annual net income of $111bn, is hoping to exceed the $25bn raised by Chinese ecommerce group Alibaba in 2014.</p>
