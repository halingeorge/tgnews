      <p>A rich feast of folk is on offer at the Bradninch Folk Club this month.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, November 19, Essex based Vicki Swan and Jonny Dyer are returning to the club.</p>
      <p>Club member Gerard Edwards said: “Audiences light up in response to Vicky and Jonny performance as every change of song, tune or instrument reveal another level and another aspect of their talent.</p>
      <p>“Jonny mostly plays his Fylde Falstaff guitar; his Taylor GA3 guitar and a custom gandola - guitar-shaped octave mandola - and Vicki’s primary instrument is the nyckelharpa, a Swedish keyed fiddle.</p>
      <p>“In a show, they masterfully get through what seems like a small orchestra of instruments including such instruments as small Scottish pipes and Swedish bagpipes, accordion flute, cow horn and recorder.</p>
      <p>“The duo’s instrumental skills are in demand by many other artistes for recordings and collaborations. Jonny Dyer is a much sought-after accompanist as seen with Daria Kulesh’s last visit to the club in February.</p>
      <p>“In addition to their instrumental C.V., Vicki and Jonny are impressive song arrangers and writers. They effortlessly blend traditional material with contemporary interpretations while equally creating original self-penned tunes and songs that are entirely at home in the tradition. Out of this combination, they have developed a sound that is both familiar and fresh.”</p>
      <p>Support will include a cub favourite and previous guest artist Ben Morgan Brown, a singer-songwriter and fingerstyle guitarist. His 2019 release Nameless Gold received national airplay.</p>
      <p>A first for Bradninch Folk Club will be Irish language performer Patrick Devine-Wright who learnt the language from his mother Deirdre, a fluent speaker from Galway and inherited a love of singing from his father Pat, one of a family of singers from Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Growing up in Dublin, he had a classical music education, beginning piano lessons at the age of 5 before studying trumpet at the Dublin College of Music. Patrick started singing at university and has sung with choirs including Anúna, the Cambridge Taverner Choir and Bel Canto. He was an understudy in the Riverdance show during its first West End run in the Hammersmith Apollo, and his influences include Iarla Ó’Lionaird, Séamus Begley and Martin Hayes</p>
      <p>Mr Edwards added: “The new venue, Bradninch Guildhall, provides a friendly community space to share live intimate performance of quality music.</p>
      <p>“It is recommended to arrive early with the doors opening at 7.45 pm and the performance starting at 8.00 pm.</p>
      <p>“You are assured of a personal welcome to the club. Entry is £6 per person with accompanied under 18 years free. For more information, visit our Facebook Group Page- Bradninch Folk Club or 01392 881105.”</p>
