      <p>Sri Lanka’s new president has been sworn in and appealed to minority Tamils and Muslims who voted against him to give their support.</p>
      <p>Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is credited with helping end the country’s long civil war, comfortably won Saturday’s presidential election.</p>
      <p>But minorities feared his election because of allegations of human rights violations against him dating from the war.</p>
      <p>Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya administered the oath of office to Mr Rajapaksa at the ancient Ruwanweli Seya Buddhist temple in north-central Sri Lanka.</p>
      <blockquote>As your new president I ask you (Tamils and Muslims) again to rally around me as true Sri Lankans for the sake of the future development of our country<cite>Gotabaya Rajapaksa</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“We knew from the beginning that our majority Sinhala people will be the biggest factor in our victory,” Mr Rajapaksa said in an address to the nation.</p>
      <p>“Even though I knew I could win the presidential election with the support of the Sinhala people alone, I made a special request to Tamil and Muslim people to be partners in that victory.</p>
      <p>“But their response was not to my expectation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But as your new president I ask you again to rally around me as true Sri Lankans for the sake of the future development of our country.”</p>

      <p>He also pledged to prioritise national security following Easter Sunday suicide attacks this year that killed 269 people and follow a neutral foreign policy.</p>
      <p>“We want to remain neutral in our foreign relations and stay out of conflicts among the world powers,” Mr Rajapaksa said.</p>
      <p>“We request all countries to respect our country’s unity and sovereignty in dealing with us.”</p>
      <p>Mr Rajapaksa was secretary of the defence ministry in a government led by his brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, and is credited with playing a crucial role in ending the separatist civil war by ethnic Tamil rebels.</p>
      <p>He is accused of serious human rights violations, including overseeing abductions, torture and extrajudicial executions.</p>

      <p>Some were tortured and released while others simply disappeared.</p>
      <p>The daughter of a prominent journalist killed in 2009 has accused Mr Rajapaksa of being behind her father’s murder.</p>
      <p>Under the Rajapaksa brothers, Sri Lanka’s military was accused of targeting civilians in the civil war and killing rebels and civilians who surrendered in the final days of the fighting.</p>
      <p>According to a UN report, about 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the final months of fighting alone.</p>
      <p>During the election campaign, Mr Rajapaksa pledged not to honour a United Nations Human Rights Council resolution that Sri Lanka agreed to in 2015 to investigate alleged human rights abuses by both government forces and Tamil Tiger rebels during the war.</p>
