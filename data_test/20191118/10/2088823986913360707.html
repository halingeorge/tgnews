      <h1>For GOP candidates in NY-27, 'conservative' seems downright wishy-washy</h1>

      <p>For Republicans hoping to succeed Chris Collins in the 27th Congressional District next year, the tried and true label of “conservative” suddenly seems downright wishy-washy.</p>
      <p>“Ultra-conservative,” “hyper-conservative” or even “right wing” seem more preferable to candidates wooing the party leaders who will choose among them for a 2020 special election. And that means praising President Trump, denouncing the latest gun control measures or defending tackle football for kids.</p>
      <p>You might say the new crop of congressional hopefuls is trying to “out-conservative” each other as they make their cases for the special election that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo hints could occur April 28.</p>
      <p>“When you get to this congressional district in an era of impeachment and bifurcated politics, I need a strong conservative,” said Erie County Conservative Chairman Ralph C. Lorigo, who will play a key role in the decision. “He or she has to make that case to us for this particular district in this particular time.”</p>
      <p>Official candidates so far include State Sens. Christopher L. Jacobs of Buffalo and Robert G. Ortt of North Tonawanda, former Darien Town Justice Beth A. Parlato, and health care firm employee Frank C. Smierciak II. Erie County Comptroller Stefan I. Mychajliw Jr. is also expected to join the race.</p>
      <p>Their claims of uber-conservative credentials loom as especially important because:</p>
      <p>• The 27th District remains a bastion of Republicanism and support for Trump. A survey conducted last year by Amherst pollster Barry Zeplowitz found 81% of Republicans view the president favorably.</p>
      <p>• Lorigo’s Conservative Party, with only about 13,000 members among the district’s approximately 475,000 voters, could again prove the “tail wagging the dog” by influencing the GOP. Unless Conservatives and Republicans agree on a mutual candidate, they run the risk of splitting their vote and opening the door to an underdog Democrat.</p>
      <p>• Powerful outside groups intent on electing the strongest Trump supporter are already working the district. The Club for Growth, a Washington super PAC that last year spent $23.2 million in congressional elections across the country, is renewing its attack on Jacobs as nowhere near conservative enough for the district.</p>

      <p>As a result, the candidates have cranked up their communications efforts in recent weeks. Jacobs, for example, sponsored legislation to halt new criminal justice reforms passed early this year by Albany’s new all-Democratic Legislature. He said the new Democratic bills would, in many cases, eliminate a judge’s discretion to impose bail or hold defendants in custody.</p>
      <p>“Could anyone imagine that the police could apprehend someone breaking into their home, and instead of putting them in jail, issue them an appearance ticket and send them on their way?” he asked.</p>
      <p>He did not mention his new bill sees little chance of passage in the Democratic Legislature, which just enacted its new criminal justice package.</p>
      <p>Also in recent days, Jacobs introduced a bill to end the automatic disclosure of information when applying for gun ownership, reminding voters that he is a long time opponent of the SAFE Act.</p>
      <p>Ortt, meanwhile, issued an Oct. 31 statement calling the House impeachment investigation “nothing more than a partisan attack on a sitting president going into the 2020 election.”</p>
      <p>“I am running for Congress to help put an end to this partisan witch hunt and help our president do the job the American people elected him to do,” he said.</p>
      <p>Then, on Nov. 9, Ortt joined Republican Assemblyman Angelo J. Morinello of Niagara Falls at a North Tonawanda rally opposing a bill to ban tackle football for youth under 12.</p>
      <p>Parlato joined the chorus by emphasizing her first-time candidate status and signing a pledge supporting term limits for members of Congress.</p>
      <p>“We have members preaching socialism on the left and need more people fighting back from a place of sanity," she said.</p>
      <p>But the most potent force in the early stages of the contest may be the Club for Growth, which last week sent oversized mailers to the Republican and Conservative leaders who will name a special election candidate some time in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>“This is a district that can and should have a true conservative and not a warmed over Democrat,” said Club for Growth spokesman Joe Kildea.</p>
      <p>The group has already spent about $35,000 for an initial round of dark and graphic mailers attacking Jacobs. In four 15-inch pieces aimed at “grasstops” Republicans and Conservatives mailed last week, Jacobs is depicted as a rhinoceros RINO (Republican in Name Only), holding a fistful of $100 bills while superimposed next to disgraced former Gov. Eliot L. Spitzer, and as supporting “higher taxes; more handouts.”</p>
      <p>“Jacobs voted to expand multiple government handouts, even backing free college tuition,” the mailer states.</p>
      <p>Jacobs said Friday he has no worries over mailings from outside groups and is targeted because of his strong position in the race.</p>
      <p>“The party chairs are sophisticated people who take this for what it is — outside money trying to influence their decision-making,” he said. “I have faith in them making up their minds on their own.”</p>
      <p>Jacobs also noted he has run with Conservative support throughout his career and carries the right credentials for a congressional endorsement from the party.</p>
      <p>Kildea said his group at this point wants only to blunt Jacobs, who enjoys considerable organizational support and boasts more than $1 million in his campaign treasury. Kildea stood by the mailers’ claims and defended its photo doctoring as a “very normal practice in politics.”</p>

      <p>Now local political leaders are reacting and asking questions about the Club for Growth claims.</p>
      <p>“I’m certainly going to have to bring these issues to Chris Jacobs,” Lorigo of the Conservative Party said. “He’s going to have to tell me if he voted for free tuition ... and tell him he will need to overcome this if he’s going to get help from us.”</p>
      <p>Jacobs said he can’t always offer 100% support to any state budget and that he voted for the new Excelsior scholarships as part of the overall spending plan. He also acknowledged his vote for new ride-hailing fees as part of the successful effort to introduce the service to upstate — just like fees accompanying taxi rides.</p>
      <p>Lorigo hopes to soon discuss the race with state Republican Chairman Nicholas A. Langworthy and emphasize the need for a united Republican/Conservative effort in the special, primary and general elections. But he also noted that Conservatives could conceivably nominate their own candidate if unimpressed by the Republican hopefuls.</p>
      <p>“We certainly don’t want to give it to the left,” he said. “But Republicans need to be respectful of us as we are of them.”</p>
      <p>Erie County Republican Chairman Karl J. Simmeth Jr. calls the Club for Growth effort “bullying” that will lessen the chances of the group’s preferred candidate.</p>
      <p>“I don’t need any Washington special interest groups who view us as simple-minded or small-town folks who don’t know anything,” he said. “We have our fingers on the pulse of the community and don’t need them.”</p>
      <p>He also reiterated his desire for a Republican outside the party’s ultra-conservative side because the district may feature many more Democrats in 2022 following reapportionment.</p>
      <p>“I want a Republican who is middle of the road who can appeal to both sides,” he said. “We don’t need anyone from way off on the far right.”</p>
