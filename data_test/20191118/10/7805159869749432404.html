      <h1>[Update: Now Working] Google Chrome’s annoying notification prompts will be less intrusive soon</h1>

        <i><b>Update (11/18/19 @ 10:45 AM ET):</b> The flag in Chrome for Android for making prompts less intrusive is now working in Canary.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Browsing the web in 2019 isn’t always a pleasant experience. Websites are constantly asking you to accept cookies, get your location, and, maybe most annoyingly, send notifications. Google is working on making those prompts less annoying in Chrome.</p>
      <p>A lot of people may not know that you can disable all notification prompts in Chrome (Site Settings), but if you prefer to keep it enabled, Chrome will soon make them less intrusive. A flag in Chromium nightly called “Quieter notification permission prompts” is the answer.</p>

      <p>This flag is currently not working, most likely because the code isn’t there yet, but it should be in Chrome Canary soon. It gives you a few different options: Default, Enabled, Enabled (Heads-up notifications), Enabled (mini-infobars), and Disabled. Since the flag isn’t functional right now, we don’t know <i>exactly</i> what these different modes look like. However, heads-up notifications are the typical pop-ups we’ve had in Android for a while. The “mini-infobar” may be a small overlay on top of the address bar.</p>
      <p>As mentioned, we should see this show up in the Chrome Canary channel soon (though that doesn’t guarantee it will work). We’ll then get a look at how much “quieter” the prompts appear. Anyone who has been annoyed by these notification requests will want to enable this flag as soon as it shows up. Google created the problem by allowing sites to send notifications in the first place, but at least they recognize the problems.</p>

      <h3>Update: Now Working</h3>
      <p>The flag that wasn’t working back in August is now live in the latest build of Chrome for Android on the Canary channel. When enabled, notification prompts are less intrusive, so you can still see them, but they don’t get in the way so much. The flag is titled “Quieter notification permission prompts” and you’ll want to select Enabled (force quiet notifications), Enabled (force heads-up notifications), or Enabled (force mini-infobars). The browser must be relaunched to apply the changes.</p>
