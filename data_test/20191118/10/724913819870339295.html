      <p><b>JSE-listed telecommunications</b> specialist Huge Group said on Monday that it has partnered with MTN South Africa to provide additional GSM voice services to its subsidiary companies.</p>
      <p>The move comes after an ugly dispute with current partner Cell C earlier this year landed up in court. Huge Group won that court battle, and the parties were ordered into an arbitration process.</p>
      <p>Huge Group CEO James Herbst told TechCentral on Monday that it remains the company’s goal to continue to do business with Cell C. But, he said, a “dual supplier relationship is always better than a single supplier”.</p>

      <p>Andy Openshaw, Huge Group’s chief operating officer, said the agreement with MTN will be the “new foundation for Huge Telecom’s full-suite telephony service”, which substitutes fixed-line copper cables with a wireless, GSM-based alternative for corporate telephony.</p>
      <p>“We believe that this partnership with MTN brings the credibility we need to aggressively grow this market segment,” Openshaw said in a statement. “We have proved that GSM is the perfect substitute for copper cables in delivering corporate PABX telephony solutions. Importantly, MTN has a quality network with significant coverage and is a highly respected mobile network operator that brings innovative solutions to market.”</p>
      <p>Huge Telecom has over 20 000 customers and 43 000 telephone lines. “With the Huge Group of companies, we think that we can bring significant competition to the fixed-line voice telephony market,” said Quintus de Beer, GM for technology at MTN.  — <i>© 2019 NewsCentral Media</i></p>
