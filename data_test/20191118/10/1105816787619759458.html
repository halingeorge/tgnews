      <h1>Marquez wins season-ending MotoGP</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:35:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>VALENCIA: </b>World champion Marc Marquez clinched his 12th MotoGP victory of the season in Sunday’s final race in Valencia ahead of French rookie Fabio Quartararo.</p>
      <p>Marquez, who secured his sixth premier category title last month, finished over a second clear of pole-sitter Quartararo who came second for the fifth time in his debut campaign.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard made a poor start from second place on the grid but steadily picked off his rivals one by one to win at Valencia for just the second time in his career.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a difficult weekend because we’ve tried new things,” said Marquez, who took his 56th MotoGP win. “It’s a perfect season which will be difficult to repeat.”</p>
      <p>Australian’s Jack Miller claimed third while triple MotoGP champion Jorge Lorenzo bid farewell to the sport with a 13th-place finish in his final race.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Spaniard announced his decision to retire on Thursday. He could be replaced by Marquez’s younger brother and Moto2 champion Alex at Honda next season.</p>
      <p>Quartararo again fell just short in his bid to become the first Frenchman to win a MotoGP race since 1999, but the 20-year-old was delighted with his first season among the elite.</p>
      <p>“Nobody could have imagined at the start of the season that I would have six pole positions and seven podiums. It’s incredible to finish the season in this way,” said Quartararo, who ended fifth in the overall standings.</p>
      <p>British rider Cal Crutchlow and Frenchman Johann Zarco, LCR Honda team-mates also with thoughts of an upgrade next year, crashed out prematurely Sunday.</p>
      <p>Crutchlow went down before Zarco, cut loose by KTM earlier this season, was sent skidding by 19-year-old Spanish debutant Iker Lecuona who followed the Frenchman to the deck.</p>
      <p>Zarco was examined by on-site medics before gingerly limping back to his team stable.</p>
      <p>Lecuona was filling in for the KTM Tech team in place of Miguel Oliveira, who was injured in the last race in Australia.</p>
