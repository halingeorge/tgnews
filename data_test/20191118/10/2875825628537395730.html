      <h1>Why is Lansdowne Road train station closed for the Republic of Ireland v Denmark?</h1>
      <h2>The Boys in Green face the Danes at a sold-out Aviva Stadium on Monday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:07:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p>Lansdowne Road train station will be closed for Monday night's crucial Euro 2020 qualifier between the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.</p>
      <p>The Boys in Green face the Danes at a sold-out Aviva Stadium as they bid to qualify for next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>Fans attending the vital match will have to get off at either Grand Canal Dock or Sandymount stations and make their way to the ground from there.</p>
      <p>The closure is a trial run for the four <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> games taking place in Dublin in a hope to ensure there is no congestion outside the stadium by ticketless fans.</p>
      <p>The station will be closed between 5pm and 11pm.</p>
