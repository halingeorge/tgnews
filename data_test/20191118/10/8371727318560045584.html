      <h1>How to Check 2019 KCPE Results Via SMS and Online Portal</h1>

      <p>National class 8 exams or KCPE were concluded a few weeks ago, and similar to a trend set by the then Education CS Fred Matiang’i, the results are out. The performance metrics will be made official any time from now by the current CS Professor George Magoha.</p>
      <p>The development marks a timely system that has since eliminated the need to hoard results until after Christmas celebrations for Class 8 pupils, and up to late February/early March of the following year for KSCE.</p>
      <p>Similar to past practices, Class 8 pupils will get access to results via two primary means: an SMS service that costs KES 20 or so depending on the carrier/bulk SMS distributor, and through an online <a href="https://www.knec-portal.ac.ke/">KNEC portal</a> where students can enter their exam credentials. Often, the online system is hit by many requests, and does not work for a couple of hours. It is, however, advised to verify SMS results with those posted on the site.</p>
      <p>Now, students or their parents/guardians need to fire up their SMS app and enter their index number on the text field before sending it to <b>20076</b>. The code is only available for<b> Safaricom</b> and <b>Airtel</b> customers as it has been the case in the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>We are certain the system has been optimized this time round, so those results should hit your phone in a timely manner (previously, it could take up to an hour or more, and some customers were refunded their airtime in instances when the system just failed to deliver).</p>
      <p>Lastly, these services will be available once the CS has announced the results, so you may need to wait until that happens before sending those SMSes.</p>
