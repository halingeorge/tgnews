      <p>Iran condemned the United States' support for "rioters" in a statement issued late Sunday, after two days of violent protests in the Islamic republic against a petrol price hike.</p>
      <p>The foreign ministry said that it was reacting to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's "expression of support... for a group of rioters in some cities of Iran and condemned such support and interventionist remarks".</p>
      <p>Protests erupted in Iran on Friday, hours after it was announced the price of petrol would rise to 15,000 rials a litre (12 US cents) from 10,000 for the first 60 litres and to 30,000 rials for any extra fuel bought after that each month.</p>
      <p>In a tweet on Saturday, Pompeo said in response to the demonstrations that "the United States is with you".</p>
      <p>Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi slammed his comments in Sunday night's statement.</p>
      <p>"The dignified people of Iran know well that such hypocritical remarks do not carry any honest sympathy," Mousavi was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>"The acts of a rioter and saboteur group supported by the likes of (Pompeo) have no congruity with the conduct of the wise Iranian people."</p>
      <p>The statement blasted Washington's "ill-intent" over its decision to reimpose sanctions on Tehran after the US withdrawal in May last year from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal.</p>
      <p>"It's curious that the sympathising is being done with the people who are under the pressure of America's economic terrorism," Mousavi said.</p>
