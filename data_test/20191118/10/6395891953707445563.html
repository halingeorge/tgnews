      <p><b>XENIA, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A man accused of the stabbing death of a man whose body was found in a nature preserve in Ohio has been indicted on charges of murder and felonious assault.</p>
      <p>Court records show 26-year-old Zyrian Atha-Arnett was indicted Friday in Greene County in the slaying of 26-year-old Leonid Clark, who went missing in January. The Yellow Springs man's body was found April 12 along the Little Miami River in the Glen Helen Nature Preserve in western Ohio.</p>
      <p>Greene County sheriff's detectives say Atha-Arnett stabbed Clark multiple times. Court records don't show an attorney for the Enon man.</p>
      <p>Investigators haven't commented on a potential motive. They say phone records show Atha-Arnett and Clark exchanged several text messages and calls prior to the slaying.</p>
