      <h1>Tay-K Reportedly Indicted For Shooting &amp; Killing Man In Chick-Fil-A Parking Lot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:43:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Bexar County, TX – Incarcerated rapper <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51282/title.tay-k-sued-for-allegedly-beating-down-65-year-old-storeowner">Tay-K</a> was reportedly indicted on a capital murder charge in Bexar County last week.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2019/11/15/texas-rapper-tay-k-47-indicted-for-murder-in-bexar-county-das-office-says/">ABC 12 San Antonio,</a> the Bexar County District Attorney’s Office has accused Tay-K — real name Taymor McIntyre — of shooting and killing Mark Anthony Saldivar during an April 2017 robbery.</p>
      <p>Tay-K, who was only 16 at the time of the shooting, was named as a triggerman in Saldivar’s murder as part of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the victim’s mother Lucia “Lucy” Saldivar last year.</p>

      <p>The suit says Saldivar was in a vehicle with Tay-K and two other people when Saldivar was robbed of his “expensive camera equipment” and forced out of the vehicle. Saldivar then “jumped onto the hood” of the car in an effort to stop them from getting away before the vehicle pulled into a Chick-fil-A parking lot.</p>
      <p>That’s when Tay-K allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot Saldivar to death, leaving the man to “die on the street.”</p>
      <p>Tay-K has already been convicted of a separate murder charge in Tarrant County and sentenced to<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52491/title.tay-k-is-all-scowls-in-new-mugshot-following-55-year-sentence"> 55 years in prison</a>. On August 9, he was extradited to the Bexar County Jail, where he’s currently awaiting trial.</p>
