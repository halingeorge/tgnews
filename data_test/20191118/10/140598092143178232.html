      <h1>Brazilian Grand Prix: How a chaotic dead rubber produced F1's best result in years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:39:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/luke-slater/" target="_blank">Luke Slater</a></address>
      <p>Formula One has been a fairly stale and predictable show over the past few years. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/06/21/mercedes-f1s-dominant-ever-team-analysing-success-eight-charts/">Mercedes have dominated since 2014</a>, with Ferrari and Red Bull taking the occasional win and gradually chipping away at their dominance.</p>
      <p>In the second half of 2019, though, Ferrari and Red Bull have been much stronger challengers to Mercedes. The next generation of F1 stars have gone wheel to wheel with the established greats.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/">The Brazilian Grand Prix</a> gave us a tough on track battle between two of those; Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, with Mercedes on the back foot and newly-crowned six-time champion Hamilton giving everything he had to challenge the Red Bull. Verstappen, though, was the class of the field.</p>
      <p>But there was more to celebrate in a race that produced arguably F1’s best result in years.  It has been nearly seven years since a team outside of Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull won a race. So difficult has it been for the other teams to challenge the triopoly that F1’s "Class B" has, rightly, been seriously talked about in the past few years.</p>
      <p>A fifth, sixth, or seventh place has often been something to celebrate for teams like McLaren, Alfa Romeo and Toro Rosso. But in Brazil they all had genuine reason to shout.  A chaotic and incident packed race gave us two first time podium finishers and a best-ever fifth for another. These three teams achieved their greatest results in years.</p>
      <p>The race itself was pulsating, with divergent strategies at the front, plenty of overtaking, some daring and bold moves and some clumsy and silly ones, too. But the result was even better.</p>
      <h3>Verstappen vs Hamilton’s captivating duel</h3>

      <p>12 months ago, Verstappen lost victory and then his head at Interlagos. He collided and spun with Esteban Ocon as the Racing Point attempted to unlap himself, handing a victory to Lewis Hamilton before angrily confronting Ocon in the pit lane. </p>
      <p>This year, though, Verstappen was at his brilliant and faultless best.  Quickest in all three qualifying sessions, he didn't let his advantage slip at the start, bursting off the line to lead Hamilton at the end of the first lap. His afternoon was not without difficulty, though, due to Hamilton's perseverance and two late Safety Car periods that put his win in danger. </p>
      <p>To emerge victorious, Verstappen twice had to overtake Hamilton and he did so with conviction. The first time came after Hamilton jumped the Red Bull at the pit stops but Verstappen brilliantly fought back to reclaim the place within a lap. First, he passed Leclerc, who had held up Hamilton, into turn 12 before coming seemingly from nowhere (albeit with the aid of DRS) to put one down the inside of Hamilton at turn one as the Mercedes jinked across to defend. It was clinical and showed the feel that Verstappen had at Interlagos all weekend. </p>
      <p>The second time was after Red Bull brought him in for a cheap stop and fresh tyres under the first Safety Car period. Mercedes kept Hamilton out, so Verstappen would have to overtake him if he wanted victory. And he did in double quick time.</p>

      <p>It was likely to happen anyway given the tyre advantage, but the Dutchman did not want to hang around, launching his attack immediately at the restart, this time putting a brilliant move around the outside at turn one, without the help of DRS. Again, it was a clinical move and great driving from both men. Hamilton was just feet away as they went side-by-side through the Senna Esses. The crowd approved.</p>
      <p>Even amid the chaos behind him – a second Safety Car was brought out by the Ferrari's clash on the back straight - Verstappen kept his cool under pressure to take a deserved and convincing win the hard way.  It was the type of polished, clinical, efficient and ruthlessly quick performance that Verstappen should aspire to. What a contrast to 12 months ago.</p>
      <h3>Gasly and Sainz (eventually) get their moment in the sun</h3>
      <p>If you want contrasts, though, look no further than Pierre Gasly. Dropped by Red Bull after a lacklustre 12 races, replaced by Alexander Albon and demoted back to Toro Rosso, he has found some of that spark of his debut year again.</p>
      <p>Although the swap looks entirely justified – Gasly scored just 63 points in his 12 races at Red Bull whilst Albon notched 68 in his first seven – the Frenchman has been outstanding in his return to his old team. Even before this weekend he scored points in four of the last seven rounds, outclassing team-mate Daniil Kvyat in the process. In the last six races, his average qualifying position has been 9.83 and he has made it into Q3 for the last four races.</p>
      <p>His second place in Brazil obviously owed a little to fortune here, with frontrunners fouling up and retiring, but Gasly should drink this in. Even without those incidents he would have likely finished best of the midfield runners and he was comfortably ahead of them all weekend.</p>

      <p>His sheer delight on the team radio after holding off a charging Hamilton at the chequered flag by just 0.062s was about more than just this race, you felt. Gasly was not much of a Red Bull driver but he is one hell of a Toro Rosso one. He now moves back up to sixth in the championship on 95 points, level with Carlos Sainz.</p>
      <p>Sainz, too, got his moment in the sun after another brilliant drive in a season littered with them. He started dead last on the grid and finished fourth on the road and, with Hamilton's penalty, moved up to third for his first top three finish in F1.</p>
      <p>It took a while for it to be confirmed and he unfortunately missed out on the champagne spraying after the race, but it is no less a notable achievement for it. Last year McLaren lost their biggest asset in Fernando Alonso and looked lost. His compatriot has not been such a bad replacement at all and looks a good man to lead the team’s revival.</p>
      <h3>This was F1's best result in years but it should not be a freak occurrence</h3>
      <p>A race like this makes you feel good about F1 again. Since the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/06/23/french-grand-prix-worst-race-have-ever-seen-formula-one-must/">French Grand Prix</a>, we have had numerous unpredictable, tense and occasionally chaotic races. In Brazil, this was combined on a grand scale: brilliant fighting at the front, another Vettel error with massive consequences, a dramatic finale and two drivers taking their first ever podium whilst another, Alexander Albon, came agonisingly close to his maiden top-three finish. Antonio Giovinazzi, in fifth, too, got his best ever result.</p>
      <p>With both championships already wrapped up, an end-of-term vibe seemed to fill the race, with drivers taking risks you would struggle to find at the earlier end of the season. Even Hamilton, whose genuine errors in the past few seasons can be counted on one hand, slipped up, lunging optimistically down the inside of Albon, causing the Red Bull to spin and getting a five-second time penalty for his troubles.</p>

      <p>In normal circumstances, you would not see either a Toro Rosso or a McLaren on the podium and the fact that they both (eventually) ended up there says a lot about the state of the race at the front. This was far from normal. It was the first time since the United States Grand Prix in November 2013, and the first time in the turbo-hybrid era, that there was no Ferrari or Mercedes in the top three. </p>
      <p>The role the circuit plays should not be understated. The Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace – or Interlagos – is an excellent track in the old style, full of undulations, bumps and it is a great test of driver ability. It offers in spades what some of F1's more sanitised circuits lack. The drivers love it, the crowds love it. It would be a tremendous shame to lose it from the calendar.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, F1 needs a series where results like this happen more frequently, not under freak circumstances. There was a big slice of fortune for two of the podium finishers but that should not colour what was the sport’s best – and most enjoyable – result in years.</p>
