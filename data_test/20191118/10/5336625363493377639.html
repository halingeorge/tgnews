      <h1>Tesla casually updates Model 3 to be devilishly quick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:05:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/stan-schroeder/" target="_blank">Stan Schroeder</a></address>
      <p>Tesla Model 3 is advertised as an affordable electric sedan, but it does pack a punch when it comes to performance, especially in the more expensive trim. </p>
      <p>But with a recent performance update, sent to Model 3 vehicles over-the-air (OTA), Tesla improved the acceleration numbers significantly, making even the cheaper Model 3 trims faster than many sports cars. </p>
      <p><a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/17/tesla-model-3-0-60mph-times-then-and-now-all-trims-compared/">Electrek</a> has the rundown of all the numbers. It gets a bit complicated when you factor in the models that aren't sold anymore, but the highlights are the Tesla Model 3 Performance, whose advertised 0-60mph time has been cut from 3.5 to 3.2 seconds, and the Tesla Model 3 Long Range with All-Wheel Drive whose 0-60mph time has been improved from 4.5 to 4.4 seconds according to Tesla's official numbers. </p>
      <p>Some discontinued models, like the Tesla Model 3 Mid-Range, got an even bigger bump, though measured through unofficial sources (see video below). Its 0-60mph time was originally advertised with a 5.6 seconds, and Tesla enthusiast nukem384 was consistently able to get there in 4.9 seconds. </p>

      <p>The Model 3 vehicles got a similar performance update in March, and it's unclear how much the performance has improved with the latest update compared to that one. Put it all together, though, and you get a significant performance bump in every trim.</p>
      <p>You have to hand it to Tesla: This type of free, OTA update which significantly improves your car's performance is bound to make owners happy. In most situations, the difference between a 5.6 and 4.9 0-60 mph time would cost you a fair amount of money. </p>
      <p>Besides the performance update, Tesla also increased the range of its Model 3 cars; for example, the Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus range is now advertised at 250 miles, up from 220. </p>
