      <p>DUBAI: Indian <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vijender-singh">boxing</a> star <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vijender-singh">Vijender Singh</a> will square off against two-time former Commonwealth super middle-weight champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Charles-Adamu">Charles Adamu</a> of Ghana in his next professional bout on November 22.</p>
      <p>Vijender, managed by the legendary Bob Arum's Top Rank Promotions and IOS Boxing, made his US debut earlier this year in July, recording an 11th successive win, beating <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mike-Snider">Mike Snider</a>.</p>
      <p>WBO Asia Pacific and Oriental super middleweight champion, who is 34, will take on the 42-year-old Adamu, hailing from Ghana, in a 10-round fight. Adamu is a veteran of 47 fights with a record of 33-14-0, including 26 knockouts. He competed most recently in February this year, winning via a Technical Knockout to end a four-bout losing streak.</p>

      <p>"After having rigorous training sessions for more than two months, I am fully prepared to end my year on a winning note. For me this fight will be a build up to the world title which I am aiming in 2020," said the Indian, who has eight Knockout wins to his credit.</p>
      <p>"No doubt Adamu is an experienced opponent, he will give me a few new tests, he has done more rounds than me, but will that compete with the power that I have and when I start landing my shots I don't believe he will be standing around too long," said Vijender.</p>
      <p>Adamu said he is confident of ending Vijender's winning run.</p>
      <p>"I will bring my experience into play and look to play on the mind of Vijender Singh. Before all my fights I spend time analysing my opponent's strengths and weaknesses," he said.</p>
      <p>"If he thinks I'll be one of his earlier opponents whom he'll brush by then he's very mistaken. I am a two-time former Commonwealth super middleweight champion and will put up a tactical master-class he's never seen before," he added.</p>
