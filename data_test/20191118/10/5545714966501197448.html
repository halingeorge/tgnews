      <p>Following on from the fresh reveal of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../new-guilty-gear-titled-guilty-gear-strive-faust-returns-to-the-roster-572816.phtml"><i>Guilty Gear Strive</i>'s new moniker</a>, Arc System Works has also announced that <i>Guilty Gear 20th Anniversary Pack</i> is headed to Nintendo Switch in North America. The double pack was previously only made available in other territories such as Europe and Japan.<br/><br/>The <i>Guilty Gear 20th Anniversary Pack</i> includes a physical copy of the game - comprised of the original Guilty Gear and <i>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R</i> - a steelbook casing, a commemorative coin and, best of all a Sol Badguy headband. Imagine wearing that? Ehh, I'm not your dad, do what you will.<i> Guilty Gear 20th Anniversary Pack</i> includes a revamped multiplayer system, Joy-Con support, and the option to check out the rare Korean soundtrack. <br/><br/>No release date was announced, but at least North American fans, (or those who didn't import a European edition), can take comfort that some classic <i>GG</i> action will be headed their way in the future.</p>
