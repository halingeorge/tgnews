      <p>BASF has acquired <a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/en/">Sculpteo</a>, a France-based online 3D printing service provider, for an undisclosed sum (via <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/basf-s-offre-le-francais-sculpteo-specialiste-de-l-impression-3d-20191118">Le Figaro</a>).</p>
      <p>BASF New Business, the chemical giant’s innovation-focused group, is said to have purchased the company to market and establish new industrial 3D printing materials more quickly for its dedicated 3D printing subsidiary, which it recently announced would be rebranded as <a href="https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/organization/locations/europe/german-companies/basf-3d-printing-solutions-gmbh.html">Forward AM</a>.</p>
      <p>Founded 10 years ago by Eric Carreel and Clément Moreau, with locations in both Paris and San Francisco, management staff at Sculpteo are said to be remaining in place. The agreement is expected to become effective over the next few weeks pending regulatory approval by the relevant authorities.</p>
      <p>“Through the acquisition of Sculpteo, we can provide customers and partners with even faster access to our innovative 3D printing solutions. In addition, our customers will benefit from an extended range of services”, explains Dr. Dietmar Bender, Managing Director BASF 3D Printing Solutions. “Together with Sculpteo, we are pursuing our goal of establishing additive manufacturing as a proven technology for industrial mass production.”</p>
      <p>At present, Sculpteo offers a wide range of 3D printing options including 10 technologies and access to more than 75 materials and finishing options. Germany-based BASF intends to develop Sculpteo’s current platform into a global network and says existing customers and partners will be able to benefit from its 3D printing business to further expand their customer bases and material capabilities.</p>
      <p>“We are excited to join the BASF team and thus benefit from BASF’s outstanding R&amp;D to provide our customers with innovative solutions”, commented Moreau, the co-founder and CEO of Sculpteo (who will be staying on).</p>
