      <p>The event in September was organised for staff at The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust as a thank you for the “great care” that Jonathan Williams, director of Mid Wales Shooting Centre, received after suffering a heart attack earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Jonathan said: “The charity day was a huge success and with the support of local and national companies, the generosity of the shooters and visitors and a very successful raffle, we raised £6,500 for SaTH Charity’s cardiology fund.”</p>
      <p>The Sporting Open High Gun was won by Paul Hutchinson and the Joint DTL High Guns was won by Russell Vaughan and Andrew Greenstock.</p>
      <p>Jonathan added: “I am delighted we have been able to give something back to the trust in recognition of the great care I received. Everyone I met when in hospital was amazing, they took great care of me after I suffered a heart attack while running along the beach from Aberdyfi to Tywyn.”</p>
      <p>Mid Wales Shooting Centre, near Newtown, is situated in over 300 acres and over the past 20 years has played host to World, European, British, Welsh and English Championships.</p>
      <p>Andrew James, who heads up the SaTH Charity, said: “On behalf of everyone at the trust, which runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, I would like to say a huge thank you to Jonathan and everyone at the Mid Wales Shooting Centre.</p>
      <p>“This extremely generous donation will be gratefully received by the department.</p>
      <p>"It will help the team continue to provide great patient care. The fact the money was raised during a fun day out for our staff make it even better.”</p>
      <p>SaTH Charity is a registered charity that makes a real difference to the patients, affected friends and family, and members of staff at RSH and PRH.</p>
