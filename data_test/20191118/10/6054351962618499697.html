      <h1>Lil Reese Shows Off Shooting Injury &amp; Demands $1M For VladTV Interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T10:10:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Chicago, IL – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52258/title.lil-reese-unveils-getbackgang-2-project">Lil Reese</a> appears to be back home after he was <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53440/title.lil-reese-reportedly-in-critical-condition-following-shooting">shot last week.</a> A couple of days after resurfacing on Instagram Live, the Chi-Town native has shared a photo of his injury to the social media platform.</p>
      <p>In the photo, the staples in his neck are painfully visible, presumably the result of a bullet tearing through his throat. Judging by his caption, he’s thankful to be alive.</p>
      <p>“Made 4 it,” he wrote. “Lifes a gamble I got hella luck.”</p>

      <p>Although <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.40448/title.lil-reese-hospitalized">Reese</a> expressed his apparent gratitude, he kept business on his mind, too. In a tweet from Saturday (November 16), the 26-year-old responded to a fan who suggested DJ Vlad would do anything to get him on his couch. He responded by insisting he’d need $1 million to make it happen.</p>
      <p>“Tell him I need a million for this story,” he wrote. “this shit ain’t fake or free shit. bigger than 50 rick Ross and whoever els.</p>

      <p>“Very happy that you survived the shooting,” he said. “But nobody’s going to pay you even 1 % of $1 million for that interview.”</p>

      <p>Lil Reese is evidently on the mend. Days after being <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53440/title.lil-reese-reportedly-in-critical-condition-following-shooting">shot in the neck,</a> the 26-year-old Chicago native resurfaced on Instagram Live, although his face was mostly covered up by a hoodie.</p>
      <p>In the clip, he appears to be sitting in a car and listening to some R&amp;B. However, he doesn’t say a word.</p>

Investigators revealed a car pulled up on Reese and fired multiple rounds with an AK-47.</p>
      <p>Witnesses say Reese left in a separate car and was discovered by police at South Suburban Medical Center in Hazel Crest. He was later transferred to a Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in “critical condition.”</p>
      <p>The suspect reportedly fled in a white or grey Chevy Malibu with tinted windows and Wisconsin plates.</p>
