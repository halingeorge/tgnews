      <p>Billionaire Michael Bloomberg on Sunday walked back his long-time support for the controversial "stop and frisk" policing policy that disproportionately targeted black and Latino New Yorkers as he mulled jumping in the race for president.</p>
      <p>"I was wrong, and I'm sorry," the former mayor of the US financial capital told a predominantly black megachurch in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old had long defended his backing of the aggressive technique, which gave the city's police broad powers to search anyone they suspected of criminality.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Bloomberg continued to back the programme - which is being phased out - even after a federal judge said in 2013 it violated constitutionally protected minority rights.</p>
      <p>The media tycoon's speech at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn's deprived East New York neighbourhood appeared to be a tacit acknowledgement of the crucial minority backing he will need as he weighs a concerted challenge to US President Donald Trump in 2020.</p>

        <b>'Erosion of trust'</b>

      </p>
      <p>At the 2011 peak of "stop and frisk" policing, 87% of some 685 000 stops targeted black or Latino people, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union.</p>
      <p>Around the same proportion of people stopped were cleared of wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Citing the "erosion of trust" his stance had created among ethnic minorities, Bloomberg said: "I can't change history."</p>
      <p>"However, today I want you to know that I realise back then, I was wrong, and I'm sorry," he added.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg's words were met with a sceptical response as critics lambasted his reversal as vote pandering.</p>
      <p>"He's right to apologise but voters should not fall for this," tweeted Kumar Rao, senior counsel at the Center for Popular Democracy.</p>
      <p>"The apology was a decade late for those who were humiliated, harassed and intimidated by the government that is supposed to serve them," wrote New York Times opinion columnist Mara Gay.</p>
      <p>"This Sunday, he finally asked black New Yorkers for their forgiveness. And their vote."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Bridge builder'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bloomberg has submitted paperwork in Arkansas and Alabama but has not announced his candidacy among a crowded field that includes another latecomer - former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.</p>
      <p>Patrick became the 18th candidate in the race on Thursday, less than three months before the first nomination votes are cast in Iowa.</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old former civil rights lawyer told NBC on Sunday he had considered announcing much earlier but held off when his wife of 35 years was diagnosed with uterine cancer.</p>
      <p>"I think that I have a record of being a bridge builder," he said on talk show <i>Meet the Press</i>.</p>
      <p>"I think that's pretty important at a time when not just the party in some respects but the nation is deeply divided."</p>
      <p>Patrick was one of the first African-American governors in the country, serving eight years in office. He is friends with party dignitaries including the last Democratic president, Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>"We are in crisis in many respects here in America, and we used a crisis in Massachusetts to come out stronger economically, stronger socially and more fair," he added.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to see if those experiences and that aptitude and that skill set can be offered in service to our nation."</p>
      <p>He broke with the majority of other Democratic candidates, however, when he declined to swear off taking donations from super PACs, political entities that can accept unlimited contributions by a single individual.</p>
      <p>"I will have something to say about that (from a) policy point of view as we get a little further along," he said.</p>
      <p>"But if there is going to be Super PAC money that supports me... the sources should be fully disclosed."</p>
