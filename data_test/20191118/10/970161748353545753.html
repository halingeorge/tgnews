      <p>Two yachts worth more than £15,000,000 have been incinerated in a blaze that took almost a whole weekend to put out.</p>
      <p>It took over 60 firefighters and three fire boats to get the fire under control after it started early on Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, US.</p>
      <p>Crews were still on the scene on Sunday afternoon extinguishing hot spots and taking down scaffolding which was now collapsing around the cremated boats.</p>
      <p>Arlene Meyer and her husband heard ‘three big explosions’ and called emergency services at around 4:30am on Saturday.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘I was just so amazed that it went up in flames in one day.’</p>

      <p>Local firefighters believe the fire began on one yacht and was spread to the other by winds, leaving both wrecked.</p>
      <p>They said the 160-foot Trinity yacht named Lohengrin was worth between £9 million and £12 million ($7-$16 million) while the 110-foot Christianson vessel named Reflections was worth around £4 million to £6 million ($6-£8 million).</p>
      <p>Officials believe one of the yachts was being renovated and are investigating whether that had anything to do with the fire.</p>
      <p>However the cause is still unknown and firefighters cannot get close enough to investigate thoroughly due to the risk of collapsing scaffolds.</p>
      <p>There were no injuries as a result of the blaze.</p>
