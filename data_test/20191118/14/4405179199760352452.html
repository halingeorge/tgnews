      <h2>With Black Friday due 29 November, many retailers are launching deals early. We round up the most brilliant early Black Friday bargains available on inkjet, laser and AirPrint printers around right now across all major UK retailers like Currys PC World, Amazon, Ryman and more.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:31:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/karen-haslam/" target="_blank">Karen Haslam</a></address>
      <p>Retailers like Currys PC World and AO have kicked off Black Friday sales already, though the date itself is reserved for 29 November. With early deals arriving, it's a great time to pick up a deal on printer. </p>
      <p>We'll be keeping track of the best Black Friday printer deals right here, but in the meanwhile you can browse through early Black Friday offers right now. It's also a good opportunity to see where prices stand now so that you know whether you're truly saving when Black Friday arrives.</p>
      <p>If you're worried about not getting the best price until the big day itself, we'd advise checking out what the sale policies are. Currys, for instance, promises that its prices won't reduce any further once Black Friday starts, and if prices do decrease, the retailer will refund customers the difference.</p>

      <h3>Best printer discounts: What to look for</h3>
      <p>There are two main types of printer: inkjet and laser, which are each available in either colour or mono.</p>
      <p>If you're only (or almost entirely) going to be printing text, opt for a mono laser: this will deliver crisp text, fast output and low ink costs. If you plan to print photos (or a mixture of photos and text), we'd recommend an inkjet - but for <i>serious</i> photo printing look for a dedicated photo printer with separate cartridges for each colour.</p>
      <p>It's important to factor in the cost of replenishing the toner and other consumables over the lifetime of the printer. And this is a slow-moving market, so don't discount printers from a few years ago; the latest products aren't always the best.</p>
      <p>You'll find that most modern printers include a scanner; we'd also recommend looking for WiFi capabilities, as this means you can print from your iPhone and iPad, for example, without messing about with cables. The final things to look for are print speed, USB ports, memory card slots, high-capacity paper trays and double-sided printing.</p>
      <p>For more detailed advice on choosing the right printer for you, take a look at our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac/best-printer-for-mac-ipad-iphone-2018-3592199/">Best printer for Mac, iPad &amp; iPhone</a> group test, as well as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3686938-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fapple%2Fbest-printer-deals-3686938%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fprinting%2Fbest-instant-photo-printers-3631224%2F">Best instant photo printers</a>.</p>
      <h3>Where to find Black Friday printer deals</h3>
      <p>The following sites often sell printers excellent deals all year round, but specifically go all out for Black Friday. (We've linked to the printer sections of the websites to make your life slightly easier.)</p>
      <p>Remember that deals don't last very long, so your best bet would be to check them regularly and act decisively when you spot a bargain.</p>
      <p>But don't be in such a rush that you don't do research before buying. While checking reviews, find out the usual selling price, because some retailers have been known to put prices <i>up</i> ahead of big sales so the discounts seem more impressive.</p>
