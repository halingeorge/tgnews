      <h1>Tory politician kicked out of party after 'offering to whip a woman on Twitter'</h1>
      <h2>Councillor Steve Iles, who had been the Mayor of Medway, has been expelled from the Conservative Party over a series of inappropriate comments he made on social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:28:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>A Tory politician has been kicked out of the party over making inappropriate sexual comments on social media.</p>
      <p>The remarks made by the local politician included him 'offering to whip a woman on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> '.</p>
      <p>Councillor Steve Iles, who had been Mayor of Medway, was expelled from the Conservative Party after the “thoroughly unacceptable” <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> and Twitter posts emerged.</p>
      <p>In one Facebook post, Iles, from Medway, Kent, posted a picture of a bacon sandwich with the caption: “I am proud to be English”.</p>
      <p>Bosses felt the implication was that he was inferring that those who do not eat pork for religious reasons were somehow less English.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>In another tweet, Iles responded to a woman who had shared a photo of herself posing in lingerie asking Mr Motivator to “whip me into shape”.</p>
      <p>Iles replied: “Shape is fine, if I can help with the whipping…?”</p>
      <p>He claimed that his account had been hacked, and has since deleted both his Facebook and Twitter accounts.</p>
      <p>Iles has been a long-serving councillor in Strood North, Kent, and was elected as Medway’s deputy mayor this year having served as its mayor the year before.</p>
      <p>While he will remain a local councillor, the Conservatives confirmed that Iles had been thrown out of the party.</p>
      <p>Councillor Alan Jarrett, the Tory leader of Medway council, said: “As a result of thoroughly unacceptable posts on social media, Councillor Steve Iles has been expelled from the Conservative Party.</p>
      <p>“The posts in question are completely contrary to the values of both the Medway Conservative Group and the Conservative Party nationally, and do not adhere to our strong commitment to diversity and inclusivity.</p>
      <p>“I have met with Councillor Iles and explained that his actions are unacceptable, and as a consequence he will no longer enjoy the Conservative whip or be able to sit as a Conservative councillor.</p>
      <p>“On a personal note, I sincerely regret any offence the actions of Councillor Iles may have caused.”</p>
      <p>Medway council confirmed that no formal disciplinary proceedings have been triggered against Iles.</p>
      <p>Mr Iles said: "I regret any offence that was caused and none was meant whatsoever."</p>
