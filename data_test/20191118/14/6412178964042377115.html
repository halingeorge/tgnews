        <b>Reading striker Danny Loader is attracting the interest of Manchester United, according to a reliable source.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Sky Sports News </i>report that “United are one of several Premier League clubs considering a bid for Reading’s talented young striker”.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old, who made his debut under Jaap Stam as a 16-year-old, almost left the Madejski Stadium on deadline day last summer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.getreading.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/loaders-message-reading-fc-fans-16745744"><b>Loader was heading for a move to Wolves, but the deal fell through and shortly after he said:</b></a> “Everyone knows a Premier League club tried to sign me in the transfer window, but it wasn’t to be.</p>
      <p>“I’m very ambitious, my dream is to play on the biggest stage and you never know when these opportunities will come around again.</p>
      <p>“I hope that is understandable. To be clear I never handed in a transfer request and I trained on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been at Reading for years and I’ll always be respectful towards the club. I’m still a Reading player and that means I will give 100 per cent, as I always have done.</p>
      <p>“My focus now is to continue to build on the positives I had last season and always looking on where I can improve. Thanks for all your continued support.”</p>
      <p>The speedy Loader is though out of contract this summer and apparently talks on a new deal have stalled with the Royals and United are interested in signing the former England youth player, who has made six first-team appearances this season.</p>
