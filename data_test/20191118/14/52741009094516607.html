      <p>WINNIPEG — A man in Winnipeg is facing charges after he allegedly chased a door-to-door salesperson down a street with a gun.</p>
      <p>Police say a telecommunications service rep encountered an upset resident of a west-end house on Friday evening and was followed out by the occupant prior to a confrontation on the street.</p>
      <p>They say the man then went inside, came back out with a gun and got into a vehicle to follow the salesperson, who was able to hide in another residence.</p>
      <p>Police were called and went to the suspect's home, but he refused to come out and nearly three hours passed before a tactical team safely took him into custody.</p>
      <p>Police say a search of the home turned up 12 guns with ammunition.</p>
      <p>Donald Bruce Elliott, who is 51, remains in custody on five firearms-related charges. (CTV Winnipeg)</p>
