      <h1>More Automakers Offering Impressive Deals For Black Friday Sales</h1>
      <h2>Some deals have already started, and many are good through the end of the year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:46:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/christopher-smith/" target="_blank">Christopher Smith</a></address>
      <p>Are you in the mood to spend some serious money this holiday season? 2019 hasn’t been the best year for automakers, with many companies reporting stagnant or declining sales compared to 2018. As such, there could be some pretty good deals for folks considering a new car purchase or lease. We’ve already featured some upcoming Black Friday <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/category/pricing/">pricing</a> deals, and a fresh report from <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/deals-articles/best-black-friday-car-deals"><i>CarsDirect</i></a> lists even more discounts from a plethora of manufacturers in the U.S. market, covering everything from <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/sedan/">sedans</a> to<a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/truck/"> trucks</a>, and of course <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/suv-crossover/">SUVs</a>.</p>

      <p>Naturally, there’s fine print (and not-so-fine print) that needs mentioning ahead of time. Some of the deals are region-specific, so you’ll most definitely want to check with your local dealership or at the automaker’s website to see if your location is part of the promotion. Most promotional lease or finance rates require good credit, and some deals cannot be combined with others. You know, all the basic stuff.</p>
      <p>That said, here’s a shortlist of some noteworthy deals:</p>
      <h3>FCA</h3>
      <p>Employee Pricing (approximately five percent discount) and cashback for select 2019 models including:</p>

      <h3>Subaru</h3>
      <p>It’s not often we see deals from <a href="https://www.motor1.com/subaru/">Subaru</a>, but the 2020 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/subaru/ascent/">Ascent </a>can be financed at 0.9 percent for four years. Also, the lease rate for Ascent drops by $20 per month. These offers certainly aren’t as lucrative as others we’ve seen, but with the way Subies hold value over the years, it could make for a mighty impressive long-term deal.</p>
