      <p>The Readers Club of District Central Library, Tiruchi, along with Rotary Club Phoenix organised a special training and awareness programme on menstrual hygiene management for girls with special needs in the city on Monday.</p>
      <p>S. Amudhavalli, City Engineer, Tiruchi City Corporation, inaugurated the event and said that parental care is most important for children with special needs, especially prepubescent girls. “Mothers must keep track of the girls bodily changes and educate them. All girls go through a period of confusion when they hit puberty,” she said.</p>
      <p>M. A. Aleem, neurologist addressed the gathering of parents and urged them to teach their children about good touch and bad touch. “Girls with special needs are very loving and caring, and therefore more vulnerable. Talk to them and encourage free conversation”, he said. Dr. Aleem also asked mothers to keep a calendar to track the girls’ menstrual cycle.</p>
      <p>The programme was led by trainers Sudha Tilak and Shankar Subbiah. Ms. Tilak began her session with games and focused on the importance of menstrual hygiene. Mr. Subbiah spoke on the various government welfare schemes available for the welfare of children with disabilities.</p>
      <p>District Library officer A. P. Sivakumar, Rotary Club Phoenix president Natarajan Sundaram, members of the Readers Forum and around 100 girls from across the city took part in the event.</p>
