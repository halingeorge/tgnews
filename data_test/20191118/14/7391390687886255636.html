      <p>If you haven’t read <i>Queenie</i> yet you need to get yourself to your nearest book shop. The definition of a page turner, it charts the story of a young black journalist growing up in South London and has become <i>the </i>book to read in 2019. Candice Carty-Williams' debut novel has been so successful, in fact, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/do-it-for-the-applause-candice-carty-williams-on-why-her-readers-mean-the-most-19262525"><i>Queenie </i>is now being made into a Channel 4 show</a>. So, what are the details?</p>
      <p>The hype around Carty-Williams after the publication of her <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/candice-carty-williams-my-queenie-speaks-for-a-whole-other-britain-j0thkbc7g"><i>Sunday Times</i> best seller</a> has been massive and, on Nov. 15, 2019, the radio and TV magazine Broadcast Now revealed that the writer was in the <a href="https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/channel-4/channel-4-eyes-adaptation-of-queenie/5144796.article">early stages of adapting her critically acclaimed novel</a> for Channel 4.</p>
      <p>After the article was published, Carty-Williams took to twitter and said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m not sure if this is out because I’ve told the wrong person or because C4 have announced it but either way <a href="https://twitter.com/CandiceC_W/status/1195337218375720960">it’s TRUE and I am EXCITED</a> to bring <i>Queenie</i> to the small (ish) screen.”</blockquote>
      <p>I reached out to Carty-Williams literary agent to establish if there’s any more news but am yet to hear back. But one thing I knowfor sure is, if you’re a fan of <i>Queenie</i>, good things are coming your way.</p>
      <p>Carty-Williams’ warm, intelligent, raw, and funny prose is what brought <i>Queenie </i>captured the hearts of so many people, and now we get to see her words come to life in a whole new way.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the book<i> </i>in an interview with the <i>Evening Standard</i>, Carty-Williams touched upon the importance of characters such as Queenie and what they can represent for readers:</p>
      <blockquote>“Understanding that you are not the only person experiencing something is the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/candice-cartywilliams-interview-a4125761.html">beginning of getting through it.</a> It was important to write <i>Queenie </i>because you see how all these small things contribute to diminishing one girl’s sense of value. Every time someone reminds her that she is different [by not being white] — even doing little things like asking to touch her hair — she is affected. Readers have said they wish they’d seen braids on book covers when they were younger — they wouldn’t have spent so long straightening their hair with chemicals that burn your scalp.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’ll be very interesting to see how Carty-Williams and Channel 4 lift the characters from the pages of the novel and translate them for the screen. I for one can't wait to see whose cast in the titular role. Watch this space.</p>
