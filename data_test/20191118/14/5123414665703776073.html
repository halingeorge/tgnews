      <p>This album had a long and strange road to completion. They actually turned in an album last year with all of the assets set for release. Then they listened back to the album decided it wasn’t good enough and canceled the project. The next week they got back in the studio and did it all over again. </p>
      <p>“We loved the record we made but for some reason, it didn't feel right, so we didn't keep anything, we shut ourselves on the boat in Amsterdam where we work and didn't stop until we'd written a new album,” explain the trio about their process. </p>
      <p>“There were a lot of moments when we weren't sure we'd ever find what it was we were looking for. On the way, we lost friends, lost loves, battled health issues, lost an album, lost each other and came back together again. It feels like a lifetime has passed but the world keeps spinning and I guess we knew we would eventually find our strength and make the album we wanted to make.” </p>
