      <h1>Ken Shamrock dares Jorge Masvidal to fight bare knuckle — ‘We’d love to find out how bad he is’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:29:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse Holland</a></address>
      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) welterweight veteran, Jorge Masvidal, used to fight in bare-knuckle boxing matches long before graduating to professional mixed martial arts (MMA), because the idea is to move up in your career and make more money.</p>
      <p>A return to gloveless fighting seems like a step backward at this point in his career.</p>
      <p>But UFC hall of famer, Ken Shamrock, believes that’s the only way to find out just how “bad” Masvidal can be, which is a thinly-veiled attempt to goad “Gamebred” to compete for Valor Fighting Championship, the new bare-knuckle promotion <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/7/11/20690304/ken-shamrock-valor-bare-knuckle-boxing-promotion-promptly-called-out-mark-coleman-mma">founded by Shammy</a>.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we need a belt to tell people there’s a ‘BMF’ – I don’t understand that,” Shamrock told <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/17/20960572/ken-shamrock-invites-jorge-masvidal-to-valor-bare-knuckle-wed-love-to-find-out-how-bad-he-is">MMA Fighting</a>. “Masvidal fought bare knuckle. He did backyard brawls just like (Kimbo Slice). So I say if that’s the case, why doesn’t he try his hand at Valor? We’d love to find out how bad he is.”</p>
      <p>Masvidal was recently crowned “Bad Mother Fucker” after stopping Nate Diaz at UFC 244 earlier this month in New York. It was a bout <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/7/20953342/ufc-ken-shamrock-laughing-wannabe-bmf-fighters-who-compete-once-year-mma">that had Shamrock laughing</a> because it did not come with many of the challenges earlier fighters faced in their careers.</p>
      <p>While that may be true, Masvidal certainly paid his dues after nearly 50 pro fights.</p>
