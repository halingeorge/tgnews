      <p>Pay TV operator Sky Television expects its revenue and earnings to fall after investing in new content, new services and sponsorship deals.</p>
      <p>In a trading update, the company has forecast revenue to drop at least 3 percent this financial year, at between $750 million and $770m from last year's $795m.</p>
      <p>Operating earnings are expected to be down at least 21 percent to between $170m and $190m from the previous year's $241m.</p>
      <p>"As we signalled at our recent annual general meeting and in various reports to the market, the ways that customers want to view content are changing," Sky said.</p>
      <p>"We are focused on delivering our great content to every New Zealander in ways that work for them."</p>
      <p>Accounting changes would also affect its financial result.</p>
      <p>In recent months, Sky has renewed the rights to broadcast the SANZAAR rugby competition, launched a new sport streaming service, and revamped its sports channels, as well a renewing content deals at higher prices.</p>
      <p>It also bought a Dublin-based broadcaster RugbyPass for US$40m, bought the naming rights for Wellington's stadium, and said it planned to sponsor more sporting codes, including more women's teams.</p>
      <p>Sky posted a net loss of $607.8 million in the year to June, after significant write-offs in the value of some assets and scrapping a technology project.</p>
      <p>It would release its first half financial result in February and update shareholders on its transformation strategy.</p>
