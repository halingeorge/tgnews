      <h2>'It is my belief that we are already on the right track with regard to improving the quality of education'</h2>

      <p>An academy in Mansfield has been told it 'requires improvement' by Ofsted inspectors after an inspection found the quality of education and leadership is lacking and needs to improve.</p>
      <p>The Samworth Church Academy in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Sherwood Hall Road</a>, which was previously rated good by the education watchdog, was inspected on October 9 and 10 this year.</p>
      <p>Some of the main issues included the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">curriculum</a>, which was lacking ambition, pupils underachieving and the fact some children were "absent too often", according to the report.</p>
      <p>The school was found to be inclusive and pupils with disabilities and special educational needs were able to access the opportunities available to everyone. However, the report also stated some teachers did not meet the needs of some pupils well enough.</p>
      <p>"Differences are recognised and celebrated," the report says.</p>

      <p>"Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) have the same opportunities as other pupils.</p>
      <p>"They study a wide range of subjects and pupils with SEND enjoy school clubs. For example, some take part in activities such as golf.</p>
      <p>"However, teachers do not meet the needs of pupils with SEND well enough. Some do not achieve as well as they should.</p>
      <p>"Leaders have not ensured that the curriculum is ambitious enough. Some subjects do not meet the requirements of the national curriculum.</p>
      <p>"For example, in English, most pupils study only one Shakespeare text before Key Stage 4. Teachers’ expectations of what pupils can achieve are too low.</p>
      <p>"Pupils do not achieve as well as they should. The curriculum is not coherently planned. Pupils start their GCSE courses in Year 9. Older pupils have not studied a broad and deep curriculum when in Years 7 and 8."</p>
      <p>The inspector also found reading had not improved across the school, with many children saying they did not enjoy reading.</p>
      <p>The report added: "Current approaches to developing reading are ineffective and do not encourage pupils to read for pleasure.</p>
      <p>"Some activities, such as readathons and World Book Day, have a short-term impact on developing pupils’ reading."</p>
      <p>However, while the report said the school required improvement, three other areas - including behaviour, personal development and sixth-form provision - were rated 'good'.</p>
      <p>The inspector said most children felt safe and enjoyed school, while behaviour is good and pupils are polite and considerate.</p>
      <p>Some pupils told the inspectors they felt their confidence had been boosted through activities such as a rendition of The Wizard of Oz.</p>
      <p>The report also explained how the school was ahead of the national picture for character education - including the development of every aspect of every child.</p>
      <p>Principal Lisa McVeigh said: "It is my belief that we are already on the right track with regard to improving the quality of education and, although there is always more work to do, we are already beginning to see the positive impact of changes made in recent months.</p>
      <p>"We are absolutely focused and committed to working hard on the issues identified by our <br/>own staff, as well as by Ofsted, and always in line with the original values and ethos that make this academy so unique.</p>
      <p>"We care passionately about the educational experiences our students receive and we know <br/>that through recent changes we are on the right path to succeed.</p>
      <p>"As always, we will be working relentlessly to continuously improve our students’ experience and outcomes in the very broadest sense."</p>
