      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:57:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>It's been 18 years since Alex McLeish left Hibs to join Rangers and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> has become the 13th permanent manager since.</p>
      <p>And now the former Sunderland boss wants to buck the trend and become the first <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> boss to last three years since Big Eck.</p>
      <p>There's been some successful managers in that time with Tony Mowbray, John Collins, Alan Stubbs and Neil Lennon the best of them but the majority have been major flops.</p>
      <p>The likes of club legend Franck Sauzee, Colin Calderwood, Pat Fenlon, Terry Butcher and the recently axed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> are among them.</p>
      <p>Ross had a similar situation at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> when he became their sixth manager in three years as they tumbled down the leagues.</p>

      <p>The 43-year-old stopped that run and was the longest serving boss since Steve Bruce left in 2011 and intends on doing similar at Hibs after signing a three-and-a-half-year deal at Easter Road.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/">Sky Sports:</a> “That’s part of the attraction for me as well in the early discussions we had, is the want for me to be here for a number of years.</p>
      <p>"I’m not here to use it as a stepping stone or a platform, I want to be a successful Hibs manager and I want to be here for the long term.</p>
      <p>"I suppose my other answer for that is I went to a club where there was a high frequency in changes of managers and I think I was the longest serving since Steve Bruce so I did okay in that respect, I could have been there for longer but certainly the ambition here is to be here for a long period of time."</p>
      <p>Heckingbottom's time in charge had a mixture of poor results and even worse football and Hibs have had a long history of playing some of the best in the country.</p>
      <p>Ross was also criticised for his style at Sunderland and admits that while he hopes to get his side playing good football, results are more important.</p>

      <p>He said: "That's the challenge, you have to win football matches as a manager and as a club. Supporters want that but equally there are demands at certain clubs as well for how you do it.</p>
      <p>"It's not like I'm not familiar with this club I have been here often enough as an opposition player, coach and manager. I've seen some really good sides so it's up to me to make sure I can provide a side that can satisfy the demands of the supporters as well.</p>
      <p>"From the initial conversations with Leeann (Dempster), Graeme (Mathie) and Ron (Gordon), I got a good feel from them and I think that's important. We then progressed to the more formal discussions in terms of what I could offer the club.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of good things in place at this club whether it be the training ground or stadium. There's a lot of good things behind the scenes that people don't see but are very good and very positive but I feel it is a good fit. Ultimately the proof will be in the pudding in terms of what I can produce on the pitch but it felt very natural from very early on."</p>
