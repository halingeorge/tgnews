      <p>British Columbia's Opposition Liberals want seatbelts in all new school buses.</p>
      <p>Liberal member of the legislature Laurie Throness introduced a private member's bill that would require all new school buses in B.C. purchased after 2021 to be equipped with seatbelts.</p>
      <p>Throness cited Transport Canada information from more 25,000 collisions involving school buses in Canada from 1995 to 2004 that resulted in five deaths and more than 3,400 injuries.</p>
      <p>He says the proposed legislation would change B.C.'s Motor Vehicle Act to ensure school buses purchased after September 1, 2021 would be equipped with seatbelts.</p>
      <p>Transportation Minister Claire Trevena says the province is awaiting the results of a federal government report on school bus safety, including seatbelt policy, before making any changes.</p>
      <p>Throness says one of his Chilliwack-area constituents, school bus driver Gary Lillico, started a petition calling for seatbelts in school buses that now has more than 120,000 signatures.</p>
