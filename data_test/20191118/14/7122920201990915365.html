      <h1>Finalists from our Design Challenge are Changing the Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jade Raymond</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://play.google.com/about/changethegame/research/why-we-play/">Research</a> shows that while half of all mobile game players are women, only 23 percent of them think there’s equal treatment and opportunity in the industry. In order to promote women as players and creators, Change The Game empowers the next generation of game makers so all players can feel represented and engaged. </p>
      <p>Our annual <a href="https://play.google.com/about/changethegame/designagame/">Design Challenge</a> encouraged teenagers nationwide to design an original game. We received over 1,500 entries and selected five finalists, who worked with <a href="https://www.girlsmakegames.com/">Girls Make Games</a>. These <a href="https://play.google.com/about/changethegame/designchallenge2019/">winning games</a> are now available <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/topic?id=campaign_editorial_change_the_game_challenge">for download on Google Play</a>.</p>
      <p>Read more about our finalists, their vision, and the inspiration behind their games below:</p>
      <h3>Grand prize winner: Anna, 18 years old, from New York.</h3>
      <p>Anna was inspired to create <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LearnDistrict.Brightlove&amp;utm_source=global_OO&amp;utm_medium=oth&amp;utm_content=Oct2619&amp;utm_campaign=CTG&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-0000000-OO-oth-gm-CTG-Oct2619-Other">Brightlove</a> when she noticed a lack of active intervention by her peers in situations when someone was being bullied or hurt. Brightlove encourages players to be kind and to take action, rather than being mere bystanders. A refreshing contrast to the violence that often permeates mobile games, Brightlove encourages positive actions and rewards kindness.</p>

      <h3>Bridgette, 16 years old, from Washington.</h3>
      <p>Bridgette had been toying with the idea of<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LearnDistrict.Lune&amp;utm_source=global_OO&amp;utm_medium=oth&amp;utm_content=Oct2619&amp;utm_campaign=CTG&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-0000000-OO-oth-gm-CTG-Oct2619-Other"> Lune</a> for quite some time, but Change The Game “gave her the push she needed to bring her thoughts to life.” She wanted to create a game that combined both entertaining mechanics while also telling a powerful narrative. Lune takes place in a distant future where humanity has achieved deep space travel and created sentient AI. The player is prompted to make choices that will dictate her performance, battle options, and ultimately decide her fate.</p>

      <h3>Grace, 15 years old, from Texas.</h3>
      <p>Grace’s interest in game design comes from an unorthodox place. She wasn’t a big gamer growing up. But when she discovered YouTube, she also discovered creators who worked on game development. This inspired her to create games of her own. This particular game idea came to her when she was walking her dog, a miniature poodle named Lucy. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LearnDistrict.GoodDogsBringJoy&amp;utm_source=global_OO&amp;utm_medium=oth&amp;utm_content=Oct2619&amp;utm_campaign=CTG&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-0000000-OO-oth-gm-CTG-Oct2619-Other">Good Dogs Bring Joy</a> flips the virtual pet game idea on its head. The user plays as a dog named Alex who wants to help their owner to collect information about the world. What will they sniff up together?</p>

      <h3>Krista, 18 years old, from New Hampshire.</h3>
      <p>Krista has always been fascinated by games that have a relatable and personable story to follow. With Spectrum, Krista wanted to capture a feeling of love and belonging, as well as the ability to do something about the various situations life throws at you. Fun fact: Spectrum evolved from doodles and sketches, with little notes in the margins. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LearnDistrict.Spectrum&amp;utm_source=global_OO&amp;utm_medium=oth&amp;utm_content=Oct2619&amp;utm_campaign=CTG&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-0000000-OO-oth-gm-CTG-Oct2619-Other">Spectrum</a> is a 2D platformer fantasy game in which “sprites” small pixie-like creatures, are taking over the bodies of other creatures on Earth, controlling their actions and powers.</p>

      <h3>Neha, 15 years old, from California.</h3>
      <p>Neha was watching a show about the vastness of the universe at a planetarium when she was struck with the idea of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LearnDistrict.YuMe&amp;utm_source=global_OO&amp;utm_medium=oth&amp;utm_content=Oct2619&amp;utm_campaign=CTG&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-0000000-OO-oth-gm-CTG-Oct2619-Other">YuMe</a>. Living in a society caught up with differences and judgement, Neha was inspired to focus on similarities and how we can all belong as one. The word “yume” in Japanese means dream, and the game name, YuMe, is a play on the word which combines the English words “You” and “Me.” The title expresses that the character’s dream is for “you and me” to meet.</p>
