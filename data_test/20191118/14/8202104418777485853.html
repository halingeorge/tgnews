      <p>Tyrone Nontell's sister says her brother sought in-patient addiction treatment months before he killed Tyrell George Bird, a father of two. Nontell ended up an out patient and didn't continue.</p>

      <h3>Tyrone Nontell’s family believe that if he had been accepted into an in-patient addictions treatment program, he may not have fatally shot Tyrell George Bird last June in Prince Albert.</h3>
      <p>Nontell, 33, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for manslaughter on Oct. 29 in Prince Albert Court of Queen’s Bench in connection with Bird’s 2018 death. The sentence followed a joint submission by the Crown and defence and included a 576-day credit for time already served on remand.</p>

      <p>Bird was shot at the end of June and remained on life support for days until he died on July 2, 2018. Prince Albert police identified Nontell as the suspect and issued a warrant for his arrest on a second-degree murder charge that September. He was arrested in October.</p>
      <p>Bird’s sister, Shae-Lynn Bear, doesn’t feel the sentence is long enough. Her family, especially her brother’s children, who are four and five years old, will be living with his death for much longer than 15 years, she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s not going to go away.”</p>
      <p>Bear feels her brother’s death didn’t have to happen. She said he was shot over a very small amount of money — $300.</p>
      <p>Nontell’s sister, Shelly Laliberte, also feels it should not have happened. She and their mother believe things would have been different if Nontell had been in an in-patient addictions treatment program, she said.</p>
      <p>“He was completely willing to get help. He knew he needed help and he knew he couldn’t do it by himself. And I really do think all this could have been prevented by that.”</p>
      <p>She began to notice the signs that something wasn’t right with her brother months before the shooting, she said. Family members’ belongings began to go missing in December 2017 and January 2018, and she suspected her brother. She called him out on it, believing he had an addiction, but he kept denying it, she said.</p>

      <p>On her birthday that March, Nontell told her he had an addiction.</p>
      <p>“I was driving him somewhere and he was really quiet and not saying anything, which was weird for him. So I asked him what’s wrong and he said ‘I think I need help,’ ” Laliberte said.</p>
      <p>She believes her brother became addicted to cocaine after he met his then-girlfriend. Before, he was fun to be around and an “awesome” person, she said. To her children, he was “uncle Noni.”</p>
      <p>In the car, she asked Nontell what kind of help he wanted and he said he’d feel safer in in-patient treatment and he didn’t trust himself to follow through with an out-patient program, she said.</p>
      <p>Laliberte called the Metis Addictions Council of Saskatchewan in Prince Albert to set up a meeting for her brother to be assessed for in-patient care in Saskatoon. She accompanied him to the meeting in Prince Albert and he was put in outpatient treatment instead, she said.</p>
      <p>He didn’t end up continuing with the out-patient program.</p>
      <p>In an email to The StarPhoenix, MACSI’s executive director, Raymond Laliberte, said the organization can’t comment on any specific case or provide general comments regarding its policy, processes and procedures at this time because “doing so could reasonably link to the individual in question and result in a breach of confidentiality and privacy.”</p>
      <p><a href="http://macsi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Complete-Intake-Package-with-Guide.pdf">MACSI uses the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health’s primary assessment interview guide, which is included on its website.</a> It has 43 beds in three locations — 15 in Saskatoon, 12 in Regina and 16 in Prince Albert. In-patient clients are in residential treatment for 28 days, receive counselling, participate in workshops, and take part in educational, recreational and cultural programming.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://macsi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FINAL-Annual-Report_2018-2019.pdf">The Prince Albert and Saskatoon centres were both noted as being busy in MACSI’s 2018-2019 annual report; the Prince Albert centre was described as MACSI’s busiest. </a>
      </p>
      <p>Information specific to the criteria used to determine whether someone should be admitted to in-patient treatment is not available on the website.</p>
      <p>Nontell’s sentence was on the higher end for a manslaughter charge, Crown prosecutor Kristen Hubbard told The StarPhoenix. Although both sides agreed the shooting was a “gang-fuelled” incident, the Crown didn’t allege Nontell was a part of a gang. Rather, he was associated to some extent and was selling drugs, factors Hubbard said fuelled the incident.</p>
      <p>On behalf of Bird’s family, a victims’ services worker read into the court record an impact statement they wrote, Hubbard said.</p>
      <p>Bear said going to university — something her brother encouraged her to do  — and watching his kids grow up has helped her start healing.</p>
      <p>She knows her brother had been involved in a gang, but wants others to know there was more to him, she said. She described him as a funny, smart and talented man who sang to his daughters.</p>
      <p>“He just grew up differently, he just did what he knew,” she said.</p>
