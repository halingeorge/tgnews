        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a> worked his friendly charm on Ms Banks over the weekend when they met at London’s Royal Albert Hall.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Duke of Sussex made an appearance at the OnSide Youth Zones awards show on Sunday night, where Ms Banks happened to be performing.</p>
      <p>Lucky for the British rapper, Harry had enough time to drop in backstage and it looked as though they got on like a house on fire.</p>
      <p>In their photo, Harry, 35, looks happy and relaxed while posing next to Ms Banks who jokingly captioned the image: ‘I met Prince Harry today you know he’s one of us lol.’</p>
      <p>She also included the face emoji with love hearts so it’s safe to say the prince left her well and truly swooning.</p>
      <p>During the awards show, Harry delivered a speech addressing mental health while presenting the health and wellbeing award.</p>

      <p>Praising Greta Thunberg, 16, for bravely campaigning for action on climate change, the Duke said: ‘She may have been just one person at the beginning, but she had a belief, a mission, and a desire to do something not just for herself but for everyone, and now – the whole world is paying attention.</p>

      <p>‘Whatever your dream – every country, every community, every school, every friendship group, every family needs their own Greta – someone who can lead the way, someone who is prepared to stand up for what they believe, and show how much they care for the people in their lives and the community around them.’</p>
      <p>It’s no surprise Harry looked so relaxed as it was his last engagement before now starting an extended break with his wife, Meghan Markle, and baby son Archie.</p>
      <p>Reports say Harry and Meghan will begin their six-week break by flying out to the US to visit Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland in California, where they could spend Thanksgiving on 28 November.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ms Banks is busy supporting grime legend Giggs on his UK tour which head to Bi Nuu in Berlin, Germany tonight.</p>
