      <h2>Who are the candidates in Sutton Coldfield for the 2019 general election?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:01:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker, https://www.facebook.com/JonWalkerPolitics?pnref=story</a></address>
      <p>Sutton Coldfield is a safe Conservative seat. Former MPs include Norman Fowler, now Lord Fowler, who plays an important role in Parliament as Lords Speaker.</p>
      <p>While Sutton is once again widely known as the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, the title is not part of the official name of the constituency. It's also unusual because it's the only Birmingham constituency that doesn't have the word Birmingham in its name.</p>
      <p>Sutton Coldfield is relatively wealthy, with low levels of unemployment.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party has said it will not stand candidates in seats which Conservatives are defending. That means it does not have a candidate in Sutton Coldfield.</p>

      <p>Ben Auton - Green Party</p>
      <p>David Knowles - Labour Party</p>
