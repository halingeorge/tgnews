      <h1>Redditor's attempt to take photo with her dog goes wonderfully wrong</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:53:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/sam-haysom/" target="_blank">Sam Haysom</a></address>
      <p>Nine times out of 10, any attempt to take a photo with a canine companion will end in nothing but a blurry mess.</p>
      <p>But every once in a while, you strike gold.</p>
      <p>"Attempted to take a cute picture of me and my dog," wrote 33-year-old Reddit user Casey. "This was the result."</p>
      <p>Behold, photo perfection:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/dxw41t/attempted_to_take_a_cute_picture_of_me_and_my_dog/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Attempted to take a cute picture of me and my dog. This was the result.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/">funny</a></blockquote>
      <p>That photo has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/dxw41t/attempted_to_take_a_cute_picture_of_me_and_my_dog/">gone viral in the r/funny subreddit</a>, where it currently has over 32,000 upvotes. It's beautifully reminiscent of an old viral trend known as <a href="https://mashable.com/2013/05/22/cat-beards/">cat bearding</a>, which was popular back in 2013.</p>
      <p>In case you were wondering, the dog in that picture is a miniature dachshund. His name is Bosco, but he also goes by Beans. And he takes a wonderful, wonderful photo.</p>
      <p>As Casey wrote in the comments, that's the holiday cards sorted.</p>
