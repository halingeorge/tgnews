      <p>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A jury in Iowa has awarded $1.4 million to a Burmese immigrant who wanted a circumcision but instead got a vasectomy.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/">The Des Moines Register</a> reports that the jury last week leveled a $2 million judgment against Dr. Kevin Birusingh, who performed the vasectomy.</p>
      <p>But jurors decided the man who filed the lawsuit, Zaw Zaw, was 30% responsible.</p>
      <p>Zaw is a 41-year-old refugee from Myanmar. He sued in November 2017, nearly two years after the errant procedure.</p>
      <p>Birusingh's attorney says Zaw, who is not fluent in English, signed two informed consents that were translated into Burmese, and completed four consultations before undergoing the procedure.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit says there's no word for "vasectomy" in Burmese.</p>
      <p>Zaw's attorney, Marc Harding, says a doctor's referral documents showed Zaw was seeking a circumcision.</p>
