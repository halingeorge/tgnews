      <p>A 50-year-old man accused of a multi-million pound investment fraud is to be banned from running any new schemes, a High Court judge ordered yesterday.</p>
      <p>The prohibition was imposed on Paul Dougan as he was granted bail on charges linked to a renewable energy initiative with more than 130 alleged victims - many of whom are from Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Mrs Justice Keegan said: "I don't think he should be involved in any investment type business, the public need to be protected."</p>
      <p>Dougan, of Hughenden Gardens in Glasgow, faces a total of 147 charges.</p>
      <p>They include 136 counts of fraud by false representation, and making a mini-bond invitation document for use in connection with fraud.</p>
      <p>He is further accused of acquiring, concealing and entering an arrangement to acquire criminal property.</p>
      <p>Dougan was arrested last month by detectives from the PSNI's economic crime unit investigating alleged offences covering period between 2011 and 2016.</p>
      <p>The probe involves investments and property arrangements worth up to Â£8 million in total.</p>
      <p>A previous court was told funds were paid into a renewable energy bond scheme allegedly run by Dougan.</p>
      <p>It was further claimed that a number of properties in Co Tyrone and Co Donegal were transferred over to a company under the defendant's control.</p>
      <p>According to the prosecution Dougan has connections to Saudi Arabia, South America and Gibraltar, where a yacht for hire was said to be moored.</p>
      <p>He mounted a fresh application for bail after obtaining a new address in Larne, Co Antrim.</p>
      <p>The court heard all of his assets have been restrained as part of the ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>With another suspect currently reporting to police on a voluntary basis, Mrs Justice Keegan decided Dougan can be released from custody under strict terms.</p>
      <p>She stressed: "He must not recruit or deal with any investment scheme, I want that made clear."</p>
