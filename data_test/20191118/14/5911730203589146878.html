      <h1>Trump tweets that he is 'strongly' considering testifying in impeachment hearings</h1>
      <h2>Administration had said it would not cooperate</h2>

      <p>President Donald Trump tweeted Monday that he would "strongly consider" testifying in impeachment inquiry proceedings — either in writing or in person.</p>
      <p>Trump's tweet came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested in a CBS "Face the Nation" interview Sunday that Trump testify.</p>
      <p>"Our Crazy, Do Nothing (where's USMCA, infrastructure, lower drug pricing &amp; much more?) Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they &amp; Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sunday's DEFACE THE NATION.... ....that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt. She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don't like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!" Trump tweeted Monday.</p>
      <p>Testimony by Trump would be an about-face for the administration, which has previously said it would not cooperate with the Democrat-led impeachment proceedings.</p>
      <p>Public impeachment inquiry hearings will resume Tuesday, when Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman and Kurt D. Volker will appear before the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
