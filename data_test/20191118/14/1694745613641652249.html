      <p>It's been a while since <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Lucy-Liu-Hollywood-Walk-Fame-Ceremony-Pictures-46097079">three angels bid Charlie good morning</a>, but the Townsend Agency is back and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Charlie-Angels-Reboot-Details-2018-45003822">sporting a whole new look</a>! The new trailer for the highly anticipated relaunch of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Charlie%E2%80%99s-Angels"><b>Charlie's Angels</b></a> is here and fans get a good look at <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Elizabeth-Banks-Charlie-Angels-Interview-EW-2019-46021811">the new elite crime-fighting team</a>, ready to kick ass and save the world.</p>
      <p>Featuring <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Ariana-Grande-Miley-Cryus-Lana-Del-Rey-Charlie-Angels-Song-46320660">an incredibly catchy jam</a> by Ariana Grande, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Miley-Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, and Lana Del Rey, the action-packed footage introduces fans to the wild Sabina Wilson (played by a surprisingly humorous <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kristen-Stewart">Kristen Stewart</a>), former spy Jane Kano (played by big-screen newcomer Ella Balinska), and young systems engineer Elena Houghlin (<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Aladdin"><b>Aladdin</b></a>'s Naomi Scott). While the three don't start out as a badass team of ass-kickers — in fact, Sabina and Jane are assigned to work on a case involving Elena — they're thwarting evil villains in the badass fashion we expect from <b>Charlie's Angels</b> in no time. Elizabeth Banks (who also serves as the franchise's first female director), Patrick Stewart, Sam Claflin, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Djimon-Hounsou">Djimon Hounsou</a>, Jonathan Tucker, Luis Gerardo Méndez, and Noah Centineo round out the rest of the film's <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Charlie-Angels-Reboot-Cast-45336532">star-studded cast</a>, and they all make appearances in the trailer.</p>
      <p>The footage also highlights two of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Elizabeth-Banks-Talks-Feminism-New-Charlies-Angels-Movie-46335086">the biggest changes</a> from the previous <b>Charlie's Angels</b> installments: the Townsend agency has expanded into an international organization and "Bosley" is now a rank within the organization, rather than a surname. Check out the latest trailer above for more looks at the franchise's newest release, and get ready to dive into the action when <b>Charlie's Angels</b> hits theaters on Nov. 15.</p>
