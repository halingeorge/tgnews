      <p>A 16-year-old boy admitted to murdering his girlfriend, 13, hours after her mother discovered her shot dead in her yard, police say.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Savannah, Georgia said Jeremiah Seaton walked into their police department and confessed to killing his girlfriend, Meya Mitchell, on Friday.</p>
      <p>Mitchell’s mother, April Jones, said she found her daughter on the night she was killed.</p>
      <p>Jones told <a href="https://www.wjcl.com/article/i-will-never-see-my-child-mother-of-13-year-old-killed-in-shooting-speaks/29824551">WJCL</a>: ‘In that moment I saw my child, laying in her own yard. That is a sight I will never unsee.’</p>
      <p>The Savannah Police Department wrote: ‘Around 8:40 p.m. Jeremiah Seaton, 16, arrived at Central Precinct to report that he had shot his girlfriend on Seminole Street.’</p>

      <p>Seaton faces one count of murder although it is unclear if he was charged as an adult.</p>
      <p>‘I will never see my child. All I got is memories, and pictures,’ Jones said.</p>
      <p>‘There’s nothing for this person (Seaton) to say to make me forgive him, and make me understand how he played God and took my child,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>Jones said her older daughter’s 18th birthday was on Sunday, a day that her family ended up celebrating one life while mourning the death of another.</p>
      <p>‘(Meya) loved to dance, she liked making clothes, you know, she liked to sing. She was a fun child. She was an outgoing child,’ Jones said.</p>
      <p>A makeshift memorial for Meya made up of pink candles, flowers, and balloons was placed in Jones’s front driveway where family members payed their respects over the weekend, according to WJCL.</p>
      <p>The Savannah Police department said the investigation remains active and ongoing.</p>
