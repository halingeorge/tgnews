      <p>UK multi-instrumentalist John Holden will release his new album, <i>Rise And Fall</i>, on February 29.</p>
      <p>“I was delighted with the response to the first album and that gave me a lot of confidence," Holden tells <i>Prog</i>. "I believe these new compositions are even stronger and I am excited to see what reaction this album receives”</p>
      <p><i>Rise And Fall</i> features a host of guest performances including Oliver Wakeman, Nick D'Virgilio, former Renaissance bassist Jon Camp, Billy Sherwood, Mystery guitarist Michel St. Perre, Peter Jones, Joe Payne, Sally Minnear and more</p>
      <p>“There are plenty of familiar faces making a return plus some amazing new talent. Everyone has added something unique and special," says Holden. “There are diverse topics ranging from cultural terrorism, enduring love, political commentary, addictions and even a flying monk! There are however recurring musical themes and lyrical ideas throughout and it feels very cohesive”, says Holden.</p>
      <p>The full track listing is:</p>
      <p>Leap of Faith<br/>Rise and Fall<br/>The Golden Thread<br/>Dark Arts<br/>Heretic<br/>After the Storm<br/>Ancestors and Satellites</p>
