      <p>The USD/JPY pair quickly retreated around 30-35 pips in the last hour and is currently placed near the lower end of its daily trading range, around the 108.75-70 region.<br/> <br/>The pair once again failed to find acceptance above the very important 200-day SMA and turned sharply lower in reaction to an intraday turnaround in the global risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> amid not so positive US-China trade headlines.</p>
      <h3>Focus remains on trade developments</h3>
      <p>As reported by CNBC's Beijing correspondent Eunice Yoon, citing a government source, the mood in China about trade deal is pessimistic, especially after the US President Donald Trump denied to rollback tariffs.<br/> <br/>The report dampened investors' appetite for perceived riskier assets and was evident from a drop in equity markets, which provided a strong boost to the Japanese yen's perceived safe-haven status and exerted some pressure.<br/> <br/>The global flight to safety was further reinforced by a weaker tone surrounding the US Treasury bond yields, which undermined demand for the US Dollar and further collaborated to the pair's latest leg of a downfall.<br/> <br/>It will now be interesting to see if the current pullback marks the resumption of the recent bearish trend or is still looked upon as a buying opportunity amid absent relevant market-moving economic releases on Monday.</p>
