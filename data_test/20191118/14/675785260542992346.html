      <p>The extent of the injury Richard Keogh suffered during the Derby County drink-drive smash has been shown for the first time.</p>
      <p>Defender Keogh, 33, could be out of action for more than a year after he seriously damaged his anterior cruciate ligament during a night out with team-mates Tom Lawrence and Mason Bennett in September.</p>
      <p>The Irishman, who was the Rams' club captain, was a unbelted passenger in a Range Rover which was being driven by Lawrence as it crashed into a lamp post.</p>
      <p>Derby sacked Keogh last month following a disciplinary hearing into the episode which found him guilty of gross misconduct.</p>

      <p>The PFA have vowed to stand by him, saying: "We will robustly defend our member because we feel he has been unfairly treated."</p>
      <p>Keogh, who has been seen at Derby matches with crutches, spent the international break with his Ireland team-mates.</p>
      <p>The centre-back travelled over to his homeland to continue his rehabilitation at the FAI headquarters.</p>
      <p>Keogh was pictured on an exercise bike as he attempted to get strength back into his leg knee, while joking around with Shane Duffy and David McGoldrick.</p>

      <p>Ireland face Denmark in a crunch Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday night - with Martin O'Neill's men needing to either win by two goals to confirm their place in next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>Lawrence and Bennett avoided jail terms and have not been dismissed by Derby for their part in the incident.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Keogh hasn't publicly commented on the crash or his injury, his wife posted the message: “Wife to a professional scapegoat,” after he was let go.</p>
      <p>Agent Cos Toffis, who represents Keogh, added to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10278783/richard-keogh-derby-sacking-can-of-worms/">the Sun</a> : "I think it could be quite a big can of worms.</p>
      <p>"If this goes in Derby's favour there will be a lot of players in difficult positions at their football clubs.</p>
      <p>"Older players with less market value who are on a lot of money, these are scenarios you have at every football club in the world.</p>
      <p>"Should they start wrapping themselves up in cotton wool to avoid any situations like this?"</p>
