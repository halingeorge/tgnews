      <p>The Festival of Trees returns to West Kelowna's Mission Hill Family Estate Winery on Friday for a third year of holiday celebrations and fundraising.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bcchf.ca/festival-of-trees">The celebration</a> occurs in communities around B.C., and all proceeds from the event at Mission Hill will benefit the BC Children's Hospital Foundation.</p>
      <p>Attendees can expect a decorated forest of trees, and visitors will also have the ability to vote on their favourite, through donations to the hospital.</p>
      <p>The event begins with an open house from 5 to 9 p.m., with a minimum donation of $2, and will run until Jan. 4.</p>
      <p>Attendees can enjoy mulled wine, hot chocolate, food stations, entertainment, Santa photos and more.</p>
      <p>“Mission Hill Family Estate is thrilled and honoured to once again host Kelowna’s Festival of Trees,” said spokesman Darryl Brooker.</p>
      <p>“The life-saving work performed every day at BC Children’s Hospital is an evergreen cause that has benefitted countless families across the province. Everyone at Mission Hill looks forward to celebrating the season with our guests, and once again bringing attention and much-needed funds to the festival’s incredible beneficiary.”</p>
