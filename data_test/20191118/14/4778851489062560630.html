        <b>Building work has officially begun to create a new distillery on the banks of the Forth and Clyde canal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The multi-million-pound restoration of the Rosebank distillery, which is being carried out by ISG, is expected to be completed in summer 2021.</p>

      <p>Situated between Edinburgh and Glasgow, Rosebank has been dormant for 25 years. It ceased production when former owner UDV – now Diageo – mothballed the site and its maltings were converted into a restaurant.</p>
      <p>In January, new owner Ian Macleod Distillers was granted permission to revive the distillery and has since been putting plans in place to breathe new life into the grounds.</p>
      <p>Mike Younger, finance director of Ian Macleod Distillers, said: “This ground-break is a milestone – it marks the start of a new and exciting chapter for both Rosebank and Ian Macleod Distillers.</p>
      <p>“Our vision was to bring this quintessential Lowland single malt back to life and ensure it could live on for generations to come. A dream that is now very much underway.”</p>
      <p>The iconic 108-foot chimney stack, which has become an instantly recognisable landmark in Falkirk, will remain right in the middle, connecting Rosebank’s past with its future, the distiller added.</p>
