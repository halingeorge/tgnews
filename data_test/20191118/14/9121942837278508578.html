      <p>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Relatives of those killed in a Colombia massacre are putting their loved ones to rest nearly two decades after the attack – while also warning the government hasn’t done enough to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again.</p>
      <p>Family members held a ceremony Monday in the town of Bojayá following a painstaking process in which scientists used DNA to identify the remains of 79 people initially buried in a mass grave.</p>
      <p>Relatives were handed small coffins holding the remains for burial.</p>
      <p>Rev. Esterling Mena told family members the new burial is important because it means those killed will no longer be interred in a place “chosen by war.”</p>
      <p>People were sheltering in a church as leftist rebels clashed with paramilitaries in 2002, and a mortar shell exploded inside, killing dozens.</p>
