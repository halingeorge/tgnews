      <p>We are pleased to announce that Lisk (LSK) will be listed on Kraken starting November 19.</p>
      <p><b>What is Lisk </b>(<b>LSK)?</b></p>
      <p>
        <i>Lisk is an open source blockchain, powered by a native utility token called LSK, that is focused on accessibility. Lisk allows developers to program in JavaScript, one of the most robust and popular coding languages in the world, allowing those unfamiliar with blockchain technology to build applications on the network. </i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lisk employs a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus model – transactions are added by a revolving list of 101 delegates, who are elected by LSK token holders.</li>
        <li>Lisk utilizes a native utility token called LSK. The token is used to perform various functions on the platform, such as utilizing dapps or voting for delegates. </li>
        <li>Each new dapp is placed on a Lisk sidechain, which is connected to the main Lisk network. This structure provides throughput efficiencies and also allows developers to create native tokens for their applications.</li>
        <li>A new block is added to the network every 10 seconds and the default fee to send a transaction is 0.1 LSK ($.07)</li>
        <li>Lisk was founded in early 2016 by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows; it is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland</li>
        <li>Project website: <a href="https://lisk.io/">https://lisk.io/</a></li>

        <b>Will Kraken list more assets?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch – not even about which assets we are considering. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be listing in the future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Trade with caution</b>
      </p>
      <p>Limit orders are recommended when trading starts since the markets may be illiquid initially. Be extremely careful with market orders and orders that trigger market orders (e.g. stop loss).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Invest with caution</b>
      </p>
      <p>Listing an asset or token for trade is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or participate in the associated network. Do your own research and invest at your own risk.</p>
