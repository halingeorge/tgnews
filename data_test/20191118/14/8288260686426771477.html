      <p>Two parents have been branded "peak stupid" after giving their daughter a "blended" surname.</p>
      <p>The mum and dad's decision to combine their last names to create their daughter's surname has been slammed.</p>
      <p>But, remarkably, not everybody has been left open-mouthed by their decision.</p>
      <p>In fact, some others think the moniker is "lovely" - yes really.</p>
      <p>Parents Courtney and Laura decided they wanted to give their little girl Lyla a combination of both of their surnames, Cassar and Sheldon, to give her the last name 'Casseldon', reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/parents-labelled-peak-stupid-after-20907385">Mirror</a> .</p>

      <p>Explaining how they love the modern moniker, Courtney said:  "I like the idea of our daughter having a part of both of us," as reported by the  <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=DTWEB_WRE170_a_NEW&amp;dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnews%2Fnsw%2Faussie-parents-giving-their-newborns-blended-last-names%2Fnews-story%2Fdac6c5f3946e2b2bfe45c73f21a67271&amp;memtype=anonymous&amp;mode=premium&amp;nk=2ad28540fa0fc37885573d7e541f28f7-1574085132">Daily Telegraph</a>  .</p>
      <p>“With hyphens (double barrel surnames) I find a lot of kids end up choosing one name because it is easier.</p>
      <p>“We played around with a few last names and found one that we like and sounds like a last name.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The move split opinion online, which varied from those who thought it was 'lovely' to others who said it was 'ridiculous'.</p>
      <p>One said: “This is peak stupid.”</p>
      <p>Another replied: “Family trees are going to get much harder in the future."</p>
      <p>A third defended the decision, arguing: "It's the parents right to name their children anything they like."</p>
