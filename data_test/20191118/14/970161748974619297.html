      <p>It’s been a tough year (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>, we’re looking at you) but that’s all the more reason to celebrate the end of 2019 in style.</p>
      <p>From the decadent and expensive to the affordable and quirky, there’s something for everyone.</p>
      <p>We know you’re probably busy planning for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christmas/">Christmas</a> right now, but the best parties sell out quickly.</p>
      <p>To help you on your way, we’ve put together a list of our five favourite events (and one of them costs as little as £3 per person).</p>
      <h3>The quirky one</h3>

      <p>Do you dream of celebrating New Year’s Eve in Times Square, while watching the infamous ball drop at midnight?</p>
      <p>This party may well be the second best thing, hosted this side of the pond.</p>
      <p>Battersea Evolution, the event venue in the middle of Battersea Park, will be transformed into a NYC mecca, complete with a fake subway and a yellow cab parked in the middle of the room.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The fun starts from the moment you walk through the private entrance, decorated with snow-topped trees and twinkling lights, as bell hops guide you through the lobby.</p>
      <p>Don’t be surprised if you smell roasted chestnuts in the air.</p>
      <p>As for the entertainment, there will be a 12ft circular stage with acts performing throughout the night, as well as a DJ on the decks.</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> Battersea Evolution, Battersea Park</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.designmynight.com/london/whats-on/food-drink/the-london-new-years-eve-ball-1">Ticket price</a>: </b>£190 (includes unlimited house wine, beer, cider and soft drinks)</p>
      <h3>The luxurious one</h3>

      <p>Be prepared to splash the cash if you want to celebrate at Sky Bar, but rest assured – it’s worth it.</p>
      <p>The party is hosted across two floors with different themes.</p>
      <p>Don your finest, glittering outfit as you head to the 28th floor, where it’s ‘Cabaret Extravaganza’, with a spin on Moulin Rouge, featuring ‘seductive burlesque showgirls’ and a ‘cheeky boylesque performer’.</p>
      <p>On the 29th floor, enjoy ‘Decadence Defined’ with food stalls serving luxury dishes and three bars with unlimited booze flowing throughout the night (included in the ticket price).</p>
      <p>At midnight, ring in the New Year on the outdoor heated viewing platform, while sipping on complimentary Dom Perignon and getting a prime view of the capital’s fireworks.</p>
      <p>The party will run for 12 hours, starting at 6pm, but if you need a break, there’s a 300-seat cinema at your disposal with complimentary truffle popcorn.</p>
      <p>Each guest will also get a survival kit goodie bag for the dreaded New Year’s Day hangover.</p>

      <h3>The fancy dress one</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>True to its 1920s theme, The Candlelight Club pop-up party will be held in a secret location in Central London.</p>
      <p>It will be a low-key but busy evening, complete with live jazz music, cabaret variety shows, burlesque, acrobatics and fortune tellers.</p>
      <p>The venue will also be completely lit by candles, so you can loosen those inhibitions.</p>
      <p>Sure, your flapper dress might catch on fire, but what’s a speakeasy visit without some potential danger?</p>
      <p>Get a cheap entry ticket for drinks and dancing or add on a three-course menu for a few extra pounds. You can also reserve a table if you’re going with a big group.</p>
      <p>Gatsby would approve.</p>

        <figcaption>The boozer is hosting a ‘house party of epic proportions’ (Picture: Design My Night/The Star of Bethnal Green</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>New Year’s Eve is known for being one of the most expensive nights of the year, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
      <p>If you’re not bothered about the glitz and glam, and just want a really good night out in a decent venue with a ticket price that won’t have you eating noodles all of January, here you go.</p>
      <p>The Star of Bethnal Green is transforming itself from local boozer to a ‘house party of epic proportions’ with ‘booze, beds, beer baths and kitchen seshes’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Dubbed, ‘New Year, Who Dis?’, the bar will be stocked with nostalgic drinks to take you back to your student years with Smirnoff Ice, Hooch and WKD blue on offer.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile U OK HUN? drag trash queens will supply the tunes.</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> The Star of Bethnal Green, Bethnal Green</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.designmynight.com/london/pubs/bethnal-green/the-star-of-bethnal-green/new-year-who-dis">Ticket price</a>: </b>£3-£10</p>
      <h3>The cool one</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Ever dreamed of roaming a museum at night? Here’s your chance.</p>
      <p>The theme for the National History Museum’s bash in 2019 is ‘Creatures of the Night’, with ‘wild activities’ planned for party-goers.</p>
      <p>Make nocturnal animal masks and explore the galleries while you sip on cocktails, break out the moves on the dance floor to a Massaoke band and listen to the DJ spin tunes all night long.</p>
      <p>You could also play musical bingo or cover yourself in UV body paint and dance under the huge, man-made moon in the silent disco room.</p>
      <p><b>Where: </b>The Natural History Museum, South Kensington</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/new-years-eve-creatures-night.html">Ticket price</a>: </b>£99, with concessions for members (£89)</p>

        <figcaption>Less rave, more classy drinks night (Picture: Mr Fogg’s Residence)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If an all-night rave doesn’t appeal, why not indulge in sumptuous cocktails at a decadent gin parlour?</p>
      <p>It’ll still be a party, but the kind where you won’t be rolling around on the floor at midnight.</p>
      <p>Have two Hendrick’s gin cocktails – included in the ticket price – dig into some petits fours and let yourself be entertained by the venue’s very own magician.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>At midnight, guests are treated to a complimentary glass of Moët &amp; Chandon champagne.</p>
      <p>Once you’re feeling merry and more inclined to let loose, you could always pop downstairs and continue the party in Fanny &amp; Fogg’s.</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> Mr Fogg’s Gin Parlour, Covent Garden</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.designmynight.com/london/whats-on/new-years-eve-party/new-year-new-be-gin-nings">Ticket price</a>: </b>£55</p>
