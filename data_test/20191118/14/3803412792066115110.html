        <li>Launch the <b>Logi Circle Security Camera</b> app.</li>
        <li>Tap on the <b>Menu</b> button on the top left of your camera feed.</li>
        <li>Scroll down and tap on <b>Smart Home Integrations</b>. <i>Source: iMore</i></li>
        <li>Choose <b>Apple HomeKit</b>. You may see a prompt asking you to allow access to your Home if you haven't given this permission previously. You will need to allow access to proceed.</li>
        <li>Tap on <b>Beta: Convert to support HomeKit Secure Video</b>. <i>Source: iMore</i></li>
        <li>Thoroughly read the warnings about the conversion process, then tap on each of the <b>Checkboxes</b> to indicate that you accept and understand, then tap <b>Upgrade</b>. This process will remove your ability to use your camera with the Logi Circle app and will delete any recordings that you may have made with the Circle Safe subscription service, so be sure to back them up before proceeding.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Continue</b> once your upgrade is complete. <i>Source: iMore</i></li>
        <li>Select <b>Remove Camera Now</b> or <b>Remove Camera Later</b> accordingly.</li>
        <li>Tap on <b>OK</b> if you chose to remove your camera from the app to finish. <i>Source: iMore</i></li>
      </ol>
      <p>That's it! Your camera is now using HomeKit Secure Video for all of its recordings and video feeds. From now on, all of your camera's settings will be available in the Home app, such as toggling night vision, and a new timeline will be shown while viewing your camera that shows off all of your recordings.</p>
      <p>Advanced options like setting what type of motion events send notifications also reside in the Home app, which takes advantage of image analysis to determine if a car, animal, or person is passing by. With everything moved over to the Home app, you can now delete the Circle 2 app, as it can no longer be used with your camera unless you decide to downgrade, which will involve a call to Logitech's support line.</p>
      <h4>Awesome accessories</h4>
      <p>The Logitech Circle 2 Camera isn't just the first camera to support HomeKit Secure Video.

This camera also works both indoors and out, and it has access to a variety of mounting options making it truly flexible.
