      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdpd">Bose QuietComfort 35</a> (Series II) wireless headphones are on sale for £249 on Amazon, saving you up to 25% on list price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Amazon's "Countdown to Black Friday Sale" is already throwing a few surprises out there, and we're not ashamed to admit that we didn't see this one coming.</p>
      <p><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdpd">Bose QuietComfort 35</a> (Series II) wireless headphones are now on sale for just <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdpd">£249 on Amazon</a>. These are normally listed at £329.95, meaning you could save over £80 with this deal. This might not sound like the most amazing deal you've ever come across, but discounts on these headphones are so rare.</p>
      <p>The list of reasons why the Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones are so popular, and go on sale so infrequently, is long. For starters, you get three levels of noise cancellation, balanced audio performance, Bluetooth pairing, and smart connectivity. There is a lot more, but we haven't got all day.</p>
      <p>Pick up this rare deal in the "Countdown to Black Friday Sale," and start this busy shopping period with a great bargain.</p>
