        <b>Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen has praised his Tottenham teammate Troy Parrott as the two prepare to do battle in tonight’s crucial Euro 2020 qualifier at the Aviva Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parrott won his first cap for the Irish senior team in the 3-1 victory against New Zealand last week and despite not finding the net, the 17-year-old looked comfortable leading the line for the Boys in Green.</p>
      <p>The Spurs striker has been named in the 23-man squad by <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/mick-mccarthy-keen-to-surprise-doubters-with-win-over-denmark/">Mick McCarthy</a> for Monday’s battle with Denmark, who will be hoping Parrott’s North London teammate Eriksen can be their key man in Dublin once again.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old scored a hat-trick when Denmark defeated Ireland in the World Cup 2018 play-off two years ago but before Monday’s crunch clash, Eriksen took the time to praise the qualities of Parrott who he compared to England’s Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>“If he’s going to beat Harry Kane [for a starting spot with Spurs] then it’s going to be tough,” <a href="https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2019/1117/1092486-eriksen-on-troy-parrott-spurs-ireland-denmark/">Eriksen said in quotes reported by RTÉ.</a></p>
      <p>“But, no, he’s done very well. He’s trained with us for a while now and he played a few games in the pre-season.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good player. I wouldn’t say it’s fair to say he’s like Harry Kane, he’s obviously not but he has similar [traits].</p>

      <p>“He’s good on the ball, good finishing and makes some good runs.</p>
      <blockquote>“He’s still young so he has a lot to learn but he’s a good lad.”</blockquote>
      <p>Parrott will be hoping to feature tonight in what is undoubtedly McCarthy’s biggest game since his return to the Irish setup at the end of 2018.</p>
      <p>The task facing him however is a difficult one, with Ireland failing to beat Denmark in their last five games and Age Hareide’s side unbeaten in the group so far.</p>
      <p>If the Boys in Green win then they book their place in next summer’s Euro 2020 finals but if they lose or draw with the Danes then they will face a two game play-off in March.</p>
