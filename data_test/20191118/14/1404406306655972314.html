      <h1>Michael Jackson's Accusers Reportedly May Get New Trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:26:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author">VladTV</a></address>
      <p>According to reports, the California Court of Appeals issued a tentative ruling that would allow the dismissal of <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/253834/michael-jacksons-estate-says-they-have-proof-accuser-is-lying">lawsuits filed by Wade Robson</a> and James Safechuck against Michael Jackson for sexual abuse to be overturned. This move was based on the grounds of a new California law that extends the statute of limitations on child sex abuse cases.</p>
      <p>Previously, Jackson accusers Robson and Safechuck filed suit against Jackson and his estate, but both cases were dismissed. Now, the two accusers may be able to present their arguments to a jury.</p>
      <p>Oral arguments for the tentative ruling are set to be made this week. Stay tuned for more details.</p>
