      <p>It’s Official, If you are not a ZANU PF supporter you will go hungry. An unnamed ZANU PF official was recorded on video telling party members that the food he had brought was exclusive to ZANU PF supporters. He is heard boldly declaring that any member of the opposition was going hungry even making a reference to the Local MDC Councillor.</p>

      <p>Exactly two years ago, Zimbabweans took the streets in a major show of how they were against the rule of then-President Robert Mugabe who was facing a challenge to his 37-year rule following a military coup a few days back. A few days later, Mugabe resigned moments before he could be impeached by a joint sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man who replaced Mugabe, speaks on his successes and how the country has changed since he assumed power.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, on November 18th, 2017, hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets in the spirit of peace, unity and hope, calling for a new start. For a new Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Coming into office a few days later, we committed to saying goodbye to the ways of the past, and to doing things differently.</p>
      <p>I immediately moved to give the people their voices back, opening new channels of communication between the people and their representatives.</p>
      <p>Criticism of the government and the presidency would no longer be taboo, but welcomed, even encouraged. I answered tough questions on my Facebook page, as I promised to be a listening president.</p>
      <p>We immediately went into an election, in which opposition parties were free to campaign wherever, whenever and however they liked. Even when I narrowly survived the Bulawayo bombing attack weeks before the election, nothing changed. The campaign continued unimpeded.On July 30th 2018, eight months after coming to office, we held the freest and fairest elections in the country’s history. While no electoral process is perfect, all international monitors noted the new and free environment of the campaigns, and the vast improvement in the electoral process.<a href="https://iharare.com/mnangagwa-speaks-on-his-successes-how-zimbabwe-has-changed-since-he-became-president-in-2017/">Read More</a></p>
