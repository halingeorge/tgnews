      <p>The eastern province have a number of concerns after they got their European campaign off to a great start with a bonus-point win over Benetton at the RDS at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Joe Tomane, who was ruled out of the win over the Italian side with a hamstring injury, will be further assessed this week before a final decision is made on his involvement.</p>

      <p>Both Rory O’Loughlin and Tadhg Furlong will be monitored this week with the duo suffering from shoulder and back issues, respectively.</p>
      <p>In more positive news, Will Connors has successfully progressed through the return to play protocols from the head injury picked up against Connacht while Robbie Henshaw is fully available after seeing some minutes against Benetton after being ruled out against Connacht will illness.</p>
      <p>Seán Cronin remains unavailable for selection due to the neck injury he picked up at the World Cup but his training load will be increased this week as he looks to step up his recovery.</p>
