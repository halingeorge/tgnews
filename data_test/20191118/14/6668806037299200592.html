      <p>The actress, who made her debut with Abhishek Kapoor’s Kedarnath, has become a hot favourite in Bollywood. She believes that the key to success is self-belief and perseverance. Sara has about 15.2 million people following her on Instagram and fan clubs across social media. Despite huge success, Sara seems to be grounded. “I may probably have a flop. I’ll be honest with you – I don’t think that there will be any amount of success that will be enough. But then, I don’t think that success is something that I’m consciously chasing,” she was recently quoted said. But she also added that she is scared that all the success and stardom might just fade away one day.</p>
