      <h1>ESPN Has New No. 1 In Week 13 Power Rankings Top 25</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:06:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN has unveiled its new power rankings for Week 13 of the 2019 regular season. The Worldwide Leader has a new team at No. 1.</p>
      <p>LSU and Ohio State have dominated the power rankings for most of the season, but neither the Tigers nor the Buckeyes have the top spot this week.</p>
      <p>Clemson, following its blowout win over Wake Forest, has climbed up to No. 1.</p>
      <blockquote>The defending national champions seem to be hitting their stride with only one game left in the regular season. The Tigers blasted Wake Forest 52-3 at Death Valley for their 26th consecutive victory on Saturday, and they’re one win from finishing unbeaten in the regular season for the second year in a row. Clemson has scored at least 45 points in six consecutive games and hasn’t allowed an opponent to score more than 14 during that stretch.</blockquote>
      <p>LSU, Ohio State and Clemson are the three clear frontrunners for the College Football Playoff right now. It’s the fourth spot where there is some major debate.</p>
