      <p><i>Good Newwz</i> is based on a major sperm goof-up between two couples with the same last name “Batra”. As the sperms of our lead male characters played by Akshay Kumar &amp; Diljit Dosanjh get replaced, the comedy of errors builds up.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Akshay Kumar and the <i>Good Newwz</i> team released the posters of the film. Sharing one of the posters, Akshay took to social media and wrote a hilarious caption: “Squeezing in some #GoodNewwz for you this #Christmas season. Stay tuned, the biggest goof-up of the year is coming your way.”</p>
      <p>Akshay also shared that “goof-ups are bound to multiply” with the movie.</p>
      <p>Directed by Raj Mehta, the film is expected to continue the winning strike of Akshay Kumar.</p>
