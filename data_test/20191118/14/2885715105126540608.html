      <h2>Reports suggest that Kamal Haasan will kickstart work on Thalaivan Irukkindraan once he finishes Indian 2.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:35:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>It looks like Vadivelu is on board for <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kamal-haasan/">Kamal Haasan</a>’s ambitious film Thalaivan Irukkindraan, and we got to know this at the Ungal Naan event held on Sunday. The Vaigai Puyal’s ten-minute speech remained the highlight of the evening, as he spoke about his working experience with Kamal Haasan during the Singaravelan and Thevar Magan days.</p>
      <p>The veteran comedian recalled that he is always a fan of Kamal Haasan, adding, “Ulaganayagan’s entry into politics was a compulsion of time.” Vadivelu mentioned an incident from the Thevar Magan sets involving Sivaji Ganesan and Kamal Haasan, which was received by the audience with thunderous applause.</p>
      <p>Thalaivan Irukkindraan was announced in 2008, but the makers had to put the project on hold due to financial constraints. Initially, Mohanlal, Venkatesh and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rishi-kapoor/">Rishi Kapoor</a> were also considered for the lead roles. Eventually in 2015, Kamal revived the project, saying it would be made in Hindi as Amar Hain, with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/aamir-khan/">Aamir Khan</a> in the titular role. But this year, surprisingly, the actor-filmmaker-politician took to Twitter and announced AR Rahman was roped in to compose the music.</p>
      <p>Several sources state that Thalaivan Irukkindraan will be a sequel to Thevar Magan. However, there’s no official confirmation on the same.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest that Kamal Haasan will kickstart work on Thalaivan Irukkindraan once he finishes Indian 2. It will be bankrolled by Raaj Kamal Films International, in association with Lyca Productions.</p>
      <p>Thalaivan Irukkindraan marks the reunion of AR Rahman and Kamal Haasan (who will write and direct the film) after 19 years. Their last collaboration was Thenali (2000).</p>
