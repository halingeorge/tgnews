      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- International carrier Emirates on Monday announced a $16 billion deal to buy 50 Airbus A350 XWB 900 jetliners, following the weekend's Dubai Air Show.</p>
      <p>Emirates said <a href="https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-announces-us-16-billion-order-for-50-a350-xwbs-at-dubai-airshow/">the order</a> was signed at the start of the show Sunday by airline CEO Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury.</p>
      <p>"This follows a thorough review of various aircraft options and of our own fleet plans," Al Maktoum <a href="https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2019/11/emirates-airline-orders-50-a350xwb-at-dubai-airshow-2019.html">said</a>. "It is Emirates' long-standing strategy to invest in modern and efficient aircraft, and we are confident in the performance of the A350."</p>
      <p>"We are strengthening our business model to provide efficient and comfortable air transport services to, and through, our Dubai hub."</p>
      <p>"The A350 will bring unbeatable economics and environmental benefits to their fleet. We look forward to seeing the A350 flying in Emirates colors," Faury said.</p>
      <p>Emirates <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbus-books-bittersweet-16-billion-deal-with-emirates-11574074430">committed $21 billion</a> in February to replace an order for the A380, a plane Airbus said it would stop making by 2021.</p>
      <p>Emirates initially planned to make an order for 70 planes. The deal Sunday followed a delivery of the A350 XWB 900 to Fiji Airways, which had also bought the new Airbus model.</p>
