      <h1>What Oklahoma’s Coaches Showed The Sooners Before Game vs. Baylor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:50:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Oklahoma pulled off one of the most-impressive comebacks of the season on Saturday night, rallying from a 28-3 deficit to beat Baylor in Waco, 34-31.</p>
      <p>The 28-3 score is apparently a pretty dangerous lead in football, as showcased by the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons and now, Oklahoma and Baylor.</p>
      <p>Believe it or not, Sooners coaches played clips from that Patriots-Falcons Super Bowl prior to Saturday night’s game against Baylor.</p>
      <p>“We watched a few clips,” <a href="https://www.normantranscript.com/oklahoma/ou-football-earlier-in-the-week-oklahoma-coaches-showed-players/article_8b902af8-0967-11ea-8dd0-0bd6c29f791d.html">cornerback Parnell Motley said.</a> “[We watched] Virginia (basketball), the struggles they went through, when they lost to a 16-seed (in 2018) and when they almost did (in 2019), but they redeemed themselves. Another (clip) they watched was the Patriots and the Falcons (Super Bowl) and it was just the same scenario. It’s crazy how ironic it is. They were up 28-3. We watched how the Patriots faced adversity and how things went. It was a great win, my team responded.”</p>
      <p>The Falcons even reacted to the game on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Oklahoma stayed alive in the College Football Playoff thanks to the comeback (the biggest in school history).</p>
      <p>The Sooners could still need some help to make it into the final four, but with just one loss, they’re very much alive in the race.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma will look to move to 10-1 on Saturday against TCU.</p>
