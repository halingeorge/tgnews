      <p><b>MEXICO CITY —</b> Brendon Todd, coming off a victory two weeks ago in Bermuda, shared the lead with fellow American Vaughn Taylor on Sunday when darkness halted the final round of the US PGA Mayakoba Classic.<br/><br/>Taylor and Todd, both on 20-under par with four holes to finish, were among seven top-10 players yet to finish their final round when sunset fell at Playa del Carmen, Mexico.<br/><br/>Mexico's Carlos Ortiz and American Harris English were on 19-under, Ortiz with one hole to play and English with four remaining. American Adam Long was on 18-under with three holes remaining.<br/><br/>Competition will resume at 7:30 a.m. local time (1230 GMT) with 12 players set to complete their 72 holes after heavy rains washed out play Thursday.<br/><br/>To win, it might take matching or breaking the 72-hole tournament record of 22-under par set last year by Matt Kuchar.<br/><br/>Todd seized the lead with a six-under par 65 in Sunday's third round and players went directly into the last round, rushing in a failed bid to complete 36 holes on the final day.<br/><br/>Todd, 34, won his first US PGA crown at the 2014 Byron Nelson Championship then ended a five-year win drought during which he battled the full-swing yips by taking the Bermuda Championship two weeks ago. This is his first start since that triumph.<br/><br/>"I feel great about my game. Happy to have a chance to win this after winning in Bermuda," Todd said. "I'm excited for the opportunity."<br/><br/>Taylor, 43, seeks his fourth PGA title after taking the 2004 and 2005 Reno-Tahoe Opens and the 2016 Pebble Beach Pro-Am.<br/><br/>"I'm just trying to hang in there best I can," Taylor said. "Didn't feel too great. I'm tied for the lead. I'm pleased."<br/><br/>Taylor birdied the third hole in his final round, made back-to-back birdies at the ninth and 10th holes and sank another at the par-5 13th.<br/><br/>Todd birdied the par-3 fourth, par-5 seventh and par-4 ninth and 12th holes to stay on top but could only par the 13th and took a bogey at 14 in the twilight before stopping on the 15th green alongside Taylor.<br/><br/>"I wanted to hit it in there close and come back tomorrow and make a birdie," Todd said. "There was probably no benefit to me playing after making two fives in a row."<br/><br/>While his playing partners raced to the 18th tee so they could finish, Ortiz decided against teeing off on the final hole due to the darkness.<br/><br/>"The last shot, it was hard to see," Ortiz said. "The decision I took not to play, I think was the right one. I have a really good chance to win. Winning in front of my family and crowd would be a dream come true."<br/><br/>Kuchar made a hole-in-one on the par-3 eighth hole in the final round while US compatriot Brian Gay aced the par-3 10th hole. — AFP</p>
