      <h1>Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes Dramatically Made Out in Public During Their Dinner Date</h1>

      <p>Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello's honeymoon phase strongly rolls on. On Friday, the couple went out to dinner at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica. Paparazzi documented key moments, including when Cabello dramatically jumped into Mendes' arms for an impromptu makeout. When you're young and superduper in love, right?</p>
      <p>Their dramatic makeout comes after they <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29770204/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-kissing-pda-basketball-game-photos/">were photographed</a> last week spending an entire NBA game kissing, cuddling, and showing practically every form of PDA imaginable .</p>

      <p>Cabello spoke to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a28872167/camila-cabello-interview-october-2019-elle-cover/">ELLE</a> in its October issue about why she and Mendes are no longer self-conscious about public affection. When asked whether she thought their initial decision to stay relatively private ultimately created more buzz, she demurred: "I don’t know; people can say whatever they want to say," she started. "They can speculate, but at the same time, we are going to live our own lives, enjoy it, and fall for each other like nobody is watching. That is how I want to live. I never want to open the door for people to feel like they are involved. Like I said, I want it to be mine and [his]. That’s why I’m so tight-lipped about it: because I want to protect it."</p>
      <p>She has since become <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29350242/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-love-interview-october-2019/">much more open</a> about Mendes in interviews. She and Mendes were always this affectionate though, starting with their <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28549505/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-miami-makeout-photos/">pool and ocean makeout</a> this summer.</p>
