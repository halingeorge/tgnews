      <p>He's a man that has been in the business for decades now but Bryan Ferry is showing no signs of slowing down yet as he has just announced a string of tour dates for next year.</p>
      <p>North East music royalty and Roxy Music frontman <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bryan-ferry">Ferry</a> has just revealed his upcoming project ‘Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1974’ alongside a brand new UK tour in March, which will of course include a gig on home turf in March.</p>
      <p>The release is a recording from his first ever solo tour and seminal performance now available to the public for the first time. The record is set to be released February 7 2020 via BMG.</p>
      <p>Achieving immediate and sensational success in the early 1970s with his group Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry has taken his place as one of the most iconic and innovative artists in popular music.</p>
      <p>Ferry began his solo career in 1973 while still a member of Roxy Music and disbanded the group following the release of their best-selling album ‘Avalon’ in 1982 to concentrate on his solo career, releasing hit singles such as ‘Slave To Love’ and ‘Don’t Stop The Dance’ and the UK no. 1 album ‘Boys and Girls’ in 1985.</p>
      <p>In 2018 Ferry released the record ‘Bitter-Sweet’ which reworked earlier Ferry and Roxy Music hits and stood alongside his participation in the Netflix series ‘Babylon Berlin’.</p>
