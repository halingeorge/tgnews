      <p>Neymar’s case is intrinsically linked to that of Kylian Mbappe. PSG are trying to tie down their two big stars but they may have to only go with one of them because of FFP. Ney wants to go, for various reasons, but from a marketing point of view and a sporting one he’s essential for the Qatari project.</p>
      <p>Ney’s salary is 30m euros net, the same Mbappe is being offered, but with extra financial costs as Ney is non-EU. Sporting director Leonardo recently said “Mbappe should be the main man at PSG&amp;rdquor; in an interview with Le Parisien.</p>
      <p>PSG think it’s easier to tie down Kylian, who will turn 21 in December and has his whole career ahead of him.</p>
      <p>Florentino Perez has not forgotten about Neymar either - he has a contract until 2022. But Madrid also want Mbappe. PSG must react and are trying to do so.</p>
