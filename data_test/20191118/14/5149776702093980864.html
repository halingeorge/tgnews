      <h1>Man jailed and labelled 'a danger to his partners' as he admits trying to bite woman</h1>

      <p>A man was described as a danger to his partners after a court heard he growled while trying to bite a woman.</p>
      <p>A one-year prison sentence was ordered for Thomas Hunt, 32, who appeared at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court</a> after admitting assault and harassment.</p>
      <p>Judge James Sampson said it was a "totally inadequate sentence" but he was limited by the maximum allowed under those charges.</p>
      <p>He said: "It is sad because a woman has such low self-esteem, such a low opinion of herself, that she is willing to forgive and forget and excuse your behaviour.</p>
      <p>"I am not in the forgiving game. Your behaviour was inexcusable.</p>
      <p>"You are in effect a danger to your partners. Your record is a bad one - you are violent again, again and again."</p>
      <p>Gurdial Singh, prosecuting, said Hunt had been convicted of assaulting the woman in August.</p>
      <p>At that time, magistrates imposed an order saying he should stay away from her.</p>
      <p>But on October 24, she texted her mother, giving the impression he had hit and strangled her. Police were alerted.</p>
      <p>Shouting alerted a neighbour who saw Hunt pinning the woman against a wall and trying to bite her.</p>
      <p>Mr Singh said: "He was growling and looked like a zombie.</p>
      <p>"The complainant had red marks to her face. The defendant was either drunk or under the influence of drugs."</p>
      <p>When the neighbour tried to intervene, "he was threatened for his trouble", said Mr Singh. The woman declined to make a statement or give details of injuries.</p>
      <p>He told the court Hunt's criminal record covers 30 offences, including eight against other people. He had been locked up for earlier assaults.</p>
      <p>In an earlier attack on the woman in this latest case, he punched and bit her, sprayed deodorant on to her face and hair while threatening to set it alight, added Mr Singh.</p>
      <p>Homeless Hunt, of Nottingham, represented himself at the hearing. The judge asked if he had anything to say. "No," replied Hunt.</p>
