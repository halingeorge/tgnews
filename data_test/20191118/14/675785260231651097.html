      <h1>Jermaine McGillvary apologises for Lions defeats as players back Wayne Bennett to stay</h1>
      <h2>Great Britain slumped to four straight defeats to raise questions over veteran coach’s future</h2>

      <p>Jermaine McGillvary has apologised to fans after the Great Britain Lions completed a disastrous tour on a sour note.</p>
      <p>Defeat against Papua New Guinea on Saturday condemned them to a four-match whitewash, following early defeats to Tonga and twice to New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Winger McGillvary said: “All I can say is sorry and it is not good enough. We caused our own downfall.”</p>
      <p>The three previous defeats have seen the Lions give themselves an uphill battle before trying to rally.</p>

      <p>In Papua New Guinea they collapsed after dominating the first half when they should probably have led by more than 10-0, courtesy of tries from Blake Austin and Josh Hodgson.</p>
      <p>They leaked a sloppy try on the stroke of half-time and then caved in alarmingly in the second half.</p>
      <p>McGillvary said: “The tour as a whole has not been great and it is kind of embarrassing talking about it.</p>
      <p>“It is not good knowing we are going home to face a backlash but deservedly so because we haven’t been good enough.”</p>
      <p>Britain were beaten 14-6 by Tonga before losing twice to New Zealand, 12-8 and then 23-8, ahead of this setback on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The four defeats, and the dull manner in which the Lions have played at times, have raised anger over Wayne Bennett’s leadership.</p>

      <p>The 69-year-old Australian’s contract as England and GB boss is now at an end but he wants to be reappointed as England coach for the next two years.</p>
      <p>It is an appointment that both McGillvary and Joe Philbin support, despite the protests from some quarters.</p>
      <p>McGillvary said: “If Wayne is getting criticism we all get it. We are in it together, whether it’s Wayne, myself or the rest of the team and the staff.”</p>
      <p>Philbin, one of the few to earn plaudits on the tour, said: “I disagree with the criticism to be honest.</p>
      <p>“We are a new group and we have lost some monumental players in Sean O’Loughlin and Sam Burgess.</p>
      <p>“The tour looks like it’s all doom and gloom but it is kind of a rebirth and we will definitely ask ourselves some honest questions.</p>

      <p>“We will go back to our clubs feeling sore and sorry for ourselves but we know what we need to do when England play Australia next year.</p>
      <p>“I completely disagree with people who say Wayne shouldn’t stay on. He has been fantastic for me and the rest of the group.</p>
      <p>“Fans back home do not see what goes on behind closed doors and the reasons behind the decisions that are made.</p>
      <p>“People make their own assumptions but we knew we’ve got a special group here and we’ve got a great leader in Wayne.”</p>
