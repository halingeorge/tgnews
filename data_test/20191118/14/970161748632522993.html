      <p>Erling Braut Haaland’s father has reportedly been seen at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>’s training ground as the Red Devils ramp up their pursuit of the in-demand Red Bull Salzburg striker.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old forward is attracting attention from some of Europe’s biggest clubs after a brilliant start to the new season, scoring an astonishing 26 goals in 18 games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>While the level in Austria might leave a little to be desired, Haaland has scored seven of his goals in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> – including a strike at Anfield.</p>

      <p>United boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> knows all about Haaland from their time together at Molde and, according to reports in Norway, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-instructs-manchester-united-sign-erling-braut-haaland-11124099/">has tasked the club with securing</a> one of the hottest young talents in Europe.</p>

      <p>Salzburg, though, will demand a massive fee for the teenager – who has five hat-tricks this season – and United could consider doing a deal in January and then <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/manchester-united-willing-loan-erling-haaland-back-rb-salzburg-complete-transfer-11166265/">loaning Haaland back</a> to the club for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://theathletic.com/1387736/2019/11/18/live-qa-chat-football-with-david-ornstein-mon-18-nov-12pm-gmt-7am-et/"><i>The Athletic</i>’s David Ornstein</a> has added more weight to the speculation, reporting that Haaland’s father, Alf-Inge, has visited United’s training ground.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old, who has previously rubbished suggestions his own ties to Manchester City could affect his son’s next move, was spotted at Carrington, suggesting United are already rolling out the red carpet.</p>
      <p>Any deal could be complicated by Haaland’s agent, Mino Raiola, who has a rather fractious relationship with United once again as Paul Pogba continues to stall over a new contract.</p>

      <p>Alf-Inge famously clashed with Roy Keane during his playing days and was on the receiving end of a brutal challenge from the United midfielder, though has nevertheless talked up interest from the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>TV2</i> in September, he said: ‘It would be nice [interest from United and others]. It is important to distinguish between being a supporter and a job. So, I have a very relaxed relationship. It’s a little different when it’s serious.’</p>
