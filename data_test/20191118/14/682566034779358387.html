      <p>Cape Town - Eddie Jones' <b>Barbarians</b> side recreated England's infamous Rugby World Cup 'V' formation in response to <b>Fiji's</b> pre-match Cibi dance at Twickenham on Saturday - but legally this time around.</p>
      <p>Jones' England side were hit with a <b><a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/RugbyWorldCup2019/england-slapped-with-fine-for-v-shaped-haka-challenge-20191030">£2 000</a></b> (R38 000) fine for crossing the halfway line when lining up to face the All Blacks' haka in their World Cup semi-final in Japan.</p>
      <p>However, the Barbarians were careful to adhere to World Rugby's protocols this time around, keeping to their half.</p>
      <p>Fiji went on to beat the Barbarians <b><a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/mapimpi-brace-not-enough-as-enterprising-fiji-down-baabaas-20191116">33-31</a></b> in the first of three matches the invitational side will play this month.</p>
      <p>Up next for Jones' side are Brazil in Sao Paulo on Wednesday, November 20, followed by Wales in Cardiff on Saturday, November 30.</p>
