      <h1>Air quality in Delhi remains 'poor', marginally better</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:38:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The air quality in Delhi improved marginally on Monday but remained in the "poor" category for the second consecutive day.</p>
      <p>At 9 am on Monday, the air quality index (AQI) in the national capital stood at 207 against an AQI of 254 at the same time on Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, there was a respite on late Sunday evening as the AQI dropped to 198, which falls under the "moderate" category.</p>
      <p>Gurgaon on Monday recorded an AQI of 138 (moderate), while Ghaziabad 231, Noida 212 and Greater Noida 204.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered "poor", 301-400 "very poor" and 401-500 "severe".</p>
      <p>Experts said strong winds due to western disturbance has helped dispersed pollutants in the Delhi-NCR region and other parts of north India.</p>
