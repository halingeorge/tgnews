      <h1>ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit Posts Message For Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:29:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is scheduled to undergo surgery today. The Crimson Tide star suffered a devastating hip injury during Saturday’s win over Mississippi State. He’ll miss the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>“For the past 24 hours our medical team has consulted with multiple orthopedic experts across the country, who specialize in hip injuries and surgeries. Based on that research, Tua is being flown to Houston tonight to be evaluated and is scheduled to have hip surgery Monday,” team orthopedic surgeon Lyle Cain said.</p>
      <p>“As previously stated, we anticipate a full recovery. The main focus has been, and will remain, on Tua, his family, and making sure we are providing them the best medical care possible.”</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/tua-tagovailoa-dancing-before-surgery-video">appeared to be in good spirits</a> at the hospital on Sunday. Several Alabama players visited the quarterback in the hospital. Thousands of people have been sending him uplifting messages on social media.</p>
      <p>ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit posted one this morning.</p>

      <p>Reports suggest that Tagovailoa should be able to recover in time to play the 2020 season. Of course, it’s yet to be determined if that’ll be at Alabama or in the NFL.</p>
      <p>For now, though, the only thing that matters is Tagovailoa’s recovery. Get well soon, Tua.</p>
