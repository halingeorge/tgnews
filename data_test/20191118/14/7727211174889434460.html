      <h2>Aintree Racecourse feature over Randox Health Grand National fences the target for Anthony Honeyball's 11-year-old</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:55:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/chris-wright/" target="_blank">Chris Wright</a></address>
      <p>Regal Encore may return to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree-racecourse">Aintree Racecourse</a> for another crack at the famous Randox Health <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/grand-national">Grand National</a> fences next month.</p>
      <p>Anthony Honeyball's 11-year-old could line up in the Randox Health Becher Chase on December 7 - the first race over the big <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree">Aintree</a> obstacles of the season.</p>
      <p>Owned by JP McManus, Regal Encore has run in two of the last three renewals of the world's greatest steeplechase - finishing eighth in 2017 and going one place better when behind dual Aintree hero Tiger Roll back in April.</p>
      <p>Honeyball is keeping his options opens for Regal Encore's next start, after he ran well when second to Vinndication in the Sodexo Gold Cup at Ascot at the start of this month.</p>
      <p>The gelding may line-up in either the Aintree feature or the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury a week on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Honeyball said: "I was delighted with his run at Ascot. It looked like he might only be fourth, but he stayed on from the last lovely.</p>
      <p>"If the weather is OK, it will be between the Ladbrokes Trophy and the Becher Chase.</p>
      <p>"They will go an end-to-end gallop in the Ladbrokes Trophy and he loves filling up in those sort of races and he finished third in it off 150. If he runs to that level again, he might finish sixth or seventh.</p>
      <p>"I think I would be in favour of the Becher Chase, as it is the race he is more likely to win, but if it was really soft or heavy, it would be a hell of an ask jumping those National fences."</p>
      <p>If Regal Encore doesn't run in the next few weeks, Honeyball may go down the veterans' chase route with the final at Sandown in January. A third crack at the Grand National on April 4 in the new year is also a possibility.</p>
      <p>Honeyball added: "The back-up plan if we bottle either the Ladbrokes Trophy or the Becher is to perhaps have a go at the cross-country chase at the next Cheltenham meeting, or the Listed chase he won at Ascot three years ago.</p>
      <p>"He has qualified for the veterans' final at Sandown and is on a very dangerous mark for that sort of race.</p>
      <p>"It is normally run on soft, tacky ground, but it is still worth taking a chance with him in it."</p>
