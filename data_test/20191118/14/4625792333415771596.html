      <p>President Trump has backed off the vaping flavor ban he promised to counter the rise in teen vaping.</p>
      <p>Trump reportedly canceled administration plans to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/trump-eyes-flavored-e-cigarette-ban-amid-deadly-illness-outbreak">roll out the ban</a> during a briefing about the potential consequences on a Nov. 4 flight to Kentucky, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/trump-s-vaping-ban-is-delayed-as-he-reconsiders-impact-on-jobs">according</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-pulls-back-from-flavored-vaping-ban/2019/11/17/30853ece-07ae-11ea-924a-28d87132c7ec_story.html">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/health/trump-vaping-ban.html">reports</a>. He told advisers that he wouldn't sign off on the ban because he was worried that it could lead to job losses and political fallout, the <i>Washington Post</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-pulls-back-from-flavored-vaping-ban/2019/11/17/30853ece-07ae-11ea-924a-28d87132c7ec_story.html"><u>reported</u></a>.</p>
      <p>The administration had faced months of pressure from public health groups to crack down on e-cigarette companies, and the proposed flavor ban garnered strong support as the number of lung injuries linked to vaping recently <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">surpassed</a> 2,000 and caused 40 deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, recently <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cdc-narrows-in-on-vitamin-e-acetate-as-cause-of-vaping-injuries">narrowed in</a> on vitamin E acetate, an ingredient in THC vaping liquids, as the likely cause of injuries and deaths. Despite evidence that THC, the high-inducing chemical in marijuana is to blame, officials have scrutinized the e-cigarette industry for marketing to teens.</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1193891291953807360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1193891291953807360&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FPolitics%2Ftrump-signals-flexibility-plans-ban-flavored-vaping-products%2Fstory%3Fid%3D66926780"><u>said Nov. 11</u></a> that he would be meeting with representatives of the vaping industry, medical professionals, and state representatives “to come up with an acceptable solution to the Vaping and E-cigarette dilemma.”</p>
