        <b>SCOTTISH rapper Darren ‘Loki’ McGarvey has insisted going to college was the key to his success - because he wasn't judged on how he talked or dressed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Loki, a former Glasgow Clyde College student, went on to win the Orwell prize in 2018 for his acclaimed book Poverty Safari after graduating.</p>

      <p>Now the 35-year-old's back at the college to help inspire and mentor current students.</p>
      <p>He told the class: “Every success that I am enjoying in my life the now I owe to getting into college.”</p>
      <p>Darren, who grew up in Pollok, Glasgow, has gone on to produce BBC Scotland mini-series Darren McGarvey’s Scotland.</p>
      <p>In the show, each episode focuses on different issues across Scotland including poverty and crime.</p>
      <p>Loki admitted his time at college was difficult – and he wants to help encourage current students to make it through to achieve their qualifications.</p>
      <p>Darren, who achieved an HND in Practical Journalism, said: “If it wasn’t for the compassion of the lecturers I probably wouldn’t have made it through.</p>
      <p>“Further education is the gateway back in not just to learning but into society.</p>
      <p>“I came into college at a time where if I didn’t get on the course – it’s debatable what would have happened.”</p>

      <p>And the rapper, who was homeless as a teen, said college is there for everyone – no matter how you talk or dress.</p>
      <p>He said: “The course gave me a language to describe all the things I was already doing.</p>
      <p>“It taught me how to sound like I could do stuff.</p>
      <p>“Cos actually I knew how to deal with people, I knew how to write, I knew how to work with kids cos I was just always trying to be natural.</p>
      <blockquote>Every success that I am enjoying in my life the now I owe to getting into college.”<cite>Darren McGarvey</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“Education is as much them trying to give you a language so that you will be accepted within certain spheres because you speak a certain way or dress a certain way and actually a lot of the stuff you need to know to get on in life.”</p>
      <p>Darren believes the college sector should be given more prominence in Scotland’s education system.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s by far the most accessible institution educationally and that extends from everything to the warm welcome you’ll receive whether you are 17 or 49.</p>

      <p>“Whether you’re someone with additional support needs, mental health problems, male, female and every other gender you could care to mention.</p>
      <p>“The difference between college and university is that FE or HE -whatever you want to call it – a college in itself is more capable of adjusting because unlike universities it’s not rooted in 500 years of institutional rigidity and history and a false sense of its own importance.</p>
      <p>“That’s why they need to receive more prominence in the discussion about education.”</p>

      <p>Darren, who was 30 when he applied to college, admits that he wouldn’t have committed to a college course in his 20s.</p>
      <p>He said: “I left home very, very early I was already bunking about in friends’ houses and lofts when I was 16.</p>
      <p>“I was getting looked after by other people’s families for a very long time. I was homeless for three years, I stayed in supported accommodation.</p>
      <p>“Now don’t get me wrong, I was still learning.</p>

      <p>“I was still active in my community and I was still making music.</p>
      <p>“I was still making a name for myself, but the whole concept of committing to a college course was beyond me.”</p>
      <p>Darren has openly spoken about his struggles growing up in poverty and his battles with addiction – and admits he still deals with some of these issues today.</p>
      <p>Not letting anything get the better of him, he’s now working on his second novel.</p>
      <p>He said: “Writing a book is like building a big wall in front of yourself and then one day you just realise you can’t see because you’ve built a big wall in front of yourself.</p>
      <p>“And then one day you start breaking though it and then you start realising the book’s nearly done.”</p>
      <p>But it’s not always easy.</p>
      <p>He admitted: “I’m a nightmare to deal with if you’re a publisher who wants a chapter plan and such and such.</p>
      <p>“For me it’s extremely challenging when you’ve got unconventional, shall we say, educational challenges.</p>
      <p>“My impulsivity is very high, I don’t regulate well emotionally.</p>
      <p>“I focus and obsess on certain things and that’s not contusive sometimes to writing a book where a conventional structure may be required.”</p>
      <p>In a final promise to fans, he added: “The book will be out at some point – I don’t know when, but I do think it’ll be a better book than the last one.”</p>
