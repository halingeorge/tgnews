        <b>A pint in the center of Dublin and a gorgeous barman serenading you with a beautiful folk tune! The dream! </b>
      </p>
      <p>The visitors to <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/topic/dublin">Dublin</a> city center's Talbot Street pub, The Celt, got quite the treat when barman, Donncha, took the leap to entertain his punters with a beautiful rendition of The Rare Auld Times one afternoon. We think you'll agree it was worth the price of a pint. </p>
      <p>The punters at Celt certainly agreed and joined in on the chorus of the famous tune. The reaction to Donnacha's performance online was glowing, of course. </p>
      <p>Just some of the responses included "amazing got shivers listening to this,"  "love his voice and this song,"  "brilliant he would get a crowd going," and "he is a beautiful singer."</p>

      <p>Love this song? </p>
      <p>The Rare Auld Times is a song composed by <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/pete-st-john-fields-athenry-dublin-rare-auld-times-famine-ship">Pete St. John</a> in the 1970s for the Dublin City Ramblers. </p>
      <p>In case you were wondering The Rare Auld Times tells the tale of Sean Dempsey, who comes from Pimlico, a working-class neighborhood in the Dublin Liberties, recalls his upbringing. He laments the changes that have occurred in the city since his youth, mentioning the loss of Nelson's Pillar, the Metropole ballroom, the "Royal" (Theatre Royal). He dislikes the "new glass cages", the modern office blocks and flats being erected along the quays, and says farewell to Anna Liffey (the River Liffey).</p>

        <b>Here are the lyrics to The Rare Auld Times so you can sing along!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Raised on Songs and Stories, heroes of renown<br/>The passing tales and glories that once was Dublin Town<br/>The hallowed halls and houses, the haunting children's rhymes<br/>That once was Dublin city in the rare ould times</p>
      <p>Ring a ring a rosey as the light declines<br/>I remember Dublin city in the rare ould times</p>
      <p>My name it is Sean Dempsey, as Dublin as can be<br/>Born hard and late in Pimlico, in a house that ceased to be<br/>By trade I was a cooper, lost out to redundancy<br/>Like my house that fell to progress, my trade's a memory</p>
      <p>And I courted Peggy Dignan, as pretty as you please<br/>A rogue and a Child of Mary, from the rebel Liberties<br/>I lost her to a student chap, with skin as black as coal<br/>When he took her off to Birmingham, she took away my soul</p>
      <p>The years have made me bitter, the gargle dims my brain<br/>Cause Dublin keeps on changing, and nothing seems the same<br/>The Pillar and the Met have gone, the Royal long since pulled down<br/>As the great unyielding concrete makes a city of my town</p>
      <p>Fare thee well sweet Anna Liffey, I can no longer stay<br/>And watch the new glass cages that spring um along the Quay<br/>My mind's too full of memories, to old to hear new chimes<br/>I'm part of what was Dublin, in the rare ould times.</p>
