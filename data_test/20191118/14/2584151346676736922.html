      <h1>Julian Assange’s prison computer not good enough, court told</h1>
      <h2>WikiLeaks founder struggling to prepare for extradition hearing, says his lawyer.</h2>

      <p>Julian Assange has been having difficulty preparing to fight against extradition to the United States because he has been given an unsuitable computer in prison, his lawyer said.</p>
      <p>The WikiLeaks founder appeared in London’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court via video link on Monday, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-assange/wikileaks-founder-assange-has-unsuitable-computer-in-jail-court-told-idUSKBN1XS1OW">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
      <p>His lawyer, Gareth Peirce, told the court that her client was unable to properly prepare for the “very challenging case” as the computer he had been given in prison was not suitable.</p>
      <p>“After months of battle, he was provided with a computer but it is not the sort of computer needed to work on the case,” Peirce said.</p>
      <p>Assange faces extradition to the U.S. over allegations he conspired to break into a Pentagon computer. He faces 17 charges of spying and one of computer hacking.</p>
      <p>Last month, a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/julian-assange-denied-delay-to-us-extradition-hearing/">court dismissed</a> a request by Assange to delay the hearing into his extradition. Assange and his legal team had requested a longer period to submit evidence in the case. But a judge in London refused the request, telling Assange that the next preliminary hearing would take place as planned on December 19 with a full extradition hearing in February,</p>
