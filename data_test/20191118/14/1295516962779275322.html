      <p>With the buzz around Marvel's upcoming <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney-plus">Disney+</a> series steadily increasing, <i>Black Panther</i> star <a href="https://screenrant.com/marvel-criticisms-scorsese-chadwick-boseman-response/amp/">Chadwick Boseman</a> was asked which of his Avengers co-stars he would want to team up with for an adventure on the small screen.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't, because I don't want to do a TV show," he said, adding that he has other things he's excited about doing and "none of those are franchises."</p>
