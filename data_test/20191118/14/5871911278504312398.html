Kyle Boehm:</b> Won an absolutely massive BJJ Fanatics Submission Only Grand Prix, defeating five grapplers in a single night, toppling Lucas Barbosa in the finals in overtime.</p>
      <p><b><pic src="https://thesportsdailydigital.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/2nd_place_ribbon__53794-1311693864-1280-1280.jpg?w=78&amp;h=124" width="39" height="62"/><pic src="https://thesportsdailydigital.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/2nd_place_ribbon__53794-1311693864-1280-1280.jpg?w=78&amp;h=124" width="39" height="62"/>  2. Jan Blachowicz:</b> Jacare isn’t the Jacare of old, but that’s six of his last seven, with his last two being wins over Luke Rockhold, and Souza. He’s working on a fine resume, and 205 needs as many fresh challengers as possible.</p>
      <p><b><pic src="https://thesportsdailydigital.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/3rd_place_ribbon__57259-1311694401-1280-1280.jpg?w=78&amp;h=124" width="39" height="62"/><pic src="https://thesportsdailydigital.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/3rd_place_ribbon__57259-1311694401-1280-1280.jpg?w=78&amp;h=124" width="39" height="62"/>  3. Linton Vassell:</b> In his second bout in Bellator since returning to heavyweight after nearly a decade at 205lbs, he finished the evergreen-tough Sergei Kharitonov Thursday in Israel.</p>
      <p><b><pic src="https://thesportsdailydigital.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/4th_place_ribbon__85639-1311694476-1280-1280.jpg?w=78&amp;h=124" width="39" height="62"/><pic src="https://thesportsdailydigital.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/4th_place_ribbon__85639-1311694476-1280-1280.jpg?w=78&amp;h=124" width="39" height="62"/>  4. Ilias Ennahachi:</b> And still OneFC Kickboxing Flyweight champion after a razor-thin split-decision of Wang Wenfeng in front of Wang’s home crowd in the main event of OneFC: Age Of Dragons.</p>
      <p><b><pic src="https://thesportsdailydigital.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/5th_place_ribbon__44932-1311694534-1280-1280.jpg?w=78&amp;h=124" width="39" height="62"/><pic src="https://thesportsdailydigital.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/5th_place_ribbon__44932-1311694534-1280-1280.jpg?w=78&amp;h=124" width="39" height="62"/>  5. Jason Knight:</b> Avenges his previous loss to Artem Lobov with a fifth-round TKO at BKFC 9. These two have fought for over nine rounds against each other, and appear so evenly-matched that a rubber match for the trilogy is inevitable, and Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship has their first huge rivalry.</p>
      <p><b>6. Dominic Boesel:</b> Is the new interim WBA World Light Heavyweight champion, and took Sven Fornling’s IBO title at 175lbs while he was at it, knocking him out in the eleventh round on ESPN+ from Germany, Saturday.</p>
      <p><b>7. Andrew Maloney:</b> Claimed the interim WBA Junior Bantamweight strap in front of his Australian crowd.</p>
      <p><b>8. Lee McGregor:</b> In the featured UK card of the weekend on ESPN+, McGregor put him British Commonwealth title on the line against Ukashir Faarooq’s BBBofC’s title at bantamweight. McGregor came out the victor in a very thin 113-114, 114-113, 115-112 split-decision.</p>
      <p><b>9. Hayden Hidlay:</b> It was #1 Hidlay vs. #4 Larry Early in the highest-ranked collegiate wrestling matchup of the weekend, and it absolutely delivered, with Hidlay earning a 4-3 edge in the match before landing a late takedown to claim the definitive win and earn enough points to tie NC State in the matchup.</p>
      <p><b>10. Roman Kryklia:</b> The inaugural ONE Kickboxing Light Heavyweight champion after a second-round TKO of Tarik Khbabez in the co-main of OneFC: Age Of Dragons.</p>
      <p><b>11. Regilio van den Ent:</b> In the main event of Enfusion 91 from Groningen, van den Ent defeated the lesser van Roosmalen.</p>
      <p><b>12. Sarel de Jong:</b> Retained her 61kg Enfusion world championship after decisioning Madelen Softeland in the co-main of Enfusion 91.</p>
      <p><b>13. Joey Beltran:</b> Pulled off the biggest upset of the week, even though, if you know Beltran’s background, no way should he have been that much of an underdog, especially in a Bare Knuckle bout. Alas, took care of business, finishing Chase Sherman and becoming the new BKFC heavyweight champ.</p>
      <p><b>14. Nikolas Motta/Shawn Teed:</b> Won the vacant CFFC lightweight and heavyweight championships, respectively.</p>
      <p><b>15. Adrian Yanez:</b> In LFA’s debut on UFC Fight Pass, Yanez escaped by Kyle Estrada by split-decision in the main event of LFA 78.</p>
