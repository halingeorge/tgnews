      <p>Four people were killed and six more wounded when unknown suspects sneaked into a backyard filled with people at a party in central California and fired into the crowd, police said.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place at about 6pm (local time) on the Fresnos southeast side, where people were gathered to watch a football game, Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley said.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Michael Reid told the <i>Fresno Bee</i> and the <i>KSEE/KGPE</i> TV stations that a total of 10 people were shot, with three found dead in the backyard. A fourth person died at the hospital. Six others are expected to survive and are recovering at the hospital.</p>
      <p>All the victims were Asian men ranging from ages 25 to 35, Reid said.</p>
      <p>What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard, Dooley said. Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.</p>
      <p>The victims were taken to Community Regional Medical Center in critical condition, and some are now stable, the TV stations reported.</p>
      <p>About 35 people were at the party when the shooting began, Reid said.</p>
      <p>Thank God that no kids were hurt, he said.</p>
      <p>No one is in custody in connection with the shooting. Police said there was no immediate indication that the victims knew the shooter or shooters.</p>
      <p>Police were going door-to-door in search of surveillance video that might help them track down the suspects.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place about a half-mile from the city's airport.</p>
      <p>Agents from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in San Francisco were responding to the shooting, the <i>Bee</i> reported.</p>
      <p>It was at least the second fatal gun attack Sunday in southeast Fresno, the <i>Bee</i> reported. A man in his 20s was shot to death early on Sunday at a home in another part of the city. Police have not said whether the incidents could be connected.</p>
      <p>Sunday's shootings in Fresno also come on the heels of at least two mass shootings in California. On Thursday, a 16-year-old student at a Southern California high school <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1517047">shot and killed</a> two classmates and wounded three other teens before shooting himself in the head. He died the next day.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, police in San Diego said a husband shot and killed his wife and three of their sons before killing himself. A fourth son wounded in the shooting was on life support on Sunday, family members said.</p>
