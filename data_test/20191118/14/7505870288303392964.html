      <p>Is live streaming part of your everyday routine? Are you trying to become one of the next big Internet personalities or do you just simply need to produce quality video content for work? Whether you’re in the conference room or the classroom, there are plenty of opportunities for video calls or chats. However, no matter what you need to capture or broadcast video for, there can always be problems when it comes to setting up a live stream. Attempting to handle all of the setup anywhere but a studio can be really difficult. But with the latest breakthrough from <a href="https://en.j5create.com/?utm_source=bgr&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=jva02">j5create</a>, worrying about a live stream will be a thing of the past.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.j5create.com/products/jcdp392?utm_source=bgr&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=jva02">Live Capture Adapter (JVA02)</a> is exactly what you need for handling video recording and playback, as it is a powerful HDMI™ capture card. It allows you to capture 60 frames per second of uncompressed 1080p video under USB™ 3.0, providing you with a remarkably clear picture and video playback. The JVA02 connects easily to the cold shoe adapter of your camera so you can live stream without any visual hiccups. You’ll be recording full HD video and audio, thanks to the USB-C™ 3.1 connection.</p>
      <p>Speaking of HD audio, while you’re consistently broadcasting, you can use three audio mixing modes to produce the sound that you want. There’s a microphone input option that will give your video the levels it needs and you’ll be able to clearly hear exactly what was recorded. There’s also a HDMI™ mode as well as a Mix mode for professional listening and recording.</p>
      <p>This adapter is made out of super lightweight aluminum, so it’s built to last and keeping it in your computer or camera bag is perfectly viable. One of the amazing features of the JVA02 is that it consumes a low amount of power but has Power Delivery 3.0, so you can charge your devices while you’re using it to live stream. It’s also fully compatible with OBS™ and other third-party software.</p>
      <p>Now if you’re wondering how exactly you get it to hook up to your camera, j5create has you covered! With the purchase of this adapter, you’ll receive a USB-C™ to USB-C™ cable, a USB-C™ to USB™ Type-A cable, a Quick Installation Guide and two screws to attach to the cold shoe adapter. It also comes backed by a two-year limited warranty.</p>
      <p>The best way to pick up one of these fantastic adapters is to stop by your local Best Buy between 11/18 and 11/24, as the store is hosting a huge blowout <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/j5create-live-capture-uvc-hdmi-to-usb-video-capture-card-black/6365290.p?skuId=6365290&amp;utm_source=bgr&amp;utm_medium=j5create&amp;utm_campaign=jva02">sale</a> for them.
