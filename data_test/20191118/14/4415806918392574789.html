      <h1>Tadhg Furlong remains doubt for Leinster after missing Benneton win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:50:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/steve-neville/" target="_blank">By Steve Neville</a></address>
      <p>Tadhg Furlong is a doubt for Leinster ahead of the province's Champions Cup clash with Lyon.</p>
      <p>The tight-head missed out on <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/rugby/garry-ringrose-hat-trick-helps-leinster-cut-benetton-to-shreds-in-champions-cup-opener-964709.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">the win over Benneton on Saturday</a>, and Leinster say he will be further assessed for a "minor back complaint" this week.</p>
      <p>Rory Oâ€™Loughlin will also be assessed this week with the centre having picked up a contact injury to his shoulder.</p>
      <p>Caelan Doris, who suffered a head injury in the Benneton clash, is due to follow return to play protocols this week.</p>
      <p>Joe Tomane's hamstring injury is due to be looked at again before "a final decision is made on his involvement this weekend."</p>
      <p>There is good news for the province, with Robbie Henshaw due to train as normal this week.</p>
      <p>Henshaw recovered from illness to be promoted to the bench last weekend following Tomane's injury.</p>
      <p>The Ireland centre came on in the final quarter for his first club shift of the season.</p>
      <p>Will Connors has also successfully come through return to play protocols.</p>
      <p>However, Sean Cronin's neck injury means he remains unavailable for selection.</p>
