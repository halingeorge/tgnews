      <p>Good Morning Britain has launched its annual project to beat the John Lewis Christmas ad on a budget – and racked up just £80 on a new clip to tug on your heartstrings.</p>
      <p>Well, it worked – and live on air, Charlotte Hawkins was mocked as she burst into tears.</p>
      <p>As the sad piano of Ellie Gouding’s I Know You Care played in the background, the clip featured a young Piers Morgan looking sad as no one would play with him.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, young Susanna becomes his friend, and while they mess about with each other, they help each other out.</p>
      <p>Piers then announces that he’s heading to America without her, leaving Susanna sad and wanting her best friend back as she heads to Salford.</p>
      <p>Putting him on her wish list for Santa, a Christmas miracle is performed and he reappears beside her, right in front of television centre.</p>

      <p>They then walk off hand-in-hand, because Christmas is a time to be emotional as hell.</p>
      <p>While the actual Piers and Susanna were unmoved by the cute scenes, newsreader Charlotte was left in tears – which obviously was made fun of immediately.</p>
      <p>‘You watched that utter load of cheese and you’re crying?!’ Piers declared, astounded. ‘This is why John Lewis do so well, because people like you fall for this!’</p>
      <p>‘Are you suddenly maternal?!’ he asked as the gang laughed.</p>

      <p>‘Just coz you’ve got a heart like a swinging brick!,’ Richard Arnold added, defending his pal.</p>
      <p>Seems you can’t win everyone!</p>
      <p>‘We wondered whether you could create an advert that had as much sentimentality, meaning and emotion, as much as that, but for a much smaller budget,’ Susanna said, revealing only £80 was forked out.</p>
      <p>Turns out all you need it a cute story and a sad song, who knew?!</p>

      <p>The ad was made as a direct retaliation for the annual tearjerker that is the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/what-time-is-the-john-lewis-advert-on-itv-tonight-11166751/">John Lewis Christmas ad,</a> which cost around £7million to make, according to reports.</p>
      <p>This year features Excitable Edgar, a young dragon who bursts out flames when he’s excited, and his best friend who helps him when he keeps having accidents that ruin Christmas.</p>
