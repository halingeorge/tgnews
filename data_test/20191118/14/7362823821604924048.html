      <p>The deaths were reported in a Central Iowa woman between the ages of 61 and 80. Another adult, a Northwest Iowa woman who was above the age of 81, also died. Both women, according to a<a href="http://idph.iowa.gov/News/ArtMID/646/ArticleID/158281/Iowa-Records-First-Flu-Related-Deaths-of-the-Season-111519"> news release from the Iowa Department of Public Health</a> (IDPH), had “underlying conditions or contributing factors” to their respective deaths. It’s not clear if they had been vaccinated against the virus or not.</p>
      <p>"The flu virus does have the potential to cause severe illness and death, especially in the very young, very old, or those who have underlying health conditions. This is a great time to get the flu vaccine to prevent yourself and your loved ones from becoming sick before flu activity increases further,” said IDPH Medical Director Dr. Caitlin Pedati, in a statement.</p>
      <p>Around the same time last week, health officials in Texas reported the state’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/texas-first-pediatric-flu-death-of-2019-2020-season">first pediatric flu death of this year’s flu season.</a></p>
