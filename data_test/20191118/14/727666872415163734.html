      <p>The Beats Electronics co-founders reminisce on the Hip Hop masterpiece from 1999.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> "All you n*ggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep," rapped Andre "Dr. Dre" Young on "Forgot About Dre." The Aftermath Entertainment head had a point to prove on the 1999 album <i>2001</i>.</p>
      <p>The body of work arrived after some naysayers questioned if Dre had reached his peak with <i>The Chronic</i> seven years earlier. On the contrary, the former N.W.A member's <i>2001 </i>demonstrated that he was still one of the most prolific producers in the music industry.</p>

      <p>Dr. Dre and his longtime business partner, Jimmy Iovine, reflected on <i>2001</i> in a new 7-minute video released via Apple Music. <i>The Making Of A Classic</i> features the two moguls discussing Dre's creative process, discovering Eminem, choosing singles, and Jay-Z writing the lyrics for the "Still D.R.E." track.</p>
      <p><i>2001 </i>includes contributions from Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Kurupt, Mary J. Blige, Knoc-turn'al, and other artists. The LP has been praised as one of the greatest rap releases of all time, and it is certified 6x-platinum by the RIAA.</p>
