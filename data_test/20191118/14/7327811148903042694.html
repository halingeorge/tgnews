      <p>JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- Police are searching for the attacker who stabbed a teenager to death in Queens on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Authorities have identified the woman as Talasia Cuffie and say she is Aamir Griffin's godsister. Griffin, 14, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/funeral-held-for-14-year-old-killed-on-queens-basketball-court/5670309/">was shot by a stray bullet while playing basketball three weeks ago in Jamaica</a>.</p>
      <p>Friends say 17-year-old Cuffie was at Griffin's home with his family after a celebration of his life, went out to get something to eat and never came back.</p>
      <p>Cuffie was then found on a sidewalk on 166th Street in South Jamaica with multiple stab wounds in the torso and the chest. Police say there were signs of a struggle.</p>
      <p>There were reports of some kind of dispute leading up to the stabbing, but details of the fight are not yet known.</p>
      <p>Cuffie was transported to Jamaica Hospital where she was pronounced dead. She lived on Vernon Boulevard in Queens.</p>
      <p>A bouquet and a candle were placed on the exact spot where Cuffie was attacked.</p>
      <p>"She didn't bother nobody, I don't undersnd why somebody would hurt her," said neighbor Betty Williams.</p>
      <p>Police do not yet have any leads in the stabbing, and the murder of Aamir also remains unsolved.</p>
