      <p>KFC has unveiled its <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/mum-charges-her-family-40-a-head-for-christmas-dinner/">Christmas</a> menu for this year and it includes a festive burger and fries.</p>
      <p>The fast food chain has announced their festive menu has arrived in stores today (November 18).</p>
      <p>There are three new items on the menu - the KFC Festive Burger, Festive Fries and a new Mint Choc Krushem Soft Serve drink.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The festive burger consists of a classic Original Recipe chicken fillet with a hash brown, sage and onion stuffing, mayo, cranberry dressing and a layer of cheese.</p>
      <p>Just wow.</p>
      <aside>A round of santa-plause for this epic festive feast please.</aside>
      <p>The burger costs £4.59 by itself or you can get it as a meal with fries for £5.59.</p>
      <p>But if you want to really push the boat out, you can buy a Festive Burger Box for £6.89, which includes the burger, a drink, fries, a tub of beans and a chicken drumstick.</p>
      <p>The festive fries are seasoned with smokey pepper, toasted onions, garlic and herbs.</p>

      <p>You can add a Mint Choc Krushem Soft Serve for £2.79 which includes vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate and mint sauce, Cookie Crunch sprinkles and finished with a chocolate bow tie.</p>
      <p>The festive menu is available until January 1, 2020, and you can also order it on Deliveroo.</p>
      <p>Top Festive Elf at KFC UK &amp; Ireland Jo Tivers said of the menu: "A round of santa-plause for this epic festive feast please.</p>
      <p>"We’ll let turkey have its moment on the 25th but until then, we’ve got your back."</p>
      <p>Last month it was revealed that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/kfc-is-selling-an-80-piece-popcorn-chicken-bucket-for-just-5-99/">KFC was testing out an 80-piece Popcorn Chicken bucket in its Glasgow stores</a>.</p>
      <p>And the best part, it was only £5.99.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The trial ended on Sunday (November 17) and if it proved popular – which we're guessing it did – KFC will consider rolling the mega-meal out in KFC branches across the UK.</p>
      <p>One fan said on Twitter: "Just heard that @KFC_UKI is trialing a 80 piece Popcorn Chicken Bucket, and for once, they test it in Scotland, I'm going to get my hands on one of these."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Seriously need one of those 80 piece popcorn chicken boxes from KFC."</p>
      <p>A third gushed: "All I’ve thought about for the past 3 days is that 80 piece popcorn chicken bucket from KFC."</p>
