      <p>Contacted for comment, the player’s representative Ratshibvumo Mulovhedzi of Rush Hour Sports Management confirmed interest in the 31-year-old, as well as talks with the Lions of the North.  </p>
      <p>“I am happy that the boy is attracting interest from clubs as that is a sign that he is a good player and doing well. Clubs are keen to sign him on a pre-contract but Highlands Park – the player’s current employers – want to keep him. The boy is valued at the club. He is well taken care of at the club and is playing regularly,” confirmed Mulovhedzi. </p>
