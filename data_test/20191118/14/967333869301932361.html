      <p>Dasypeltis scabra, a serpent originating in Africa, is better known as anÂ egg-eating snake. This video, posted on Twitter, perfectly exemplifies where the reptile got its name from.</p>
      <p>The snake is seen devouring an entire quail egg with almost no effort thanks to its awesome (although a little disturbing) ability to stretch its mouth.</p>
      <p>Those who are terrified of the little creature - don't fret! The snake is non-venomous, has no teeth and feeds exclusively on eggs.</p>
