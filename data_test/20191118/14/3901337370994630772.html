      <p>Drogba, who is widely regarded as one of the Premier League's greatest strikers ever after his two stints with Chelsea, has been backed to become the next president of the Ivory Coast Football Federation.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>BBC</i>, the 41-year-old announced his intention to run for the top job back in September, and met with more than 20 club presidents and representatives last week to discuss his plans and vision.</p>
      <p>Following the meeting, Seraphin FC president Anzouan Kouakou threw his support behind Drogba, who is the Elephants' all-time leading goalscorer with 65 international goals to his name.</p>

      <p>"Didier Drogba presented his programme with a lot of maturity and humility that I must confess is very attractive and promising," Kouakou, said.</p>
      <p>"I think it would be very interesting for us to have a leader like him as federation president because he surprised us by his maturity in the management of football.</p>
      <p>"Today, he is an icon whose image attracts tourism, but can also restore the image of Ivorian football."</p>
      <p>These views are reportedly supported by the body that oversees the third tier of football in Ivory Coast, who have backed Drogba for the presidency.</p>
