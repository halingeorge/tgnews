      <h1>'Four or five times' - The cash Nottingham Forest offered midfielder now being linked with Manchester United</h1>
      <h2>It is two years since the Reds attempted to bring McGinn to the City Ground from Hibs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:02:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author">James Pallatt</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> were offering John McGinn "four or five times his money" when they tried to sign him from Hibs, according to the Scottish Premiership club.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international is now playing in the Premier League for Aston Villa, following a move to Villa Park in August 2018.</p>
      <p>And his impressive performances in the top flight has led to him being linked with Manchester United.</p>
      <p>It is two years since the Reds attempted to bring him to the City Ground from Hibs, but they ultimately failed to agree a fee for the attacking midfielder.</p>
      <p>And Hibs' sporting director Graeme Mathie has recalled McGinn's reaction to a move to Forest breaking down.</p>

      <p>"I'll never forget the text he sent back," Mathie told the Daily Record.</p>
      <p>"He came back and said: 'Look, I get it, this is football, it's no problem at all. I'm loving being at Hibs and I want to have the best season of my career and hopefully get a move to a good club'.</p>
      <p>"Let's be honest, while John was committed to Hibs, somebody was potentially offering to give him four or five times his money to take him to the English Championship and us, as a club, had said no to that.</p>
      <p>"I thought that was an unbelievable thing for a young man to say."</p>
