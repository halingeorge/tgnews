      <p>The Love Island star, 20, was sure to have heads turning when she copied the make-up mogul's historic look from four years ago.</p>
      <p>Kylie, now 22, made the look fashionable years earlier for a shoot just a few days after her 18th birthday while her then-boyfriend Tyga watched on.</p>
      <p>It's a look any Kardashian super fan will remember.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae went for exactly the same look on her latest sun-dripping Barbados getaway over the weekend.</p>

      <p>The bombshell dressed her curves in a perilously plunging swimsuit.</p>
      <p>She accentuated her hourglass shape thanks to her costume's zip undone to reveal some of her figure and a seatbelt-style belt around her waist.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae worked her best angles in the stylish one-piece.</p>
      <p>Even down to the way she arranged her mane, the reality star ensured she nailed the make-up mogul's look by curling her locks into loose waves.</p>

      <p>It's not the first time Molly-Mae has tried to emulate the stylish successes of the American A-list stars.</p>
      <p>The devil was in the details when she took inspiration from Hailey Bieber's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/met-gala">Met Gala</a> look for the Pride Of Britain red carpet.</p>
      <p>But Molly-Mae copied the style on a budget as she slipped her figure into a pale pink dress only setting her back at Â£35.</p>

      <p>The gorgeous islander even styled her golden mane in the same swinging ponytail with a black ribbon hairgrip.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae is a rising star in her own right with as many as 3.5million <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers.</p>
      <p>The blonde bombshell has established herself as a growing social media influencer after starring on 2019's Love Island.</p>
      <p>And it turns out Molly-Mae's hair tutorial which went viral wasn't even her own idea.</p>
      <p>She told The Mirror: "They pulled me into the Beach Hut to do that and I thought it was just a normal Beach Hut but they were like, 'No this is a hair tutorial'.</p>
      <p>"I had no idea my bun had gone viral by then. The bombshells were coming in and telling me and I was like, 'You're absolutely joking'."</p>
