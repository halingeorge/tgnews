      <h2>And Tesla should be worried.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:25:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>Last week, reports claimed to reveal some <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bmw-i4-will-be-a-serious-threat-to-the-tesla-model-3">juicy new details</a> about the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/i4">BMW i4</a>, but now the German automaker has officially announced the performance specifications of the upcoming electric sedan. BMW claims the i4 "heralds a new era of driving pleasure," combining the driving dynamics, sporty and elegant styling, premium quality, and comfort of a four-door Gran Coupe with emissions-free mobility.</p>
      <p>BMW's <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3</a> rival will utilize BMW's fifth-generation eDrive technology, which will debut in the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/ix3">BMW iX3</a> in 2020, followed by the BMW iNext and BMW i4. According to BMW, the i4 "sets new standards in sporty performance."</p>

      <p>The electric motor developed for the BMW i4 produces a maximum output of around 530 hp, which is comparable to the output of a V8 engine in current BMW models fitted with a combustion engine to deliver impressive performance. With this setup, 0-62 mph takes around 4.0 seconds before the BMW i4 reaches a top speed of over 124 mph.</p>
      <p>BMW's fifth-generation eDrive technology also includes a newly designed, low-mounted high-voltage battery featuring the latest battery cell technology, an extremely flat design, and optimized energy density. Weighing around 550 kilograms, the battery pack has a capacity of around 80 kWh, resulting in a driving range of approximately 373 miles.</p>

      <p>This is likely based on Europe's WLTP cycle, which means the range will be closer to 340-350 miles in the US. The high-voltage battery of the BMW i4 can be charged to around 80 percent in around 35 minutes. As a result, it takes around six minutes to charge the i4 up to deliver a range of 62 miles.</p>
      <p>In terms of the design, the i4 will essentially be an electric version of the current <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/4-series-gran-coupe">4 Series Gran Coupe</a>, combining the proportions of a 4-door coupe with the typical design features of a BMW i model, with dynamically stretched lines and an aerodynamically optimized exterior. Production of the BMW i4 will start in 2021 at the company's main plant in Munich, where other models such as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/3-series">BMW 3 Series Sedan</a>, BMW 4 Series Coupe, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m4">BMW M4 Coupe</a> are produced.</p>
