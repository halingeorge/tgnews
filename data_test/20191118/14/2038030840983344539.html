      <p>Cape Town – Another week, another claim by Kanye West that we're all blessed to be living in the same time as him. Kanye, who leads a weekly Sunday Service, made a special appearance at Pastor Joel Osteen's service at his Lakewood megachurch in Houston on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In a video posted by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/17/kanye-west-sunday-service-joel-osteen-church-performance-choir/"><b>celebrity news site TMZ</b></a>, the father-of-four said: "Now, the greatest artist that God has ever exist- uh, created, is now working for Him."</p>
      <p>He added: "I know that God has been calling me for a long time and the Devil has been distracting me for a long time."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/kanye-west-says-hes-been-with-kim-for-500-years-because-marriage-years-are-more-like-dog-years-20191030"><b>Earlier the rapper said</b></a>: "God is using me to show off" when he got a large tax break worth millions of dollars. </p>
      <p>Just a little while ago Kanye also said that he has been with Kim for what feels like 500 years because marriage years are more like dog years.</p>
      <p>In between all of those controversial comments the creative has released an album titled <i>Jesus is King</i>, which was released well after it's the due date.</p>
