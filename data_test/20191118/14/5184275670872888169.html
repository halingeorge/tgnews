The team gathered together to unveil the trailer to the fans and Kareena and Kiara made sure they made heads turn with their sexy ensembles.</p>
      <p>Kiara went for a blush pink, mini one-shoulder dress for the event. The dress had a puffy sleeve and Kiara looked like an absolute diva in it. The upper part of the dress perfectly highlighted the curves of the actress while the bottom had overlapping details giving the dress an asymmetrical hemline. Kiara ditched wearing any jewellery with the sexy dress.</p>
