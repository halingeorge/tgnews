      <p>Performing last among the participants, the Sampaloc-based cheerdancers mesmerized the crowd with their Pinoy-inspired routine. They garnered a total of 722 points to snare their sixth overall diadem in the last seven years. "There's no such thing as an easy journey. So for NU Pep Squad, isang mahirap at exciting journey for NU Pep Squad. Lahat siguro ng mga bata is worth it 'yung pinagpaguran," NU head coach Ghicka Bernabe said. "Marami kaming occassions na na-miss dahil sa pagta-training, marami kaming sinacrifice na events with our family. And ang sabi ko lang sa kanila ay kailangan maging worth it 'yung lahat ng mga araw na na-miss niyo with your families kasi mas masarap umuwi ng champion ka," she added. On the other hand, the Far Eastern University Cheering Squad channeled its inner Michael Jackson with a thrilling performance to notch 706 points and clinch another first runner-up finish. The Adamson University Pep Squad pulled off a Caribbean-inspired routine that amassed 658.5 points to complete the podium finishers. University of Santo Tomas Salinggawi Dance Troupe fell short of barging into the top three once again, settling at fourth place with 650 points. University of the East Pep Squad (645 points) finished at fifth; University of the Philippines Pep Squad (622.5 points) came in sixth; while Ateneo Blue Babble Battalion (593 points) sat at seventh. Meanwhile, the De La Salle University Animo Squad (577.5) ended at the cellar. The team rankings are the same as last year's. The NU also annexed its dominance over the Group Stunts category of the one-day event. The Bulldogs struck gold in the said competition, besting FEU and Adamson, respectively.</p>
