      <p>Augustine Nsinga ran Afro Coast Cuisine in King Street, Dudley, where police who checked the premises  in January discovered unlicensed partying.</p>
      <p>She admitted one offence of playing unlicensed music after permitted hours and two of supplying false information to obtain temporary licenses at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court on November 14.</p>

      <p>The court heard that Nsinga, who ran the family restaurant, was effectively operating a nightclub.</p>
      <p>She applied for temporary licenses - apparently for family celebrations - but investigation of social media uncovered what was really going on.</p>
      <p>This information was passed to the local authority licensing team and further investigation discovered the false application offences.</p>
      <p>The court sentenced Nsinga to a fine of £300 on each offence, a victim surcharge of £30 and a contribution towards costs in the sum of £500.</p>
      <p>Alan Lunt, deputy chief executive at Dudley Council, said: "This is a great example of the council, police and community members working together to ensure justice is served.</p>
      <p>"It is a reminder to licence holders that they need to ensure they are fully compliant or they too could face the strong arm of the law. As a result of the prosecution the premises is now operating with a new licence with strict conditions attached."</p>
