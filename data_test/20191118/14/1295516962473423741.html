      <h1>Faith-Based Streaming Service to Launch on Strength of VeggieTales Library</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:11:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Sundi Rose</a></address>
      <p>The latest combatant in the ongoing streaming wars is a faith-based service that aims to offer content that caters to Christian families with children by employing the vast library of <i>VeggieTales</i> episodes.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-faith-based-streamer-launches-veggie-tales-library-rights-1255485">THR</a></i>, the new service, Minno, is pioneered by former Amazon employee Erick Goss and seeks to provide content for parents who want a more wholesome viewing experience for their children. Aside from <i>VeggieTales</i>, the service will offer other shows and series that Christian parents feel safe showing to kids, as well as a parenting blog and a publishing division that will produce further faith-based content.</p>

      <p>Although not necessarily unique in its Christian-based model, Minno is the most fully realized and is meant to reach the millions of Americans who attend church regularly. "There's tons of content out there, but almost nothing speaking to Christian parents," Goss said. "When we talk to them, they feel compromised. With Minno, they don't have to hover and be uber-vigilant."</p>
      <p>"Minno had been in beta with 20,000 subscribers in 40 countries, and most of its 2,500 episodes of content licenses involve global rights," he added, making its imminent future look promising.</p>
      <p>Minno subscriptions can be purchased for $6.99 a month or $69.99 annually at <a href="http://gominno.com/">GoMinno.com</a>.</p>
