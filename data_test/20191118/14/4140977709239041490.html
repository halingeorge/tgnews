          </p>
          <p>Riddled by inconsistency, this edition of the Marsh One Day Cup has not played out favourably for Victoria. The side have managed to squirm ther way to a mere two wins in five matches with apart from sporadic displays, the unit managing to dole out nothing of real note till now.</p>
          <p>Their peril sees them slumped in fourth place in the league standings, well six points ahead of their opponents of today. The side come into this clash having been defeated by 9 runs through the DLS method by Western Australia as they failed to chase down the revised target of 174 in 20 overs after rain marred their clash proceeding Western Australia’s batting effort where they put on 281 while batting effort.</p>

                <p>Chasing a deficit as things stand as they look to rejuvenate their season, Victoria know things aren’t going to get any easier when they take on a South Australia unit who enter the land of today’s dramatic contest having tallied up their third win of the season the last time around. Persevering in their pursuit of 296, the three wicket win was a vital one for the side in their bid of challenging for a spot in the pinnacles of the league standings, a display they’ll be looking to emanate against a sordid opposition come today.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>The team winning the toss is bound to step out and bat first with this being an extremely good batting surface. With just the lone match being contested here till now in the tournamnet, we are going to have a fresh track, one which allows the batters to come on and open their arms with ease to pile on the runs before the wicket peters off just the slightly to make chasing a tough task.</p>

                            <h3>VCT Vs SAU Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>At a time when Victoria were reeling under a carnage as their top-order fell apart and lost its way in the bygone fixture, Peter Handscomb played out a stunning knock, one which rescued his side from the aberration of folding out for a sorry score. The side’s wicket-keeper strung together a stellar 73 runs in 54 balls, an innings which not only held fort for his side but came at a time when he was getting no assistance from the other end.</p>
                            <p>We are getting in the opposition’s wicket-keeper as well meanwhile with Alex Carey being in sublime touch this tournamnet. He scored a resplendent knock of 79 runs the last time around, a knock which was quintessential in seeing his side getting past the finishing line without any jitters.</p>
                            <h3>VCT Vs SAU Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>His unbeaten knock of 54 runs in the side’s last outing couldn’t have come at any better time with Jake Lehman ensuring that the barrage of wickets his side suffered in the middle stages of their run chase didn’t quell them in their pursuit of the target at hand. South Australia’s opener Callum Ferguson scored the 91 runs in the same affair for his side, making him the second pick from the unit whilst from the other side we are choosing the returning opener Aaron Finch.</p>
                            <h3>VCT Vs SAU Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>After sending down the 6 overs for 2-32 in the last match, Matt Short from Vitoria was always going to find a place in our outfit. The all-rounder did more than his requisite job of just filling in the overs as he took accountability and onus of snaring wickets at crucial junctures and sending back well settled batsmen.</p>
                            <p>Cameron Valente might have gone wicketless for South Australia the last time around but with the player being ascertained of 10 overs with the ball as well as beg handed over a crucial job with the bat as well, we had to make him our choice for the day. Tom Cooper will be coming in as well from the side keeping in mind the role he holds akin to Valente.</p>
                            <h3>VCT Vs SAU Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>While Adam Zampa has been impressive with the ball this edition of the marquee Australian domestic tournament with him returning with the two wickets in the last encounter as well, the bat showcased his abilities with the bat as well as he went onto score the 20 runs. He will be accompanied by the feisty and fiery Kane Richardson who flourished against Pakistan in the T20 series while from the other side of the segment we have decided to venture in with Jackson Coleman for today.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to make Alex Carey our unit’s captain for the day while Finch will be our vice-captain.</p>
