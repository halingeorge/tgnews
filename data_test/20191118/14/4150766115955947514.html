      <h1>Iraqis seal bridges, roads as protests pick up pace</h1>

      <p>Striking Iraqis sealed off key bridges and avenues in Baghdad and across the south on Sunday, boosting a weeks-long street movement that is demanding a government overhaul.</p>
      <p>Sit-ins have become the go-to tactic for rallies that erupted in early October in fury over corruption, a lack of jobs and an out-of-touch political class.</p>
      <p>They have resisted efforts by security forces to snuff the gatherings out, and on Sunday thousands came out across the country after activists called for a general strike.</p>
      <p>In the southern hotspots of Kut, Najaf and Diwaniyah schools and government offices were shut as swelling crowds hit the streets.</p>
      <p>Protesters burned tyres to block roads in the oil-rich port city of Basra and outside Nasiriyah, prompting security forces to send reinforcements.</p>
      <p>In Hillah, south of Baghdad, students and other activists massed in front of the provincial headquarters.</p>
      <p>“We’ll keep up our protest and general strike with all Iraqis until we force the government to resign,” said Hassaan al-Tufan, a lawyer and activist.</p>
      <p>In Baghdad, protesters expanded their sit-in from the main protest camp of Tahrir (Liberation) Square further north to the Al-Ahrar (Free Men) bridge.</p>
      <p>Along with Al-Jumhuriyah and Al-Sinek, that brings to three the number of bridges whose eastern approaches are occupied by protesters.</p>
      <p>They are highly strategic, linking the eastern bank of the Tigris to the west, where parliament, the prime minister’s office and other key buildings are located.</p>
      <p>Along each bridge, security forces stationed behind thick concrete blast walls lob tear gas grenades and shoot live rounds – even machine-gun fire – to keep protesters back.</p>
      <p>Al-Jumhuriyah leads to the Green Zone, the high-security enclave housing the US embassy.</p>
      <p>Al-Sinek, which protesters retook on Saturday, leads to the embassy of neighbouring Iran, which protesters have criticised for propping up the government they want to bring down.</p>
      <p>Iraq’s neighbour has faced its own deadly agitation since a hike in petrol prices was announced on Friday in a country already crippled by US sanctions.</p>
      <p>Tehran holds immense sway over many of Iraq’s political and military actors, but large numbers of protesters have described its influence in recent weeks as an overreach.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, hundreds of students skipped class to gather in Tahrir, the beating heart of the protest movement.</p>
      <p>“No politics, no parties, this is a student awakening!” read one banner carried by young Iraqis with rucksacks.</p>
      <p>“We students are here to help the other protesters, and we won’t retreat a single step,” said a teenager wearing thick black-framed glasses.</p>
      <p>Their push north onto Al-Ahrar bridge was met with heavy gunfire and tear gas, witnesses there said.</p>
      <p>A medical source said one protester died of a trauma wound from a tear gas canister, and more than 40 other people were wounded.</p>
      <p>Another person was wounded when a rocket hit a commercial street on the eastern bank of the river late on Sunday, the security services said in a statement.</p>
      <p>More than 330 people have died and around 15,000 people have been wounded since the protests first broke out.</p>
      <p>Iraqi security forces have come under heavy criticism for their use of live rounds – including machine-gun fire – and firing of heavy-duty tear gas canisters in response to protests.</p>
      <p>They have been accused of firing tear gas at point-blank range, leading to “gruesome” deaths and injuries when canisters pierce protesters’ skulls or lungs.</p>
