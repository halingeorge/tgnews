      <p>India are not looking at revenge but full points against Oman, skipper Sunil Chhetri said on Monday as they gear up to take on the hosts in a FIFA World Cup Qualifiers match here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Omna had beaten India 2-1 in Guwahati in September but Chhetri dismissed talks about India gunning for revenge.</p>
      <p>“We won’t think about revenge or anything closer to that, absolutely not. At the end of the day, the points matter. It’s not a derby as they are not our neighbours,” Chhetri said during a training session.</p>
      <p>“These are the qualifiers and we have only one thing in our mind, to go out and give everything that we have and take the result. I mean the important point is to go and play well, especially in the away matches.”</p>
      <p>Oman striker Al Mandhar has already scored four goals in four matches during the Qualifiers but Pritam Kotal felt everyone should be dealt with equally to come out with a favourable result.</p>
      <p>“It’s not only Al Mandhar, other attackers like Al Alwai, Al Ghassani everyone can impose equal danger to a defence line. They are quick, they switch positions fast and can score from long. We have to be extra cautious of their long-range shots,” Kotal opined.</p>
      <p>In the first leg, Chhetri scored India’s only goal which could have earned the Blue Tigers their first win against the Gulf Nation but Al Mandhar scored back-to-back goals to dent India’s dream.</p>
      <p>The two countries have played eight matches against each other until now and Oman were on the winning side six times whereas the other two matches ended in a draw.</p>
      <p>On being asked whether these stats will put India under pressure before they hit the ground, Adil Khan felt otherwise.</p>
      <p>“Yes, numbers say that they (Oman) are favourites but it all will start from scratch. Their attackers can do anything on a given day and we have to be on our toes throughout,” Adil stressed.</p>
      <p>Custodian Gurpreet Singh Sandhu picked that staying unbeaten on the road is the priority now and Oman is going to be a difficult opponent to play against.</p>
      <p>“It’s always difficult playing away from home and we recognise the threats (from Oman) given their ability and strength. We have to make sure we deal with them well.”</p>
