      <p>FAIRFIELD, Iowa â€” Montana governor and democratic candidate for the 2020 presidential election Steve Bullock stopped in Fairfield, Iowa, on Monday for a meet and greet.</p>
      <p>One point of emphasis was that he believes he can beat President Trump. <br/><br/>Bullock also spoke about knowing that the voters want someone they can trust. His reply to that is to look at his track record and you will believe that you can trust in him. <br/><br/>One of the things Governor Bullock has done was win a red state to become governor.</p>
      <blockquote>"Well I think even from the perspective of if you want to know what I'm going to do, look at what I've done. I mean I've been able to bridge divides. Twenty-five to 35% of my voters also voted for Donald Trump. We've been able to do those things where I actually have a record. I mean I would say to be honest with ten years serving in an executive role, I have more years of executive experience than anyone in this field, including the vice president," says Governor Bullock.</blockquote>
      <p>Governor Bullock is the only governor left in the presidential race. Another thing to note is that Governor Bullock has not been chosen to speak at the next Democratic Primary Debate on Wednesday.</p>
