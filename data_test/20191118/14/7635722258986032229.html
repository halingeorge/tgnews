        <b>Police in the North say it's too early to determine if an ATM robbery in Belfast over the weekend is linked to an attempted theft in Co Down this morning.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The roof of a petrol station in Ballynahinch collapsed after thieves tried to rip a cash machine from the wall with a bulldozer overnight.</p>
      <p>Police said those believed to be involved caused "substantial damage" before fleeing the scene.</p>
      <p>Separately, a staff member arrived at their workplace on Saintfield Road in Belfast discovered this morning that an ATM machine had been taken.</p>
      <p>The theft's believed to have happened between Friday evening and this morning.</p>
      <p>Investigations into both incidents are said to be at a 'very early stage' and it's unclear whether they are linked.</p>
      <p>PSNI Detective Inspector Richard Thornton said: “ATM theft and attempted theft is not a victimless crime and these attacks cause untold loss and disruption to people and businesses, many of whom depend on their local ATM provision for access to cash."</p>
      <p>He added that the Ballynahinch incident was a "brazen and despicable attack" that has led to widespread disruption in the area.</p>
