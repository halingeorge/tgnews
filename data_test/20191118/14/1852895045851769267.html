      <h4>Selena Gomez looked drop-dead-gorgeous in a bright orange velvet dress when she attended the ACLU Annual Bill of Rights Dinner in Beverly Hills on Nov. 17.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/Selena-Gomez"><b>Selena Gomez</b></a>, 27, was an absolute vision at the ACLU Annual Bill of Rights Dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills on Sunday, Nov. 17, when she made a rare red carpet appearance in a skintight bright orange velvet dress. Her long-sleeve chevron <b>Prada</b> dress featured a tight bodice with a seam down the entire front of the dress, while a large collar was wrapped around her neck. A belt cinched in her tiny waist, while the rest of the skirt flowed into a fitted skirt and she accessorized with a pair of black <b>Prada Platform Sandals</b>. As for her glam, Selena’s makeup was done by <b>Melissa Murdick</b>, who gave her a soft matte complexion, a light brown smokey eye, and a sultry deep red lip. As for her hair, she left it down in a voluminous blowout with her ends flipped up into curls at the ends.</p>
      <p>It is very rare for Selena to make a red carpet appearance, so when she does, it’s always a pleasant surprise. Aside from this look, her last red carpet was at the <i>Frozen II</i> premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Nov. 7. Selena arrived with her little sister, <b>Gracie Teefey</b>, and they looked gorgeous when they wore floral <b>Marc Jacobs</b> maxi dresses with <b>Pandora</b> jewelry and had their hair down in stunning braided pigtails.</p>
      <p>When Selena isn’t slaying the red carpet, she is <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/12/celebrities-wearing-affordable-clothes-fashion/">usually dressed down</a> and lately, she’s been wearing a ton of affordable outfits. She was just out in LA on Nov. 5, when she wore a skintight, faded snakeskin print <b>Leset Sophia Sleeveless Mock-Neck T-shirt</b> with a pair of high-waisted baggy mom jeans. She topped her look off with an oversized white <b>American Eagle Faux Sherpa Jacket</b>, which she chose to keep open, and a pair of white <b>Puma Gv Special+ Sneakers.</b></p>
