      <h1>9-year-old boy ‘fighting for his life’ after San Diego murder-suicide: relatives</h1>

      <p>A 9-year-old San Diego boy who survived a murder-suicide that claimed the lives of his parents and three brothers is clinging to life, relatives said.</p>
      <p>The boy, Ezequiel Valdivia, was “fighting for his life” in an intensive care unit at a hospital late Saturday after the early-morning shooting at the family’s home in San Diego’s Paradise Hills neighborhood, according to an online fundraiser set up by his uncle.</p>
      <p>“As sad as this moment is, the cost of burial and medical bills will be much more than the requested goal is,” the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/tragic-murders-leave-one-fighting-for-his-life">website reads</a>. “Anything is a welcome blessing to help us through this tragic moment in our lives.”</p>
      <p>Ezequiel remained in critical condition Sunday after having emergency surgery for gunshot wounds to his head and leg, <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/2019/11/17/9-year-old-boy-fighting-for-his-life-after-family-shooting/">KSWB reported.</a></p>
      <p>The boy’s mother was identified by relatives and friends as Sabrina Rosario, 29. Her three sons who were also killed during an apparent act of domestic violence were 11-year-old Zeth Valdivia, 5-year-old Zuriel Valdivia and 3-year-old Enzi Valdivia, <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2019-11-17/boy-who-survived-mass-murder-suicide-fighting-for-his-life-family-members-say">the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.</a></p>
      <p>Sabrina had recently obtained a restraining order against her 31-year-old husband, Jose Valdivia, and police had visited the home at least once before to “preserve the peace,” the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Her sister, Jocelyn Rosario, <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Family-Remembers-Mother-Children-Killed-in-Apparent-Murder-Suicide-Paradise-Hills-Father-565071702.html">told KNSD</a> that Jose had trouble accepting the fact the couple was headed for divorce and began stalking his wife, telling her that he had suicidal thoughts. Valdivia also sent Sabrina photos of alcohol and a gun, Jocelyn told the station.</p>
      <p>Sabrina tried calling calling her brother-in-law, Karl Albright, early Saturday just before the shooting, only to leave a harrowing voicemail, he said.</p>
      <p>“You could very clearly understand she was terrified,” Albright said. “The last thing she had said was, ‘Is that your gun?’”</p>
      <p>Sabrina had spent the past year “living in fear” as Jose struggled to accept her filing for a divorce that was never finalized, KNSD reported.</p>
      <p>Police had not formally identified any of the victims as of Sunday, the Union-Tribune reported.</p>
