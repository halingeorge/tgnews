      <h1>Niger opposition figure jailed after return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:00:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>A leading opposition figure in Niger who returned from self-imposed exile last week was jailed on Monday to serve out the rest of his time for a conviction of baby smuggling, his family told AFP.</p>
      <p>Hama Amadou, 69, who had flown home last Thursday after his mother died, "was incarcerated early today in Filingue," 180 kilometres (110 miles) north of the capital Niamey, a relative said.</p>
      <p>"He went to court voluntarily and was taken to prison."</p>
      <p>A former premier and parliamentary speaker, Amadou has been nicknamed "the Phoenix" for his political comebacks.</p>
      <p>In November 2015, he was arrested on his return from abroad and charged with baby-trafficking -- a case that supporters said was trumped-up.</p>
      <p>He campaigned for the March 2016 presidential elections from behind bars, gaining 17.7 percent of first-round votes behind President Mahamadou Issoufou, who won 48.4 percent.</p>
      <p>He was released on medical grounds four days before the runoff ballot, flew to France and remained abroad until his return last week.</p>
      <p>In March 2017, 20 people, including Amadou, were convicted in the case, which allegedly entailed smuggling babies from Nigeria via Benin for wealthy couples in Niger.</p>
      <p>He was given a 12-month sentence in absentia, of which eight months have still to be served, after time spent in prison is taken into account. One of his wives was also sentenced.</p>
      <p>In August this year, Amadou was named by the Nigerien Democratic Movement (Moden), the country's main opposition party, to be their champion in the next presidential elections, due in December 2020.</p>
      <p>Issoufou, a former prime minister, has been president since 2011.</p>
      <p>His country has a history of political volatility and has only had a multi-party democracy since 1990.</p>
      <p>The impoverished Sahel state has one of the lowest rates of development in the world. Three-quarters of the population live on less than $2 a day.</p>
