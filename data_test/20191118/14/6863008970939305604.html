      <p>Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) has sent a draft notice of suspicion against former President Petro Poroshenko to the Prosecutor General's Office (PGO).</p>
      <p>"The charge papers have been drafted and sent to the prosecutor's office as part of a pretrial investigation into possible unlawful influence on a competition to select candidates for the appointment of members of the High Council of Justice in March-May 2019," the SBI wrote on Facebook on November 18.</p>
      <p>"The document refers to the suspicion of the fifth president of Ukraine of committing criminal offenses under Part 3 of Article 109 and Part 2 of Article 364 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine," it said.</p>
      <p>The SBI also sent the PGO a draft motion seeking the Ukrainian parliament's consent to prosecute Poroshenko, who is an incumbent Member of Parliament.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, SBI Director Roman Truba said that Poroshenko is a figure in 13 criminal cases and has already failed to show up for 15 <a href="https://www.unian.info/politics/10707597-poroshenko-skips-questioning-by-sbi-in-maldives-trip-case.html">interrogations</a>.</p>
