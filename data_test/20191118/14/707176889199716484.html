      <h1>John Legere to step down as T-Mobile USA chief</h1>
      <h2>COO Mike Sievert to take over from May next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:07:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author">Nic Fildes</a></address>
      <p>John Legere has called time on his stint as chief executive of T-Mobile USA after anointing longtime deputy Mike Sievert to replace him next year at the top of America’s third-largest telecoms company.</p>
      <p>Mr Legere, the self-styled “bad boy” of the US telecoms sector who referred to himself as “Batman” on the conference call announcing his exit, will leave the company at the end of April after almost eight years at the helm.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9906c8f8-06ed-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">61-year-old</a> on Monday denied reports that he had held talks with WeWork about the SoftBank-controlled office sharing company’s vacant chief executive role but said he had not been able to comment as he prepared to announce his departure from T-Mobile.</p>
      <p>Mr Legere’s departure represents a changing of the guard at the German-owned US telecoms company with Braxton Carter, its chief financial officer, also leaving next summer.</p>
      <p>The company has grown from a struggling outpost of Deutsche Telekom’s empire when Mr Legere joined in 2012 to a brash and abrasive challenger in the staid US telecoms market. He led the company’s acquisition of rival MetroPCS and its float on Nasdaq in 2013 and the business now accounts for most of Deutsche Telekom’s value.</p>
      <p>Mr Legere will stay on to complete the acquisition of now <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/603cb75e-7a43-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d">smaller rival Sprint</a> before formally handing over to Mr Sievert, whom he hired in 2012 as chief marketing officer. He will remain on the board of T-Mobile USA.</p>
      <p>Neville Ray, the company’s long-term chief technology officer, has also been promoted to a new role of president of technology ahead of a wider shake-up when the Sprint deal completes.</p>
      <p>The $59bn combination of T-Mobile and Sprint has been cleared by the US communications regulator but still faces legal opposition from a coalition of state attorneys-general challenging the deal on competition grounds. Mr Legere had been named head of the enlarged company but will leave Mr Sievert to handle the integration if the deal finally goes through.</p>
      <p>Mr Sievert has long been considered heir apparent to Mr Legere after he was promoted to the role of president and chief operating officer in 2015. He has been one of the key architects of the company’s consumer-focused strategy based on the “Uncarrier” model that has taken the fight to Verizon and AT&amp;T, the company’s larger rivals which Mr Legere has dismissed as “dumb and dumber”.</p>
      <p>Mr Legere praised Mr Sievert. “I hired Mike in 2012 and I have great confidence in him,” he said. “I have mentored him as he took on increasingly broad responsibilities, and he is absolutely the right choice as T-Mobile’s next CEO.”</p>
      <p>Tim Höttges, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, which controls T-Mobile USA, led the praise for Mr Legere, with the US company now the main driver of its German parent’s growth. T-Mobile’s customer base has risen from 33m to 84m since Mr Legere took over and landing Sprint would take it to 137m.</p>
      <p>“John Legere has had an enormously successful run as CEO,” said Mr Höttges, who is chairman of T-Mobile USA.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile shares have dipped at the prospect of an exit for Mr Legere, who previously worked at Dell, AT&amp;T and Global Crossing. The stock dropped 0.5 per cent after he confirmed his departure.</p>
      <p>Mr Legere said he was not retiring and joked that he might become a celebrity chef as a result of his weekly “slow cookery” broadcasts on Facebook.</p>
