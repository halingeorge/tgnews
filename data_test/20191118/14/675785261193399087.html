      <h1>UK weather forecast: Met Office issues 'danger to life' warning for freezing fog</h1>
      <h2>Met Office has issued a new yellow weather warning for large regions, including most of the Midlands, Home Counties, south of England and southeast of England and London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:58:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Joseph Wilkes, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Freezing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">fog</a> will blanket Britain tomorrow, sparking transport chaos on the roads and in the air, forecasters warn.</p>
      <p>New yellow <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warnings for freezing fog from 4am to 11am have been issued and it's feared the dense fog will cause mayhem - especially at rush hour.</p>
      <p>"Some dense fog and freezing fog patches on Tuesday morning likely leading to some travel disruption," the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> spokesman said.</p>
      <p>People are being told to expect "slower journey times with delays to bus and train services possible."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile "there is a chance of delays or cancellations to flights."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The worst-affected areas include most of the Midlands, Home Counties and southeast of England.</p>
      <p>Temperatures in these regions will struggle to exceed 5C.</p>
      <p>The Met Office warns: "Travelling in fog can be extremely dangerous. Fog can drift rapidly and is often patchy."</p>
      <h3>Advice for road users when travelling in fog</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid travel if possible</li>
        <li>Drive very slowly with dipped headlights, full-beam lights reflect off the fog causing a 'white wall' effect</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on your speed, fog can give the illusion of moving in slow motion</li>
        <li>Use fog lights, but remember to turn them off when the visibility improves</li>
        <li>Don't hang on the tail lights of the car in front, rear lights can give a false sense of security</li>
        <li>Watch out for freezing fog which is made of water droplets that freeze on contact with objects such as the pavement, road, car, etc. It can quickly form a layer of ice.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It comes after wintry showers swept across the UK this morning.</p>
      <p>Icy surfaces could remain a hazard tomorrow, forecasters say.</p>
      <p>Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “Temperatures could dip to -8C (17.6F) or -9C (15.8F).... on Monday night.</p>
      <p>“This would be the coldest night of autumn with the lowest temperature we have seen so far being -8.1C (17.42F).”</p>
      <p>A netweather.tv spokesman added: "After a day with highs of 4-9c (coldest in the north), temperatures will quickly fall during the evening bringing a widespread frost and a few fog patches overnight."</p>

      <p>Sub-zero temperatures are expected to continue tomorrow morning, although things will feel slightly warmer in the afternoon.</p>
