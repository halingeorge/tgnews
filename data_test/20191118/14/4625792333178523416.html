      <h1>‘I like the idea’: Trump will 'strongly consider' giving impeachment testimony to get Congress moving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:42:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>President Trump claimed he would “strongly consider” delivering impeachment testimony if it would get Congress to start working on other issues, such as the USMCA trade deal.</p>
      <p>During Sunday’s <i>Face the Nation</i> on CBS, Pelosi <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pelosi-trump-has-every-opportunity-to-present-his-case-on-impeachment">suggested that Trump could testify</a> if he wants to tell his side of the impeachment story. She noted that he could deliver his testimony in person or in writing.</p>
      <p>On Monday morning, Trump replied by slamming “do nothing” and “nervous” Pelosi for spending time focusing on impeachment rather than addressing other issues. He added that he would consider testifying “in order to get Congress focused again," saying, he likes "the idea" of it.</p>

      <p>Trump noted, however, that he thinks his testimony would give credibility to the “phony impeachment witch hunt.”</p>
      <p>Republicans have criticized Democrats for not allowing certain witnesses to be questioned as part of the impeachment hearing and have argued that Trump has been <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/rep-rick-crawford-house-democrats-impeachment-resolution-spits-on-the-face-of-due-process"><u>denied due process</u></a>. Pelosi was not the first Democrat to invite Trump to testify. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch told Republican Rep. Jim Jordan that Trump was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/democrat-met-with-laughter-after-suggesting-trump-testify-before-impeachment-committee"><u>welcomed to come to testify</u></a> during Wednesday’s hearings, sparking laughter in the hearing room.</p>
