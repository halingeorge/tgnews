      <h1>Developers reveal £30m Newcastle hotel plans with rooftop swimming pool, bars and clubs</h1>
      <h2>The enormous city centre project could create more than 500 jobs and attract international operators</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:23:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author">Coreena Ford</a></address>
      <p>Plans to create a £30m luxury hotel and leisure development in the heart of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle</a>, complete with a rooftop swimming pool and several terraces, bars and restaurants, have been sent to planners.</p>
      <p>The Malhotra Group first unveiled plans to open a hotel coined The Dorchester of the North around 10 years ago, and received planning permission several years ago.</p>
      <p>That permission has since expired, but the Newcastle care, leisure and property group has in recent years carried out a spending spree in the city centre, buying up numerous properties which allow it to submit a revised application for a significantly larger hotel and leisure complex that takes up an entire section of Mosely Street, Cloth Market and Grey Street.</p>
      <p>The ambitious project is now set to go before planners, with documents detailing the scale of the project which has the potential to create 510 jobs, during its construction, once complete and through the supply chain.</p>
      <p>The firm is in discussions with top international brands to operate the hotel, which it hopes will become popular with visitors, the business community, students and the wider public.</p>
      <p>Meenu Malhotra, chairman of the Malhotra Group said it would include a rooftop bar and swimming pool with an ornate glass, open-sided canopy, three rooftop terraces, two nightclubs which will also be international brands, as well as a number of restaurants and cafes.</p>
      <p>The 104-110 bedroom hotel will have its own restaurant, two bars and three separate rooftop bars, as well as a health spa, gym, conference facilities and an executive lounge.</p>
      <p>Plans for the hotel include a lift taking guests and visitors straight to one of the rooftop bars.</p>
      <p>Two leisure business currently operate from the corner positions of the property block – Flares and Vineyard – and the Malhotra Group has revealed these will stay as tenants.</p>
      <p>Soho Rooms will go, however, and the building next door will become a VIP nightclub. London chain Chinawhite is among the firms in discussions for this site.</p>
      <p>The enormous project would see all the existing Grade II and II* listed buildings retained on the site, but the rear-offshoots to 5-9 Grey Street will be demolished to create a new atrium space.</p>
      <p>Demolition teams would also knock down 29 Mosely Street – built in the 1950s – and 4 Cloth Market – constructed in the 1930s – which would then be rebuilt. The luxury hotel will take up the upper floors of 3 -17 Grey Street, Drury Lane, 4 - 8 Cloth Market and 31 Mosley Street.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a new two-three storey extension above Drury Lane and Balmbra’s Hall is planned to provide additional bedrooms.</p>
      <p>The regeneration of Balmbra’s will also include the creation of a hotel function room and conference room, and a hotel bar and restaurant will also be created on the ground floor of 3 - 13 Grey Street, where a new entrace will be built.</p>
      <p>The roof top terrace and swimming pool, meanwhile, will be built at 29 Mosley Street.</p>
      <p>CGIs and a design statement have been submitted by Space Architects, alongside a planning statement by the Newcastle office of consultancy Lichfields.</p>

      <p>The planning statement concludes: “The proposals are to restore and re-use these predominately vacant buildings, whilst minimising the loss of original or early phases of fabric.</p>
      <p>“The proposals will also support the continued regeneration of Grainger Town, through bringing forward a sensitively designed scheme that respects the character and appearance of the subject site and surrounding important historic buildings.</p>
      <p>“Importantly, the proposals will deliver most significant economic benefits including a total capital investment of around £30m; the creation of around 160 direct (FTE) jobs and around 185 indirect/induced ‘spin off’ (FTE) jobs per year throughout the two-year, nine-month build period.</p>
      <p>“Once complete, the new hotel, retail and leisure uses will provide around 105 direct (FTE) jobs on-site and around 60 indirect/induced (FTE) jobs across the wider region.”</p>
      <p>Mr Malhotra added: “We want this to be for the enjoyment of all, so it will be high end in terms of fixtures and fittings but we are very conscious that it is affordable, and prices will be at a price point to ensure that as many people as possible can enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“Standards are important to us but affordability for the locals is very, very important.</p>
      <p>“We are very proud to be bringing that area back to its former glory. It’s not just a business we are establishing but a legacy that our family want to deliver and leave for the city.”</p>
