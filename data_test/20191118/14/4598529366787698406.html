      <p>Craig Silverman, a host at Denver conservative talk radio station KNUS, was fired mid-show over the weekend after airing a segment criticizing President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/us/denver-radio-host-fired-in-mid-show-after-criticizing-trump.html">According to the New York Times,</a> the station suddenly cut away to a news segment during his show as the station’s operations manager burst into the room: “you’re done,” Silverman was told.</p>
      <p>Silverman felt increasingly unwelcome at his own radio station, taking to Twitter and other shows to air his opinions.</p>
      <p>KNUS reportedly threatened him to stop appearing on other shows, their anger unabated when he showed them that it was allowed under his contract.</p>
      <p>The station did not immediately respond to inquiries about the firing.</p>
      <p>“I think it makes great radio when people can disagree,” Silverman told the Times. “But something about Trump and impeachment — my colleagues don’t want to discuss it, and they don’t want any disagreements.”</p>
