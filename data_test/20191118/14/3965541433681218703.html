      <p>TACOMA, Wash. - The man suspected of stabbing a Lakewood convenience store owner to death during a robbery has been ordered held at the Pierce County Jail on $2,050,000 bail.</p>
      <p>The suspect, Marcus L. Williams, 24,<a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/family-of-slain-convenience-store-owner-present-at-first-day-of-court-for-suspect"> pleaded not guilty to the murder of In Cha Choe</a>, owner of the McChord Mart, during a court hearing Monday.</p>
      <p>Williams was arrested in Tacoma last week, after a month on the run, when someone tipped off police to his whereabouts and officers took him into custody.</p>
      <p>Williams' bail was initially set at $2 million, but an extra $50,000 was added to that amount after he admitted bringing marijuana into his jail cell. Corrections officers searched the cell more thoroughly and located multiple rolled joints of marijuana, a match, a striker and more loose lead marijuana, officials said.</p>

      <p>Another man suspected of driving the getaway car in the robbery, 20-year-old Bonifacio Alvarez Reynolds, turned himself in earlier last week.</p>
      <p>Investigators say they believe Reynolds waited nearby in a car while Williams went into the store and stabbed Choe to death during a robbery on Oct. 14.</p>
      <p>Murder warrants were issued on Nov. 8 for Williams and Reynolds.</p>
