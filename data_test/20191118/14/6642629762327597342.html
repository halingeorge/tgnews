      <p>War crimes allegedly carried out by the British military may for the first time be investigated by the International Criminal Court (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/icc.html">ICC</a>).</p>
      <p>Killings of civilians in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Iraq.html">Iraq</a> have been covered up by the state, a BBC news programme will report on Monday.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-Kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>'s Ministry of Defence denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>But children were killed, civilians tortured, and British troops were complicit with evidence reportedly contained in a series of leaked documents sourced from within the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT).</p>
      <p>That team, and Operation Northmoor - which investigated war crime allegations in Afghanistan - were shut down by the UK government in 2017 after Phil Shiner, a solicitor who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off from practising law amid allegations he paid people in Iraq to find clients.</p>
      <p>But some former investigators said Shiner's actions were used as an excuse to close down the inquiries.</p>
      <p>No case investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor has led to a prosecution.</p>
      <p>The ICC said it has taken the accusations "very seriously", according to the BBC, whose Panorama: War Crimes Scandal Exposed will be broadcast at 21:00 GMT on Monday.</p>
      <p>"The ICC said it would independently assess the BBC's findings and would begin a landmark case if it believed the government was shielding soldiers from prosecution," the corporation reported on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The ICC previously concluded it was credible that British troops committed war crimes in Iraq related to the mistreatment of detainees.</p>
      <p>The year-long investigation claims to have found evidence of murders by a soldier of the special forces SAS, as well as deaths in custody, beatings, torture and sexual abuse of detainees by members of the Black Watch.</p>
      <p>A senior SAS commander was also referred to prosecutors for attempting to pervert the course of justice, the investigation found.</p>
      <h3>Palpable outrage</h3>
      <p>When allegations of abuses by troops first emerged in the years after the invasion of Iraq, the outrage was palpable. In 2006, a video was published of abuse being carried out two years before - British soldiers grabbing four Iraqi boys off the street and dragging them away for a beating, goaded by the soldier filming.</p>
      <p>In the southern city of Basra, the video sparked mass protests with the burning of Union flags. Back home, there were calls for soldiers' prosecution, but a year later the case was dropped by prosecutors as the statute of limitations expired.</p>
      <p>But after similar stories began to emerge in subsequent years, the media outrage shifted to focus on the prosecutions instead of the abuses. Investigations into soldiers' actions were deemed "witch-hunts" by influential right-wing tabloid newspapers. Former Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/theresa.html">Theresa May</a> blasted "activist, left-wing human rights lawyers" for causing distress to serving and former military personnel.</p>
      <p>When IHAT, set up under a Labour government, was shut down by a Conservative government, only 20 cases were taken forward. The other 3,400 on IHAT's books were shelved indefinitely.</p>
