      <p>The Wales squad to take on the Barbarians will be announced on Tuesday, as the Wayne Pivac era really kicks into gear.</p>
      <p>So, who will new coach Pivac select for the November 30 clash at the Principality Stadium against a Baa-Baas side coached by his predecessor Warren Gatland?</p>
      <p>Which players are available and who is out of the equation?</p>
      <p>Rugby correspondent Simon Thomas outlines what we can expect to see.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When will the squad be announced?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It will be revealed at 11am tomorrow morning and you can follow it live here on WalesOnline.</p>
      <p>There will then be a press conference at 1.30pm at Wales’ Vale Resort base where head coach Wayne Pivac and his assistants Stephen Jones, Jonathan Humphreys, Neil Jenkins and Byron Hayward will be available for interview.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How many players will be in the squad?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As it is a group for just one match, it will be smaller that you would normally see for a Six Nations or autumn international campaign.</p>
      <p>The exact number is not yet confirmed, but it’s set to be in the low 30s.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who is available for selection?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every fit home-based regional player.</p>
      <p>English-based stars, such as Northampton’s Dan Biggar and Saracens prop Rhys Carre aren’t available.</p>
      <p>Under PRL rules, Premiership players can not be released to other countries for matches outside the designated World Rugby Test window.</p>
      <p>The two other World Cup squad members based in England - Liam Williams and Tomas Francis - are both out through injury, so wouldn’t have been available even if the game was inside the window.</p>
      <p>The PRL policy also rules out the likes of Leicester's Jonah Holmes and Sale prop WillGriff John, along with Bristol's in-form Welsh crew, plus Bath's Taulupe Faletau, who is not far off returning to action.</p>

        <figcaption>Liam Williams, Dan Biggar and Tomas Francis are among the English-based players unavailable for the Barbarians match</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Will any players be omitted from the squad as part of their post-World Cup rest period?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>While some frontline players are set to have up to six weeks off between the World Cup and the Six Nations, they won’t necessarily have that in one block.</p>
      <p>Some will have three weeks off, then feature in the Barbarians game and have three more weeks off further down the line.</p>
      <p>The rest periods are decided on a player-by-player basis, taking into consideration how many minutes they played at the World Cup and what shape they are in physically after the gruelling campaign in Japan.</p>
      <p>Generally you are talking 4-6 weeks in total for the leading lights.</p>
      <p>But every fit player will be named in the squad tomorrow and will be available to line up against the Barbarians.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are there any players definitely out of contention through injury?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, there are a few.</p>
      <p>We know Scarlets backs Rhys Patchell and Jonathan Davies are facing four and six months on the sidelines after shoulder and knee surgery respectively.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article17242345.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_escenic-1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Jonathan Davies and Rhys Patchell both face long lay-offs</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Cardiff Blues back rower Josh Navidi and Ospreys winger George North are also unavailable due to the hamstring injuries that cut short their World Cup campaigns.</p>
      <p>Then you’ve got the long-term absentees like Cory Hill, Gareth Anscombe and Ellis Jenkins, while Dragons back rower Ollie Griffiths, who might well have come into contention, is out for a few weeks.</p>
      <p>There may be some doubt over another Dragons breakaway in Aaron Wainwright, who missed the final World Cup fixture against New Zealand with a hamstring problem, although you would expect him to be named in the squad.</p>
      <p>Leigh Halfpenny also missed that match with concussion but is back fit and available for the Barbarians game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will the injured players be kept involved in some way?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, the plan is for a number of the crocked contingent to come into camp at some point next week to get a taste of the new set-up under Wayne Pivac.</p>
      <p>The idea will be to get everyone on board and together in camp for some scene-setting meetings, as the coaching team outline their plans for the future and any new ways of working.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Might we see some players returning to the international fold?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Almost certainly.</p>
      <p>It’s close on two and a half years since Sam Davies won the last of his eight caps, but he must now be in with a real shout of a recall.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article17268870.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Dragons-v-Castres-European-Rugby-Challenge-Cup.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Sam Davies has been calling the shots for the Dragons<cite>(Image: Ben Evans/Huw Evans Agency)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He’s been revitalised this season following his move from the Ospreys to the Dragons and Wales have vacancies at fly-half with Biggar, Patchell and Anscombe unavailable.</p>
      <p>So Davies looks odds on to be selected, along with Jarrod Evans, who has put the disappointment of missing out on the World Cup behind him and has been in fine form for Cardiff Blues these past two weeks.</p>
      <p>You would also expect to see Scott Williams returning, given the injury to fellow centre Jonathan Davies, with Pivac and Stephen Jones well aware of what Williams can do from his time playing under them at the Scarlets.</p>
      <p>Ospreys flanker Dan Lydiate still has a huge hunger to play for Wales and put his hand up in a big way on the weekend with a warrior-like effort against Munster, making 26 tackles and 11 carries.</p>
      <p>Scarlets prop Rob Evans, a surprise omission from the World Cup, was another to send out a timely reminder as Europe kicked off.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The 36-cap loosehead produced a Man of the Match performance in the Challenge Cup victory over London Irish, while his propping team-mate Samson Lee could also come back into the equation.</p>
      <p>Matthew Morgan hasn’t played for Wales for more than four years, but he’s been an excellent recruit for Cardiff Blues and arguably their best player of this season.</p>
      <p>He’s beat more defenders in the opening six rounds of the PRO14 than any other Welsh player and there is potentially a vacancy at full-back with Liam Williams sidelined.</p>
      <p>His regional colleague Seb Davies may come into the frame again too, given his ability to cover lock and back row, with his athleticism to the fore in a try-scoring display from No 8 against Calvisano.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What about some new faces? Any of those in the mix?</b>
      </p>
      <p>There could well be a few uncapped players included.</p>
      <p>Johnny McNicholl and Willis Halaholo aren’t fresh faces as such, both being 29, but this is the first time they have been available to Wales.</p>
      <p>The two Kiwi-born players have just become eligible on the three-year residency rule, so could be brought on board.</p>
      <p>Back three man McNicholl is clearly highly rated by Pivac, who brought him over to the Scarlets from the Crusaders and he is one of the most potent finishers in the business, while Halaholo could provide more depth in the centre.</p>
      <p>As for uncapped youngsters, Scarlets flanker Josh Macleod, 23, has arguably been the stand-out player of the season so far in the regional game, excelling with his work over the ball and his link play.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Taine Basham added to his growing reputation with a hat-trick of tries from the Dragons back row against Castres on the weekend, with Pivac watching on, while Cardiff Blues speedster Aled Summerhill might be a wing option.</p>
      <p>There won't be any new caps handed out however, as it's an uncapped match, in a change from recent meetings with the Barbarians.</p>

      <p>
        <b>When will the players selected in the squad meet up?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The full squad will come in next Monday to begin preparations for the Baa-Baas match.</p>
      <p>But some players will be in with Wales this week for conditioning work to get them back up to speed after a fortnight or so off.</p>
      <p>Others will be doing that work on their own, with all the World Cup squad members having a return-to-play programme laid out for them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How important is this Barbarians game?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s a fixture that has come in for a lot of criticism from regional fans.</p>
      <p>They are unhappy that they will be without their Wales stars on a weekend when there is full round of PRO14 matches, on the back of most of them missing the first two weeks of European action.</p>
      <p>You can understand the frustration.</p>
      <p>But more than 50,000 tickets have been sold for the Baa-Baas match, which will serve as a Principality Stadium farewell to Warren Gatland.</p>
      <p>It’s a key money-making fixture in a year when the WRU have posted a loss of £4.3m due to fewer home internationals.</p>
      <p>It’s also valuable for Pivac as it provides him with an extra week together with his players ahead of the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>In that sense, it will be very useful to him from a preparation point of view and getting to know his new charges, as well as putting a game-plan in place for the first time.</p>
