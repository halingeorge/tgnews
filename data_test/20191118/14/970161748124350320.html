      <p>David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) and Aaron Brennan (Matthew Wilson) may be facing the reality of their vows of ”til death do us part’ when David is left for dead in a brutal hit and run in Neighbours.</p>
      <p>It’s a battle for survival for the young doctor that will see his life balancing on a knife edge. Could Aaron be facing a future alone?</p>
      <p>Aaron has been keeping Ned’s (Ben Hall) underground fighting a secret, but when something piques his guilty conscience, he realises he needs to tell David the truth. His husband reacts exactly how he feared, desperately hurt by the deception. The couple have a row and David storms out, needing to clear his head with a bike ride.</p>
      <p>Could that prove to be a fatal move?</p>
      <p>Despite it being late at night David heads off for his ride, fuming at Aaron’s actions. He continues to seethe as he rides, but his rage distracts him. All of a sudden he finds himself staring at a pair of headlights coming right at him. With nowhere to escape, David is mowed down by the car.</p>

      <p>But who was driving?</p>
      <p>A horrified Terese if the first on the scene and immediately tries to tend to David, although she’ll later be questioned by Paul about what she was doing there late at night. Will her secret drinking be uncovered? Could she have been the one behind the wheel?</p>
      <p>David is rushed to Erinsborough Hospital unconscious where Karl breaks the news to his waiting family that David has lost a kidney. Aaron is crushed. The last conversation he had with his husband was an almighty row, and now he’s fighting for his life. And then things get worse when suddenly David flatlines…</p>

      <p>Kyle spends some much-needed time with Amy after spending far too much time on the class action, but as they step out for some fresh air they discover a broken headlight cover. Kyle confesses to Amy he’d nodded off at the wheel the night before. Could he have been the one to hit David?</p>
      <p>David finally wakes up and appears to be in a stable condition but can’t remember what happened. But when paint from his bike matches the ute it becomes clear who is responsible – it was Kyle after all. And Paul wants revenge.</p>
      <p>But Paul will have bigger worries on his mind when David suddenly takes a turn for the worse. Is David about to die?</p>
