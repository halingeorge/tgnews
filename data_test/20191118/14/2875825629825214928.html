      <p>Dr Dre was sensationally accused of plotting to kill Suge Knight in a murky murder-for-hire conspiracy.</p>
      <p>Fallen music mogul Knight, 54, is currently serving 28 years behind bars after pleading no contest to a voluntary manslaughter charge over a 2015 hit-and-run.</p>
      <p>He was conviction stemmed from an incident in which he crashed his car into two men outside a burger stand in Compton, California.</p>
      <p>Knight was accused of following the pair to the fast food joint after an argument on the set of the film Straight Outta Compton, and intentionally running them over.</p>
      <p>Terry Carter, co-founder of Heavyweight Records, was killed and filmmaker Cle Sloan suffered head and foot injuries but survived.</p>
      <p>The music mogul claimed to have acted in self-defence, and gave birth to the bizarre theory suggesting he'd found himself at the centre of a murder plot.</p>

      <p>Knight claimed former Death Row alum Dre was trying to have him killed over a business deal gone bad.</p>
      <p>When Dre left Death Row records in the 1990s, it was said that Knight had struck a deal to collect 30 per cent of the producer's future earnings.</p>
      <p>If true, it would have meant a major windfall for Knight when the musician signed a lucrative $3 billion deal with Apple over his Beats range.</p>
      <p>Knight alleges that when he tried to collect the cash, Dre decided to "get rid of him".</p>
      <p>He claims Dre was behind a 2014 shooting that left him riddled with gunshot wounds, as well as putting a hit out on him on the day of the burger joint hit-and-run.</p>

      <p>The music mogul even tried to sue Dre over the "murder-for-hire" allegations back in 2016.</p>
      <p>Speaking in his first interview from prison, Knight told The Blast he thinks Dre organised another hit on him because he survived the knightclub shooting.</p>
      <p>He said: "They also got the paper trail with all the checks and proof of when they talked to the witnesses saying that Dre came to them first and asked the two guys how much it cost to get rid of me.</p>
      <p>"And they said, ‘What you mean by get rid of?’ And they said, 'Kill him.'"</p>
      <p>Knight went on to insist the only reason he pleaded no contest in the hit-and-run trial was because his lawyer told him he didn't have the resources to go to trial.</p>
      <p>He added: "So when they gave me an attorney, he seen me two times in eight months and told me he went to the court and said he needed help and other attorneys.</p>

      <p>"And they told him no. He said no way he can do my trial because he really don't know the case and he won't win...</p>
      <p>"So if somebody stacks the deck against you, to the point where they're not trying to fight for you, and let you get the attorneys you wish to have, what can you do?"</p>
      <p>During Knight's 2016 legal battle with Dre, a rep for the rapper/priducter said: "Given that Dre has had zero interaction with Suge since leaving Death Row Records in 1996, we hope that Suge’s lawyer has lots of malicious prosecution insurance.”</p>
