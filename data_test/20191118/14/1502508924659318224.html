      <p>An official of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council said the exporters were demanding an increase in the drawback rates as the government in the last Budget had raised import duty on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold">gold </a>to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent.</p>
      <p>"The government's decision to raise the rates would help in increasing the competitiveness of gold and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/silver">silver </a>jewellery," the official said.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold-jewellery">Gold jewellery </a>during the period has increased about 3 per cent to USD 7.3 billion.</p>
      <p>Silvery jewellery has also jumped to USD 737.7 million from USD 407.9 million during April-October 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Under duty drawback, exporters get a refund of all duty and taxes which were paid for the inputs against the exported products.</p>
