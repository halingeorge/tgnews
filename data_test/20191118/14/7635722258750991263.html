      <h1>Alby Mathewson to bid farewell to Munster this weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:50:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/richiemccormack" target="_blank">Richie McCormack</a></address>

        <b>It's been confirmed that Alby Mathewson's time at Munster will come to an end this weekend. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Kiwi scrum-half joined the province in <a href="https://www.munsterrugby.ie/2018/08/27/munster-sign-alby-mathewson/">August of 2018</a>, originally as injury cover for Conor Murray.</p>
      <p>The 33-year old proved an almost instantly-popular acquisition, especially with his first try coming in a 30-22 Pro 14 defeat to Leinster in October of 2018.</p>
      <p>His original four-month stay turned into fifteen months, with Mathewson retained as cover while Conor Murray was away with Ireland at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.</p>
      <p>Munster have confirmed that Mathewson will have his final involvement with the province in their Heineken Champions Cup pool 4 meeting with Racing 92 at Thomond Park.</p>

      <p>The province have <a href="https://twitter.com/Munsterrugby/status/1196397997443211264?s=20">hailed his impact</a> and how Mathewson got "stuck in from the get-go, and giving everything to the red jersey".</p>
      <p>Mathewson himself added his farewell on Twitter, "Just want to say thank you to the whole [Munster] organization for having me.</p>
      <p>"I’m lucky to have played for such a world-class and historical club.</p>
      <p>"Love my team mates and will miss them a lot.</p>
      <p>"Thanks Limerick for having me. To all the supporters you guys are unreal."</p>
      <p>Mathewson was a second-half substitute for Murray in Saturday's bonus point 32-13 victory away to the Ospreys in round 1 of their Pool 4 games.</p>
      <p>A veteran of Toulon, Bristol, the Blues and the Hurricanes - Mathewson is now tasked with finding a new home for the rest of this season.</p>
