      <h1>Gold erases daily losses on US-China trade headlines, trades above $1,465</h1>

      <p>After falling to $1,456 during the European session, the XAU/USD pair gained traction in the last hour with the precious metal finding demand as a <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdjpy">safe haven</a> on resurfacing fears over the United States and China failing to reach a deal. As of writing, the pair was down only 0.06% on a daily basis at $1,466.20.</p>
      <h3>Trade headlines trigger flight to safety</h3>
      <p>Citing a government source, CNBC's Beijing Bureau Chief, Eunice Yoon, on Monday said China was not optimistic about reaching a trade deal with the US and claimed that China would wait for the impeachment and the election in the US while focusing on supporting its own economy.</p>
      <p>With the initial market reaction, the 10-year US Treasury bond yield fell sharply and was last down nearly 1% on the day. Furthermore, the S&amp;P 500 Futures turned negative on the day to reflect the souring <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">market sentiment</a>.</p>
      <p>The lack of significant macroeconomic data releases from the US will cause investors to stay focused on fresh developments surrounding the US-China trade dispute.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the US Dollar Index stays in the negative territory below the 98 mark on Monday, allowing the risk perception to continue to drive the pair's action.</p>
