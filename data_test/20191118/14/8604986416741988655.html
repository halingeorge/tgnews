      <h1>An Impactful Culture Will Still Have Detractors</h1>
      <h2>When you are creating a culture, it's inevitable that some people will like it and others won't.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:25:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Gimbel</a></address>
      <p>A culture that is impactful will have detractors. Some people like vanilla, others like chocolate. Some prefer mint, others prefer rocky road.</p>
      <p>When you are creating a culture,<a href="https://www.inc.com/tom-gimbel/why-you-want-turnover-in-your-company.html"> being vanilla will prevent people from saying bad things, but it won't stir up much passion either</a>.</p>
      <p>If you have a culture people love, there will most definitely be people who hate it. <a href="https://www.inc.com/tom-gimbel/effective-leaders-are-both-conflict-seekers-conflict-avoiders.html">Either they are jealous and wish they were a part of it, or they don't understand it and think it's either too goofy and silly, or mean and competitive</a>. And that's ok.</p>
      <p>If you are leading people, you have to take a stand for what you believe in. Once that is defined, combine it with passion and compassion, and then set goals, create a plan, and hold people accountable. Once you get started, don't forget these four things (belief, passion, compassion and accountability). Being compassionate while holding people accountable is tough in itself. </p>
      <p>Whether it's a sports team or a sorority, a private club or a business, there are common traits of those who are most successful. Some people already have the traits when they join. Others adapt to the traits and evolve personally and professionally. </p>
      <p>Many will quit because they don't like it, or they're afraid. Others need to be fired because they are pretenders or blatantly dislike what the culture is. That's ok.  </p>
      <p>In this day and age with Glassdoor and Yelp and the anonymous slander which exists on the internet, it's hard sometimes to stay the course. Read them. Know what people think and believe. Some of the bad reviews have truths. Other bad reviews will prove my above theory. "How did someone have that experience?! Why would they lie about how we are?" </p>
      <p>As long as you make sure you are having a positive impact on the majority of the people, you will get this feedback. Remember, America is the best country in the world and 50 percent like one leader/party and 50 percent the other. Some are Yankees fans and others Mets. </p>
      <p>Be true to who you are. Find the people who believe, and hire and retain them. Take chances and get rid of the mistakes. We all make them. The winners admit it and fix them.  </p>
