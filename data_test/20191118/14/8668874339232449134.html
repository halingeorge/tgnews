      <h1>Scottish Rugby confirm All Blacks Test</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:02:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/argentina">Argentina</a> will join <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> as Scotland’s opponents in the 2020 Autumn Tests at BT Murrayfield.</p>
      <p>Scottish Rugby has confirmed that Gregor Townsend’s side will open the campaign against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/pumas">Pumas</a> on the weekend of November 6, followed by the previously announced fixture against the Brave Blossoms a week later.</p>
      <p>The Scots will finish the series against the world’s number-two ranked side, New Zealand, over the weekend of November 20.</p>
      <p>BT Murrayfield is already a 67,000 sell-out for 2020 Calcutta Cup match against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> on February 8 in the Guinness <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> and head coach Townsend is relishing the challenges in the year ahead.</p>

      <p>He said: “Representing your country is the pinnacle of the sport and in 2020 we will have opportunities to pit ourselves against some of the world’s leading teams.</p>
      <p>“To host Argentina, Japan and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> at BT Murrayfield following our games against England and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> in the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> provides fantastic competitive challenges which we look forward to seeing our players embrace.”</p>
      <p>Scotland’s Autumn Test opener against Argentina will be the 19th meeting between the sides, who have won the fixture nine times apiece.</p>

      <p>The Scots have triumphed in the last five encounters, however – the 2016 win sandwiched by home-and-away doubles in 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Scotland fans will remember the 28-21 defeat to Japan in the World Cup Pool A decider in Yokohama, which saw Townsend’s side exit the competition.</p>
      <p>The final Autumn Test against New Zealand will be the first meeting between the sides since <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> came close to a historic first win in 2017, only to lose 22-17.</p>
