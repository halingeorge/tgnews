      <h1>Rockstar Job Advert Suggests Grand Theft Auto 6 Might Launch Next Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:56:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/author/lconnolly/" target="_blank">Lucy Connolly</a></address>

        <b>Fans of <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> believe we might not have too long to wait until the game’s next instalment, thanks to a new job listing on Rockstar Games’ website.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The developer behind the franchise posted the listing for an Animation Systems Programmer on its website recently, which eagle-eyed fans think is directly related to the release of <i>Grand Theft Auto 6</i>.</p>
      <p>Rockstar Games called for an individual to help develop ‘advanced animation systems for large open world character-based games’ in their advert, something which sounds suspiciously similar to the game in question.</p>

      <p>While the job listing doesn’t explicitly say the company is looking to hire someone to work on <i>GTA 6</i>, direct comparisons can be made between that and the game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The advert <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/careers/openings/position/f94dca62">reads</a>:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>We are looking for an experienced, talented engineer to help us in developing advanced animation systems for large open world character-based games.<br/><br/>You should have strong coding skills, a good knowledge and interest in character animation systems, and passion for realistic, high quality character motion.</blockquote>
      <p>According to Rockstar, the successful candidate will ‘work closely’ with gameplay, AI, tools, and art teams and will ‘develop, maintain, extend, and support’ an extensive high-level run-time animation system.</p>

      <p>They will also work alongside a global team of programmers and researchers ‘who collaborate on pushing the boundaries of character animation on next generation hardware’.</p>
      <p>This reference to ‘next generation hardware’ is very likely referring to either the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Scarlett – both of which will launch late next year, hence why fans have made the connection that <i>GTA 6</i> will also launch next year.</p>
      <p>Jim Ryan, the CEO at Sony, confirmed the tech giant is already working with developers on games for the PlayStation 5, telling <i><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-07-sonys-jim-ryan-we-had-to-make-changes-to-deliver-our-ps5-dream">GamesIndustry.biz</a></i> he is ‘particularly optimistic’ about the ease in which developers are able to get the code running on PlayStation 5 – which is ‘way beyond any experience they’ve had on any other PlayStation platform’.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time Rockstar Games has hinted at the possibility that the game might be released shortly; earlier this month, Talent Acquisition Lead Kiran Kumar <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/gaming/gta-6-game-testing-begins-as-fans-think-leak-means-good-news-for-release-date/">posted about a recruitment drive</a> on LinkedIn for game testers at Rockstar India.</p>
      <p>Kumar provided further details via an image included within the post, complete with some gaming artwork in the distinctive style of <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>.</p>
      <p>This call for game testers sparked discussion as to whether the game in question could possibly be the long-awaited <i>GTA 6</i>, suggesting the game is at a playable stage with a potential release date on the horizon.</p>

      <p>As of yet, there has been no confirmation that this recruitment drive and the job listing are in anyway related to <i>Grand Theft Auto 6</i>.</p>
      <p>However, they have given fans fresh hope for a potential 2020 release date.</p>
