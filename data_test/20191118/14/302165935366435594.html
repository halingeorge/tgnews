      <p>BERLIN, Nov 18 — Bundesliga relegation candidates Mainz have announced Achim Beierlorzer as their new head coach, just nine days after the 51-year-old was fired by fellow strugglers Cologne.</p>
      <p>Beierlorzer, who led Cologne to promotion as caretaker coach last season, was sacked earlier this month after a three-game losing run which started with defeat to Sandro Schwarz’s Mainz side on October 25.</p>
      <p>Yet he now replaces Schwarz, who was dismissed by Mainz after a 3-2 home defeat to promoted side Union Berlin a week ago.</p>
      <p>“Achim Beierlorzer is a typical coach for Mainz,” sporting director Rouven Schroeder told the club’s website.</p>
      <p>“He is a meticulous and informed football expert and has a talent for developing a special team spirit.”</p>
      <p>Mainz, a former club of both Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp and Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel, now sit third from bottom in the German top flight.</p>
      <p>Cologne, who sit a place below them, are expected to announce former Hoffenheim and Hamburg boss Markus Gisdol as their new coach later today. — AFP</p>
