      <p>Black Cats boss Parkinson said: "There has been contact between Hibs and Sunderland about John Potter.</p>
      <p>"There is the obvious lure of going back to Scotland for John and if he does go, we wish him all the best."</p>
      <p>The new<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/"> Hibees</a> gaffer is allowed to bring in his own staff <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4957293/hibs-jack-ross-easter-road-three-years/">after penning a three-and-a-half-year deal.</a></p>
      <p>Former Scotland squad keeper Craig Samson is also likely to follow the pair to Leith as goalkeeper coach.</p>
      <p>Ross will take charge of his first game on Saturday against high-flying Motherwell before a visit to his former club St Mirren next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Hibees go into the fixture full of confidence after a 4-1 win over St Johnstone before the international break.</p>
