      <p>The steamy shower scenes are some of the most-talked about moments of I'm A Celeb.</p>
      <p>So it's no wonder Kate Garraway, 52, has packed an extra skimpy costume than usual.</p>
      <p>However, the mother-of-two confessed she was feeling "shy" about stripping off and lathering up for the sizzling scenes in the upcoming days.</p>
      <p>Despite her shyness, the I'm A Celeb star insisted she had packed a "slightly more skimpy" swimming costume than usual so she can "wash".</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/">Hello! magazine</a> : "I'm a bit shy if I'm honest but it is your opportunity to wash so I've got a slightly more skimpy swimsuit, too."</p>

      <p>Myleene Klass kicked off the shower tradition when she slipped her curves into a scanty white bikini in 2006.</p>
      <p>Since then, all the hottest stars of TV have flocked to the shower to pose up a storm for the steamiest of shower scenes.</p>
      <p>It's no wonder she's feeling shy as Kate was coerced into taking part on I'm A Celeb by her children William, 13, and Darcey, 10.</p>

      <p>Kate laid the blame at her kids' door as she explained they are both big fans of the show, having got into watching the last few series.</p>
      <p>She told the publication: "It's all their fault. Darcey really got into the last couple of series and kept saying, 'You should so do this Mum'.</p>
      <p>"And then things like, 'You should eat that slug from the garden or djump offof that wall to practice'."</p>
      <p>Fearing of all creepy crawlies, Kate will tackle the first Bushtucker Trial on Monday Bugged Off.</p>
      <p>She will join forces with the fearless Caitlyn Jenner to try and win food for camp.</p>
