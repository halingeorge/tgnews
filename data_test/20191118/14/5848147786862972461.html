      <h1>Craig McLachlan faces court charged with indecently assaulting four ‘vulnerable’ women</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:05:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/kpercy/" target="_blank">Karen Percy</a></address>
      <p>Prosecutors have outlined details of a series of alleged assaults by actor Craig McLachlan in which he is accused of targeting vulnerable women.</p>
      <p>A three-week contested hearing is underway in the Melbourne Magistrates Court after Mr McLachlan, 54, was charged earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Four women will give evidence over the coming days, but <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/people/2019/04/05/craig-mclachlan-court/">their testimony will be in a closed court</a> — so only lawyers, police and some supporters for complainants will be allowed into the court.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have briefly outlined their case, in which Mr McLachlan is alleged to have indecently assaulted the four women between late April 2014 and mid-July 2014.</p>
      <p>The allegations coincide with the period when he was performing in <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>.</p>
      <p>In all, prosecutors outlined 17 charges against him, including rubbing his penis against complainants, thrusting his groin, grabbing his genitals and kissing them on the mouth and the neck.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Matt Fisher said the women were “vulnerable” and often “isolated and alone”.</p>
      <p>Charge sheets alleged that Mr McLachlan was “aware [she] was not consenting or might not be consenting, or … not giving any thought to whether [she] was consenting or might not be consenting” for each complainant.</p>
      <p>The court heard in one instance, Mr McLachlan approached one of the women, kneeling in front of her and telling her that she was “beautiful and I can’t stop thinking about you”.</p>
      <p>He put his hands to her cheek and “moved to kiss her in a romantic way”.</p>
      <p>The court heard she did not participate in the kiss.</p>
      <p>Later, the court heard, he said to her: “I’m so embarrassed. I made such a fool of myself. I’m such an old fool.”</p>
      <p>One complainant was touched at least 20 times, the court heard.</p>
      <p>He is accused of touching the genitals of one woman and running his hand up the inner thigh of one complainant.</p>
      <p>In that instance, Mr McLachlan “had what was described as a joyful expression on his face and he was laughing”, Mr Fisher told the court.</p>
      <p>The court heard Mr McLachlan had sent a message of apology to one of the women who complained he had held her jaw tightly and pushed her face away.</p>
      <p>There was a photograph of chocolates and a message.</p>
      <p>“Uncle Craig’s been cranky — sorry. It’s not his natural state of being,” the message read, according to Mr Fisher.</p>
      <p>The note ended with the image of a heart.</p>
      <p>But Mr McLachlan’s lawyer, Stuart Littlemore, said his client denied the charges — if there was physical contact at all, it was consensual.</p>
      <p>“There was a kiss. It was not indecent. There was no assault. There was actual consent,” Mr Littlemore said, speaking about one complainant.</p>
      <p>McLachlan is charged with several counts of assault, which Mr Littlemore said were “unparticularised” and should be quashed.</p>
      <p>The contested hearing before Magistrate Belinda Wallington continues.</p>
