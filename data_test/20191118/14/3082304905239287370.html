        <b>A year on from nearly quitting the game, Brendon Todd celebrated a second PGA Tour title in the space of two weeks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brendon Todd continued his fine return to form by winning on the PGA Tour for the second time in a fortnight at the Mayakoba Golf Classic.</p>
      <p>Heavy rain meant no play was possible at all on Thursday, causing delays to the schedule before fading light on Sunday forced a Monday finish in Playa del Carmen.</p>
      <p>Todd was tied with Vaughn Taylor at 20 under par through 14 holes when play was called to set up a tight finale in Mexico.</p>
      <p>A birdie at 15 was quickly followed by a bogey at 16 but a par-par finish was enough for Todd to triumph after a costly dropped shot for Taylor at the 16th.</p>

      <p>Adam Long and Carlos Ortiz each signed for rounds of 66 to join Taylor in finishing one shot adrift of Todd, who also secured the Bermuda Championship this month.</p>
      <p>It marks a brilliant recovery for Todd, who a year ago was contemplating quitting golf after struggling with swing yips. Prior to this calendar year, he had made just six cuts in 47 starts.</p>
      <p>But after regaining his PGA Tour card, Todd has in the space of a month added two wins to the Byron Nelson title he celebrated five years ago.</p>
