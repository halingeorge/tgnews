      <p>Around two years ago, Foton Philippines decided to expand their line of people carriers by bringing in the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/foton-philippines-to-introduce-19-seater-view-traveller-xl.html">Traveller XL</a>. Essentially bigger and longer than the standard Traveller, the Traveller XL can carry more passengers and is also more spacious.</p>

      <p>Now, the automaker has decided to update the Traveller XL by fitting it with new equipment and features. For starters, it now has a 2-DIN touchscreen infotainment system that supports AM/FM radio, Bluetooth, USB, SD card slot, Aux, as well as video playback. This makes for a more entertaining ride for the occupants inside the van.</p>

      <p>Foton also made sure the XL comes with a plethora of safety features. It comes with a reverse camera and rear parking sensors which make it easier to park the large people carrier. In addition, both the driver and front passenger now benefit from a dual airbag system. Anti-lock brakes with electronic brakeforce distribution, along with traction control have been fitted as well for added safety.</p>
