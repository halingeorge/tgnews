      <p>IT is no secret that Malaysia has quite the track record when it comes to human rights violations. Whether it is political persecution, holding prisoners without trial, or (as Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad is famous for) accusing political competition of sodomy and throwing them into solitary confinement on a whim. </p>
      <p>Just last month, Malaysia was called out by Human Rights Watch. This time, the police detained 12 people, including two ruling coalition politicians, for more than two weeks without bail or trial under the draconian Sosma law that Pakatan Harapan has pledged to repeal multiple times. </p>
      <p>So, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that Malaysian fugitive, Jho Low, has been granted asylum by a country that acts in line with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Convention on Human Rights. </p>
      <p>After statements from the prime minister’s spokesman, Kadir Jasin, such as “let’s do a Mossad and get our hands on him,” and “Just dig him out of the worm hole, as promised, and bring him back to Malaysia kicking and screaming,” who wouldn’t conclude that Low would not be granted a fair trial were he to return to his homeland?</p>
      <p>On top of that, it seems pretty ironic that Dr Mahathir and Inspector-General of Police Abdul Hamid Bador, are labelling the asylum-granting country as “irresponsible”, when they are doing the exact same thing with Indian preacher Zakir Naik. </p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir has granted Zakir permanent residency. This is despite that fact that India is desperately seeking the extradition of the man who has been accused not only of money laundering, but of promoting terrorism. </p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir has stated time and time again that “Zakir in general feels that he is not going to get a fair trial (in India),” and that this is reason enough to keep him safe despite outcries from both India and Malaysia. </p>
      <p>If, according to Dr Mahathir, Malaysia has the right to protect Dr Zakir Naik, surely another country has the right to protect Low if they believe that he too will not be afforded a fair trial in his home country?</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir has claimed that Malaysia “won’t go to war over Jho Low”. But what war is he talking about? In essence, Low is now a protected person, much like Zakir. And whether we like it or not, respecting international human rights and the UN is a pretty big deal. – November 18, 2019.</p>
