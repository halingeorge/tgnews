      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/madison-beer/">Madison Beer</a> hit the orange carpet this weekend for the Trevor Project’s TrevorLive charity gala, and she looked nothing short of stunning, as usual.</p>
      <p>Photos shared by <i><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7696691/Madison-Beer-dazzles-plunging-white-gown-features-slit-TrevorLive-gala.html">The Daily Mail</a></i> showed the “Fools” singer attending the event, which celebrates the Trevor Project’s mission to end youth suicide in the LGBTQ community, on Sunday, November 17 in Beverly Hills, California.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old showed off her incredible sense of style as she posed for the slew of paparazzi in a gorgeous white gown that did nothing but favors for her flawless figure.</p>
      <p>Madison’s unique look for the evening was an asymmetrical, Grecian-inspired dress that was made of a sheer white fabric and adorned with sparkling silver accents. It boasted a single, batwing-style sleeve on one side, while the other side was sleeveless, leaving one of the singer’s toned arms completely exposed.</p>
      <p>The garment also featured a deep, plunging neckline that spanned nearly the entire length of Madison’s torso, flashing an ample of cleavage and some serious sideboob as she posed for the cameras.</p>
      <p>Upping the ante of her look was a daring side slit that started high up on her hips, teasing a glimpse of the pop star’s flat midsection and trim waist – though it could have easily revealed even more and made for a serious wardrobe malfunction. The opening also showcased one of Madison’s long, sculpted legs in its entirety, as well as the strappy white heels she added to the look.</p>
      <p>The “Dear Society” singer gave her look some bling by accessorizing with a pair of large hoop earrings and a single cuff bracelet. Her perfectly manicured fingers were also adorned with a slew of statement rings.</p>
      <p>Madison wore her long, brunette tresses down in loose waves that were perfectly parted in the middle, and cascaded behind her shoulders and down her back. She also donned a simple makeup look that included a light pink lip gloss, dusting of matching blush, and thick coat of mascara that made her striking features and piercing brown eyes pop.</p>

      <p>As noted by <i>The Daily Mail</i>, Madison was only one of the many stars that showed up for the event. Posts from the evening shared to the Trevor Project’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trevorproject/">Instagram</a> account also revealed that other guests included Debby Ryan, Jane Lynch, Lance Bass, and Alyson Stoner, among others.</p>

      <p>This is only the most recent case of Madison showing off her incredible fashion sense. A rare Instagram post shared by the singer saw her pulling off a <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5624048/madison-beer-leopard-print-tank-top/">grunge-chic look</a> that included a skimpy leopard-print top and baggy, distressed jeans. The ensemble was quite the opposite of what she sported at last night’s gala, though still was a huge hit with her fans, as the photos have earned over 1.1 million likes and more than 3,500 comments since being shared to her page.</p>
