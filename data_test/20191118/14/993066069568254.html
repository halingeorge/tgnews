      <p>A banner against a Sinn Fein election candidate and his family has been taken down in North Belfast.</p>
      <p>Banners titled "The real Finucane family - human rights abusers" have been erected at a number of locations across the North Belfast constituency where John Finucane is running as a Sinn Fein election candidate.</p>
      <p>One of the banners, located in the Tiger's Bay area, was removed earlier as police attended.</p>
      <p>The banner made allegations against members of Mr Finucane's family, including his father Pat, a solicitor who was murdered by loyalists at the family home in 1989.</p>
      <p>A Sinn Fein spokesman said the banners have been reported to police as hate crime.</p>
      <p>PSNI Superintendent Melanie Jones said officers attended the removal of the banner in Tiger's Bay.</p>
      <p>"Following a request from Belfast City Council, police were in attendance in the Tiger's Bay area of North Belfast this morning to ensure the safety of persons removing a banner from council property on behalf of Belfast City Council," she said, adding that the banners are being investigated.</p>
      <p>"Police have received reports about banners erected in North and South Belfast.</p>
      <p>"Inquiries are under way to establish if these banners constitute any criminal offence or offences, including a hate incident or hate crime."</p>
      <p>Previously Mr Finucane faced criticism for Shankill bomber Sean Kelly being among his team of canvassers in North Belfast.</p>
      <p>Sinn Fein president Mary-Lou McDonald has defended Mr Kelly's role, saying he is a supporter of the peace process and had expressed regret over the 1993 fish shop attack which killed nine Protestants.</p>
      <p>The row comes in a constituency which is expected to see a close result between incumbent Nigel Dodds (DUP) and Mr Finucane at next month's General Election.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the DUP said if the issue has been reported to police then anyone with information should help officers with their inquiries.</p>
      <p>"We are unaware of the matter," he said.</p>
      <p>"If it has been reported to the police then anyone with information should help their inquiries.</p>
      <p>"The DUP consistently condemns violence or anyone inciting hatred. Will SF now condemn those behind the many PIRA murders in North Belfast?"</p>
      <p>Founder of victims group Relatives For Justice Clara Reilly described the banners and posters as "appalling" and called for all political parties to condemn them.</p>
      <p>"All parties should find condemning this outrageous interference in and threat to democracy easy. Indeed it is their duty to condemn these developments; if they do not, they are complicit in this outrage," she said.</p>
      <p>"My thoughts are with the Finucane family whom I have known personally since Pat Finucane was a newly qualified solicitor. They continue to be an inspiration."</p>
      <p>Alliance Party candidate Nuala McAllister is the third of the three candidates running for election in North Belfast.</p>
      <p>The Ulster Unionist Party is not standing a candidate in the constituency in an act of support for Mr Dodds. The SDLP is also not running as part of a pro-Remain arrangement.</p>
