      <p>Chris Hemsworth is already a talented actor, loving husband and devoted family man.</p>
      <p>And now pictures reveal he’s excellent at surfing too.</p>
      <p>If he wasn’t so awesome we would have to hate him.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a> star was spotted riding some waves in his homeland of Australia and looking very cool about it all.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post he revealed he was at Urban Surf in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>Alongside the snaps he wrote: ‘Straight off the plane and into the pool for more waves than I’ve had all year!’</p>
      <p>Chris seems calm and collected as he navigates a huge wave. He even somehow managed to pull a silly face for one photo.</p>

      <p>If that was us we’d have fallen off the surf board and be looking like a total mess by now.</p>

      <p>But you can’t help but adore the Thor actor, especially with all the love he’s been giving out recently.</p>
      <p>Only at the weekend he showed his soft side by sharing an old photo of young Chris and his mum, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/avengers-chris-hemsworth-angel-child-celebrates-mums-birthday-throwback-11166695/">wishing her a happy birthday</a>.</p>

      <p>Absolute angel.</p>
      <p>And earlier in the month Chris was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/chris-hemsworth-cuddling-his-dog-on-the-beach-is-making-our-hearts-melt-11038204/">spotted cuddling his really cute dog on the beach</a>.</p>

      <p>He was out enjoying the sun and fresh air with his whole family – his wife Elsa Pataky and his three children, India Rose, seven and Tristan and Sasha, five.</p>
      <p>Honestly can you get any more perfect than that?</p>
      <p>To top it all off, the 36-year-old bought a house right next to his brother Liam in Broken Head, near Byron Bay to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/14/chris-hemsworth-legend-lending-shoulder-liam-wake-miley-cyrus-split-10567361/">be there for his brother after the shock split from Miley Cyrus</a>.</p>
