      <h1>'Liam Walsh or Lionel Messi' - Everyone's raving about Bristol City loanee's Coventry City wondergoal</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder struck a sensational winner for the Sky Blues</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:47:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>As the majority of Bristol City's squad took in the international break with some rest and recovery, the club's loan army were flying the flag for the club.</p>
      <p>As Joe Morrell excelled <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-midfielder-joe-morrell-3547379">on his competitive debut</a> for Wales against Azerbaijan in Euro 2020 qualification, fellow midfielder Liam Walsh stepped up to add some stardust around St. Andrew's.</p>
      <p>In the sky blue of Coventry City, the 22-year-old collected the ball on half-way in the 72nd minute before dancing and jigging his way through the Rochdale midfield and defence and finishing into the corner.</p>
      <p>It was one of the great solo goals in recent memory and although social media may be a haven for hyperbole, echoed elements of Lionel Messi in its skill and execution.</p>
      <p>Speaking after securing the 2-1 win to move Coventry into third in League One, Walsh was typically modest: "I couldn’t tell you what was going through my mind. I just kept my head down, kept running, I got towards the edge of the box and got my shot off and thankfully I scored.</p>
      <p>"Everyone around me was shouting for the ball, but I thought I’d just have a go myself and luckily it went in."</p>
      <p>But the Scouser didn't need to be over the top in describing what surely is the best goal of his career, as Bristol City teammates and fans did the rest, while Coventry manager Mark Robins labelled it as a work of "genius".</p>

      <p><b>Football Whispers:</b> "Not sure if this is Coventry City's Liam Walsh or Lionel Messi."</p>
      <p><b>Alex Thompson:</b> "The lad's class."</p>
      <p><b>Eddie Wren:</b> "Reminds me of the great George Best."</p>
      <p><b>John Watson:</b> "Awesome goal, he's going to come back even better, look at Taylor Moore. I love the way we recruit and build up."</p>
      <p><b>Colin Sutton:</b> "If Messi had done that the world would have gone into meltdown! Pure class."</p>
      <p><b>Mike Hoban:</b> "Messi must watch that goal and say, 'I’ll never score a goal that good'.</p>
      <p><b>Adam Gibbons:</b> "Arise the Sky Blue Messi, what a goal."</p>
      <p><b>Mark McLauchlan:</b> "Messi wears Liam Walsh pyjamas."</p>
      <p><b>Joe Vry:</b> "That Liam Walsh goal is one of the best goals I’ve seen this year he knew exactly what he was doing."</p>
      <p><b>Bennzky:</b> "To think what our midfield is like now and we still have Liam Walsh and joe morrell to come back next season."</p>
      <p><b>Garrie Coleman:</b> "Good morning. We have Liam Walsh playing for us, not Lionel Messi."</p>
      <p>Walsh is on a season-long loan at Coventry having left Ashton Gate in September and is out of contract in June, 2020.</p>
      <p>Lee Johnson is a known admirer of his talents and reluctantly <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-loan-watch-birthday-3333739">allowed him to leave on loan</a>, knowing how beneficial a full season would be to the midfielder as opposed to giving him sporadic appearances in the Championship.</p>
      <p>City's long-term stance on Walsh is unclear and he'll clearly not be short of offers should be become available, but as his goal against Rochdale showcased, he is a supremely talented individual who it will be a shame to see City let slip through their fingers with minimal impact in BS3.</p>
      <p>Then again, there is always <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/were-massive-club-taylor-moore-3403222">the example of Taylor Moore</a>. The defender spent his early 20s on loan in League One to build his experience and understanding of the professional game and has now forced his way into the first-team reckoning.</p>
