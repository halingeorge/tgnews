      <h1>Africans support Sho Madjozi’s actions after the rest of the world criticised her for what she did to John Cena</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:03:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Observer</a></address>
      <p>Any music fan who is interested in Mzansi Afro-Pop and now international trends will tell you about<a href="https://iharare.com/sho-madjozi-meets-john-cena/"> Sho Madjozi</a>, The South African rural born musician who has now burst into the international scene with her single, John Cena.</p>
      <p>The track has gained international momentum with <a href="https://youtu.be/5oaoxPSIcyY">John Cena himself endorsing</a> the track and even going as far as reciting the song word for word.</p>
      <p>Despite all the hype and trends, Sho Madjozi appeared on Kelly Clarkson ‘s show and revealed that she had never met John Cena. Little did she know that the wrestler was backstage for the surprise of her life.</p>
      <p>In retrospect, one would have noticed that when John Cena appeared behind Sho Madjozi, her overwhelming excitement, she hugged Kelly first before hugging John Cena who was right next to her.</p>
      <p>In many African countries, it is culturally acceptive and expected for a woman to greet her host first and show him or her appreciation before engaging in other guests. Sho Madjozi’s actions might have confused others but she showed her African culture and how she was taught growing up in Limpopo South Africa.</p>
      <p>A lot has been said about how she disrespected John Cena and didn’t recognise him. The topic has been trending all across the globe including America, UK and Australia with the magnitude of Sho’s followers not understanding her actions.</p>
      <p>Despite all the drama and hype, John Cena and Sho have a good vibe going and he (John Cena ) did not give in to pressure from other critics to sue Sho for using his name without permission.</p>
