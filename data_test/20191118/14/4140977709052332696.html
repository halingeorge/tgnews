          <p>During the ninth match of the ongoing second season of the Mzansi Super League between Durban Heat and Cape Town Blitz in Durban, Cape Town Blitz ambidextrous spinner Gregory Mahlokwana yielded success with both hands to put on display his special skills.</p>
          <p>Mahlokwana, who started as an off-spinner to left-hand opening batsman Sarel Erwee, bowled left-arm spin against Heat captain Dane Vilas who is a right-hand batsman.</p>

                      <p>Having registered bowling figures of 3-0-26-2, Mahlokwana was Cape Town’s joint-highest wicket-taker alongside veteran fast bowler Dale Steyn (4-0-23-2).</p>
                      <p>Chasing a 175-run target, the hosts could only manage to score 164/7 in 20 overs. Wihan Lubbe, who scored a praiseworthy 83 (42) with the help of seven fours and five sixes, didn’t receive support from the middle-order yesterday.</p>

                          <p>It was Vilas who won the toss and put Cape Town in to bat early on. In their allotted quota of 20 overs, Blitz posted 174/6 on the back of middle-order batsman Asif Ali scoring 43 (26) with the help of two fours and four sixes.</p>
