      <h1>McDonalds Officially Extends Its Breakfast Hours so You Can Feed Your Hangover</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:20:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>McDonalds breakfasts are a hangover staple and now you'll get an extra 30 minutes in bed/throwing up with the extended brekkie hours.</p>
      <p>After rolling out an <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/mcdonalds-doubles-down-on-extended-breakfast-hours-proving-there-is-a-god-and-he-likes-a-mcmuffin/">expanded trial</a> of a longer breakfast service that <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/06/mcdonalds-is-trialling-extended-breakfast-hours-and-so-help-me-if-you-dont-get-your-arse-down-there/">saw the restaurant doling our breakfast until 11am</a> rather than the usual 10.30am, the big M has made the very sensible decision to implement the new hours as a permanent fixture. For those of who only indulge in a McD's breakfast the morning after a heavy night of drinking, this is positively fantastic news.</p>
      <p>The change will come into effect on Wednesday, November 20, across all 1,249 locations. Obviously, the extended breakfast hours means having to wait an extra 30 minutes for the menu to switch over, but what kind of heathen is trying to get their paws on a burger pre-11am? The kind that can lump it, because we lazy bums want our breakfast to be available for as late as humanly possible.</p>
      <p>In other McDonalds news, the restaurant has recently announced its new innovation on the paper straws front, with the improved tubes being stronger than the old ones - that chief executive Paul Pomroy <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/mcdonalds-uk-boss-says-he-can-keep-a-paper-straw-stiff-for-30-minutes/">claimed he could keep erect for 30 minutes</a>  - and they'll be recyclable this time too, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/mcdonalds-admits-its-paper-straws-cant-be-recycled/">as opposed to the old ones</a>, so now when they collapsing in your mouth, you can take solace in the fact that you've not endured sucking up liquid via a shitty, useless paper cylinder for nothing this time around.  [<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/mcdonalds-is-extending-its-breakfast-opening-hours-starting-next-week-11163322/">Metro</a>]</p>
