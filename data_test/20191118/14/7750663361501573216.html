      <h1>Neil Harris insists he will be his own man amid Neil Warnock comparisons</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neil-harris/"><b>Neil Harris</b></a> has dismissed suggestions that he is "<a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neil-warnock/"><b>Neil Warnock</b></a> Mark II" after being unveiled as Cardiff's new manager.</h2>

      <p>Warnock's three-year stay with the Bluebirds came to an end last week and former <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/millwall/"><b>Millwall</b></a> boss Harris has been labelled as having similar principles based on direct football to his 70-year-old predecessor.</p>
      <p>"I think people are referring to the club I was at previously and the way we played," said Harris, who revealed Warnock had sent him a text congratulating him on his appointment.</p>
      <p>"I was at Millwall who demand getting the ball forward quickly and have physical attributes to the game. Some of those principles I will stick to, but I want to adjust because of how I am as a coach.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there is a Neil Warnock Mark II. He's his own man and I'm respectful towards that. I also have to be respectful of the players I've got and we can't change overnight.</p>
      <p>"There has to be a process to that and it takes time. It is not going to be revolution overnight. I just want to change the culture as we go along, try and build some confidence in the group."</p>
      <p>Harris is <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vincent-tan/"><b>Vincent Tan</b></a>'s seventh manager since the controversial Malaysian businessman bought the Sky Bet Championship club in May 2010.</p>
      <p>Tan is notoriously demanding over performances and results,Â with Cardiff chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mehmet-dalman/"><b>Mehmet Dalman</b></a> saying last week that the owner wanted a side who would have "35 shots on goal" during matches.</p>
      <p>"I've certainly not made any promises about making 35 shots a game," laughed Harris. "I don't know if it's possible to have 35 shots per game!</p>
      <p>"We want to play attack-minded football, press high and win it back high. There's loads of ways to score goals.</p>
      <p>"I'm big on set-plays, which has been a very successful avenue for the club given the players they've recruited over time.</p>
      <p>"The owner and the board are rightly demanding of the football club and want to achieve. You have pressure to succeed from the fanbase and owners."</p>
      <p>Harris, who resigned as Millwall manager last month, has signed a deal until the summer of 2022.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old takes over with Cardiff 14th in the Championship following their Premier League relegation last season.</p>
      <p>Harris managed Millwall for four years, winning promotion to the Championship in 2017, but the former striker is remembered in Cardiff for a 2004 loan spell which was cut short.</p>
      <p>He joined Nottingham Forest in a move that did not go down well with fans at the time.</p>
      <p>"I made a mistake not staying here longer," Harris said. "I mean that in total respect to Nottingham Forest, but at the time I made a family decision for various reasons.</p>
      <p>"It's probably one of the only things I've really regretted in my footballing career so far.</p>
      <p>"But I'm certainly proud and privileged to be sitting here. I have to win people over and I am prepared to do that."</p>
