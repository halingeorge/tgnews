      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - Kuwait’s Jazeera Airways (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/JAZK.KW">JAZK.KW</a>) is unhappy with delivery delays of Airbus (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AIR.PA">AIR.PA</a>) aircraft and has no plans to place an order at this week’s Dubai Airshow, its chief executive said.</p>

      <p>Airbus and Boeing (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BA.N">BA.N</a>) are vying for an order of up to 25 narrowbody jets from the Middle East budget carrier which now expects to place an order by the middle of next year.</p>
      <p>“We have no plans to make an order announcement at the air show,” Rohit Ramachandran told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow.</p>
      <p>The Airbus A320 operator says production issues have delayed the delivery of new aircraft this year, forcing it to push back some route launches this year.</p>
      <p>“We are not happy with the delays that are occurring in the production line and I think Airbus is very aware of our position,” Ramachandran said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see a major improvement. I think they continue to have unplanned delays in production,” he said.</p>
      <p>Airbus last month cut its full-year delivery goal for commercial jets, as the planemaker wrestles with production issues.</p>
      <p>Jazeera, whose fleet will expand to 13 jets this year, has been considering placing an order for over a year. It has consistently pushed back potential deadlines on when it could sign a deal and its CEO said it was in no rush.</p>
      <p>“We want to make our shareholders rich, not Boeing and Airbus shareholders rich,” said Ramachandran.</p>
      <p>An order could be worth around $3 billion at list prices, depending on which aircraft are ordered, but it is common for airlines to receive discounts.</p>
      <p>Any order could include longer range narrowbody jets like the Airbus A321XLR, Ramachandran said.</p>
      <p>Airbus and Boeing said they are mostly sold out of the latest versions of their workhorse single-aisle jets until 2024 after selling thousands in recent years.</p>
      <p>“If we really put money on the table, we are confident we will be able to get aircraft in a timely manner,” said Ramachandran, who wants to start receiving new aircraft in 2022.</p>
      <p>Jazeera, one of the Middle East’s few listed airlines, expects to carry just under 3 million passengers this year.</p>
