      <p><b>ROME —</b> Former UEFA president Michel Platini has slammed the use of VAR technology, the introduction of which he has always opposed, as a total nightmare, in an interview on Italian television.<br/><br/>"It would take half an hour to explain why it doesn't solve problems," the former France international told the "Che tempo che fa" late-night talk show on Rai on Sunday.<br/><br/>"It shifts them. I'm against VAR. I think it's a load of crap and unfortunately we will not go back."<br/><br/>The 64-year-old has always been against the use of VAR which he refused to consider after he became UEFA chief in 2007.<br/><br/>European football's governing body has now also introduced the use of the video replay technology in this year's Champions League.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the former Juventus star believes he could still play a role in football after his four-year suspension from the sport ended in October.<br/><br/>"At 64, I have the opportunity for one last adventure, but I have no room for error and I have to think about it," he said.<br/><br/>A triple Ballon d'Or winner, Platini had been expected to succeed Sepp Blatter as FIFA president in 2016 but fell spectacularly from grace a few months earlier.<br/><br/>The former France captain was suspended by world football's governing body in 2015 over a controversial payment of two million Swiss francs (1.8 million euros, $2 million) that he received from Blatter.<br/><br/>Platini has always insisted he did nothing wrong.<br/><br/>"At FIFA, they did not want me as president," he continued.<br/><br/>"I wanted to defend football and I was the only footballer who could become FIFA president."<br/><br/>Platini added that he no longer had any contact with either Blatter or current FIFA president Gianni Infantino. — AFP</p>
