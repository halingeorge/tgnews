      <p>Jay-Z and Beyonce’s daughter Blue Ivy Carter has won a songwriting award at the age of seven.</p>
      <p>Blue Ivy bagged the Ashford &amp; Simpson Songwriter’s Award at Sunday’s Soul Train Awards for co-writing her mother’s hit Brown Skin Girl, a song celebrating dark- and brown-skinned women.</p>
      <p>Blue Ivy gives a vocal performance that opens and closes the song, which also features Wizkid and Saint Jhn.</p>
      <p>The Carters were not at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas to accept the honour named after the legendary Motown songwriting duo Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson.</p>
      <p>Blue Ivy shares the win with Beyonce, Jay-Z, St Jhn and several other co-writers.</p>

      <p>This week could get even better for Blue Ivy.</p>
      <p>Grammy nominations will be revealed on Wednesday and Brown Skin Girl could earn the young star her first Grammy nomination (Beyonce has won 23 Grammys and Jay-Z has 22).</p>
      <p>Brown Skin Girl, which features Beyonce namedropping Lupita Nyong’o, Naomi Campbell and Kelly Rowland and singing lyrics like, “I love everything about you, from your nappy curls to every single curve”, was also nominated for best collaboration at the Soul Train Awards.</p>
      <p>Most of the top winners did not attend the show, and only three of the 12 awards were handed out during the live telecast: best female R&amp;B/soul artist (H.E.R.), best new artist (Summer Walker) and best gospel/international award (Kirk Franklin).</p>
