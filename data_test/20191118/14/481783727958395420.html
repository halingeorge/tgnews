      <h3>Digital roles disappearing as big companies restructure</h3>
      <p>Multinational companies are turning to new marketing structures as part of their transformation, moving away from traditional functional and hierarchical approaches in favour of organising around the customer experience.</p>
      <p>More than one in four (42%) now regularly work in cross-functional teams, while 30% work in self-organising agile teams. Half say they sometimes have agency staff embedded in their teams.</p>
      <p>The research, which spoke to more than 20 multinationals with a total global ad spend of $32bn, also found that 10 companies still have a separate team for digital marcoms, with just seven saying digital expertise is woven into all teams. However, 10 companies said they are working to ensure the latter.</p>

      <p>More than half (58%) of marketing professionals believe their chances of being selected for a job have been lowered because of an identifying factor such as their age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or religion.</p>
      <p>This is higher than the 52% who feel this has happened in the UK overall.</p>
      <p>In marketing, 55% feel their chances of selection have been lowered due to their age, 41% because of their ethnicity or nationality, and 37% because of their gender or gender identity. The majority (55%) said this had happened in the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>They also believe career progression has been limited, with 51% saying this is because of age, 37% because of their ethnicity and 43% on the grounds of their gender or gender identity.</p>

      <p>Poor customer service and a lack of staff understanding are among the reasons preventing disabled consumers from purchasing goods and services.</p>
      <p>Three-quarters (75%) of disabled people have had to leave a store or website unable to go through with their purchase because of their disability. Yet there are simple things businesses can do to improve the experience for disabled customers.</p>
      <p>These include improving staff understanding of different disabilities (56%), the overall customer experience for disabled people (41%), store accessibility (41%) and website accessibility (16%).</p>
      <p>More than one in three (34%) of disabled people said poor customer service prevented them from making a purchase, while 33% blamed a lack of staff understanding about their needs.</p>

      <h3>Supermarket sales slow as political uncertainty and wet weather hit</h3>

      <p>Supermarket sales were up by just 1% year on year in the 12 weeks to 3 November, slower than last year, against a backdrop of political uncertainty and warm and wet autumn weather.</p>
      <p>There was also an increased focus on seasonal events and promotions, with consumers’ attention already turning to Christmas. Supermarkets sold £17m worth of mince pieces and £3m worth of Christmas puddings.</p>
      <p>Co-op’s growth continues to outpace the market, with sales up 4.4% and its market share rising to 6.5%. Lidl was the fastest growing grocer with sales up 8.8% ahead of Aldi with sales growth of 6.7%.</p>
      <p>However, the big four supermarkets struggled, with sales at Asda down 1.2% and Morrisons’ sales falling 1.7%. Sainsbury’s experienced a fall of 0.2% and Tesco 0.6%.</p>

      <h3>Half of marketers confident consumer trust in brands is improving</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://marketingweek.imgix.net/content/uploads/2019/11/18134110/Half-of-marketers-confident-consumer-trust-in-brands-is-improving.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=60&amp;w=736&amp;h=414&amp;q=10"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Nearly half of marketers (49%) believe consumer trust in how brands handle their data has improved, while 46% state that trust has increased in brands and their marketing, and 44% in businesses in general.</p>
      <p>The reason for this is widely believed to be new data privacy laws, which have reframed the relationship between organisations and their customers.</p>
      <p>However, there are concerns Brexit could impact this. Almost three-quarters (72%) of marketers are concerned about the financial impact of difficulties in exchanging data between the UK and EU post-Brexit. And the majority of marketers (78%) want to retain access to the digital single market after the UK leaves the EU.</p>
