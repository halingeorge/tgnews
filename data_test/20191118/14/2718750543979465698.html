      <p><i>The Death and Live of John F. Donovan </i>is finally making its way to a theatrical release after debuting at the Toronto International Film Festival last year and existing as an idea for what feels like a lifetime. From writer and director <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/12/xavier-dolan-on-his-new-film-critics-and-more.html">Xavier Dolan</a>, <i>Donovan </i>centers on a young boy named Rupert (Jacob Tremblay) who becomes pen pals with a Hollywood star (Kit Harington). No one believes the boy when he says he’s exchanging letters with a big celebrity, not even his mom (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/natalie-portman-vox-lux-interview.html">Natalie Portman</a>), but the correspondence has a big impact on both of their lives. “This is about us as a society, what we want, what we seek,” says grown-up Rupert (Ben Schnetzer) to someone who looks like a journalist (Thandie Newton). There’s also Susan Sarandon, Michael Gambon, Kathy Bates, and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/schitts-creek-netflix-pop-success-story.html"><i>Schitt’s Creek</i></a>’s own Emily Hampshire, but there is sadly <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/jessica-chastain-cut-out-of-xavier-dolans-john-f-donovan.html">no Jessica Chastain</a> because Dolan had to cut her part from the film. Yeah, that’s a lot, so just watch the trailer above. <i>The Death and Live of John F. Donovan </i>will arrive in theaters and on demand December 13.</p>
