        <b>It’s been a difficult few months for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/daniel-osbourne/">Daniel Osbourne</a> (Rob Mallard) in Coronation Street, after wife Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn) died as a result of her cancer diagnosis. Understandably, he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/coronation-street-spoilers-whats-next-for-daniel-as-he-deals-with-life-without-sinead-11003993/">struggled to adjust to life without his wife</a>, and thus <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/coronation-street-spoilers-daniel-osbourne-kisses-bethany-platt-as-wife-sinead-dies-10915564/">he departed Weatherfield</a>. However, Sinead’s funeral arrives tonight, and he decides to return to the cobbles as a result.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After Ken (William Roache) and Claudia (Rula Lenska) failed to track Daniel down in Scotland, Peter (Chris Gascoyne) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/coronation-street-spoilers-peter-barlow-tracks-daniel-osbourne-home-11149786/">discovered that he was staying in Chesire, and thus attempted to make him come home</a>.</p>
      <p>He ultimately failed to do so, but his words clearly got through to Daniel, as — with Sinead’s funeral set to take place — the young man returns to the cobbles during tonight’s episode.</p>
      <p>With Sinead having been a much-loved resident of the Street, her funeral will no doubt be a highly emotional affair as all those who dwell in Weatherfield gather to bid her farewell.</p>

      <p>Daniel’s troubles are set to persist as ± in addition to bidding adieu to the love of his life — he also faces another trauma this evening, as a burglar rifles through his things at the flat.</p>
      <p>Later, Peter and Carla (Alison King) discover that Daniel’s laptop — the one in which Sinead recorded her video messages for both he and Bertie — is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/coronation-street-spoilers-daniel-osbourne-arrested-explosive-accusation-11077276/">among the items stolen</a>.</p>
      <p>How <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/coronation-street-spoilers-daniel-osbourne-broken-after-losing-final-memories-of-sinead-tinker-in-cruel-twist-10956867/">will the young man react to this discovery</a>?</p>
