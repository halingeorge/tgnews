      <p>“I understand people not wanting to do it,” Lopez says. “Everybody has to make their own choices. They have to feel good about what they’re doing.</p>
      <p>“I feel like it’s an amazing platform and one of the biggest in the world to put out whatever message you want to put out there. Whatever message of love or—I don’t want to give anything away—I think it’s taking a chance to do it. I feel that it’s a great thing to have two Latina women in Miami headlining the Super Bowl, and what we could do with those 12 to 14 minutes to make people understand our worth and value in this country… I think it could be a really beautiful celebration.”</p>
      <p>A number of stars, including Rihanna, have reportedly turned down the halftime show in support of Colin Kaepernick’s protest for criminal justice reform.</p>

      <p>Talking about “Hustlers”, Lopez reveals that she didn’t actually make any money for acting in the film.</p>
      <p>“I do things because I love them. I didn’t get paid a whole bunch of money for <i>Hustlers</i>,” she sas. “I did it for free and produced it. I bank on myself. That’s the Jenny From the Block. I do what I want, I do what I love.”</p>
      <p>Lopez also talks about being a middle-aged woman in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>“Women in general, and especially artists, get so much better as they grow and mature. You can see it!” she says. “Meryl Streep’s career took off after she was 40. Tina Turner after she was 40. Cher…As they got older they blossomed in a way they hadn’t before, right? They came into their own power…There’s no reason to ever be ashamed of where you’re at. Not when you’re doing your best. Don’t call it a comeback, I’ve been here for years!”</p>
      <p>Speaking about the word she hates hearing, Lopez says, “I’m incredibly impatient. I want everything now. It’s hard for me to tolerate a slow pace. I get annoyed with it. I don’t like the word ‘no.’ Like really bad. Really bad.”</p>
