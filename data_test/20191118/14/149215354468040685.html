      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wants President Trump to testify in the impeachment inquiry, and he's not shooting down the idea.</p>
      <p>Pelosi on Sunday <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-on-face-the-nation-november-17-2019/">invited Trump to testify</a> in the ongoing probe focused on whether he abused his power by pushing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, with the Democratic leader saying he "could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants" and "could do it in writing."</p>
      <p>In a tweet Monday morning, Trump at first lashed out at Pelosi, only to actually decide this isn't such a bad idea after all, promising he will "strongly consider" testifying.</p>

      <p>Still, many were skeptical that Trump's supposed consideration will actually lead to anything, especially <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/397756-trump-on-possible-sit-down-with-mueller-ive-always-wanted-to-do-an">after he said</a> he "wanted" to sit down for an interview with former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, only to never do so. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/24/20726376/mueller-testimony-trump-interview-maloney">Mueller later testified</a> that his team spent more than a year negotiating for an interview with the president but had "little success." Trump, instead, provided written answers to Mueller, but the former special counsel told Congress this was "certainly not as useful as the interview would be."</p>
      <p>Regardless of whether this testimony will ultimately happen, though, <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1196426390997999617"><i>Politico</i>'s Jake Sherman asked</a> "how long Dems will give the president to do this" and wondered "could this delay their probe," <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1196426601661128704">also writing</a> that "whether he does or not, there's an argument now they have to give him a reasonable timetable."</p>
