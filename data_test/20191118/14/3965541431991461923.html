      <h1>Inslee, Brown meet to revive I-5 bridge replacement</h1>

      <p>VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed an agreement Monday to work together to replace the Interstate 5 Bridge that connects their two states.</p>
      <p>The Columbian reports that the governors’ action reinvigorates a goal to replace the twin spans, which opened in 1917 and 1958.</p>
      <p>The two-page memorandum of intent signed by the two governors takes effect immediately and lasts for five years. It makes a handful of commitments, including opening a joint Oregon-Washington project office that will re-evaluate the purpose and need and permits for the failed Columbia River Crossing project and evaluating the scope of the project, as well as a schedule and budget for replacing the bridge.</p>
      <p>A draft report by the project office, is scheduled to be released to the two states by Dec. 1, with a final report by Dec. 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>Inslee called the bridge an “arterial for the economies and the lives of the entire states of Washington and Oregon.”</p>
      <p>“We know it is mandatory we replace this bridge,” he said. “We do not have an option. This bridge has to be replaced.”</p>
      <p>Brown said her top two priorities are to build an earthquake-resilient bridge with high-capacity transit.</p>
      <p>“We have to invest in the bedrock of our states’ economies, and that’s infrastructure,” she said. “When working properly, infrastructure goes unnoticed. But without it, we are literally in for a bumpy ride.”</p>
      <p>The Columbia River Crossing started in 2004 as a bi-state megaproject. The project came to a halt in 2013 when Washington lawmakers decided not to pay their share.</p>
