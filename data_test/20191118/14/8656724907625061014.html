      <h3>Huawei warnings before you update</h3>
      <p>However there are some issues Huawei warns about if you are to update to the lastest EMUI 10. It warns that some banking apps may not be compatible with Android 10 and this issue can be resolved only after a compatible app version is released. Some Instant messaging apps like Messenger, WhatsApp or Skype may also not be compatible with Android 10 and users might encounter issues when sending images. In order to fix this all you need to do is to restart the app.</p>
      <p>When you install EMUI 10 on your Huawei phone, it should be noted that silent mode is enabled by default for notifications from instant messages if you disabled sound and vibration alerts for them before installing the latest update. The alert mode can be easily be modified in the app settings according to the user’s preference.</p>
      <p>If you use the App twin feature in apps like WhatsApp and Messenger, you should note that this update will allow the twin app to read messaging content and to fix this issue just disable and re-enable the App twin feature to fix this.</p>
      <p>Huawei also warms that EMUI 10 might cause the screen to flicker in certain sitations when playing PlayerUnkown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG). Users might have to set to a non-HDR resoltion or restart the game to fix the issue.</p>
      <p>Finally Samsung smartwatch users might experience automatic disconnection from the phone after a certain period and Huawei has promised to fix this in a later version.</p>
      <h3>New EMUI 10 features</h3>
      <p>As we <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/a-first-look-at-emui-10-user-interface/">have seen before</a> EMUI 10 comes with many features.</p>
      <h4>Magazine Style User Interface (UI)</h4>
      <p>There is a new Magazine Style that has made it’s maiden appearance in EMUI 10, it basically arranges the screen in a lay out similar to a Magazine. There have been some aesthetic changes at the top which are bigger and pull the icons lower for reachability, although not as drastic as Samsung’s One UI. This leaves more White space, allowing a balance between interactive and informative content.</p>
      <h4>Colorful Always on Display (AOD)</h4>
      <p>Samsung pioneered the use of an Always-On Display feature thanks to its advanced use of AMOLED screen technology. AoD allows users to make changes to their phone’s lock screen to show time, date, battery status, notifications and more while the screen is off.</p>
      <h4>Whole new EMUI 10 Dark Mode</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Dark Mode will be really dark in EMUI 10– as it has been revamped to be system wide and will add a new layer of experience.</p>
