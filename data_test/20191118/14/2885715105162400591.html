      <p>Much to the surprise of others, Vijay Sethupathi on Sunday revealed that he had to pass on a role in Indian 2. Speaking at Ungal Naan, a concert headlined by Ilaiyaraaja to celebrate 60 years of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kamal-haasan/">Kamal Haasan</a> in the film industry, Makkal Selvan openly requested Ulaganayagan to give “another chance” to work with him.</p>
      <p>He said, “Kamal Haasan has never cheated his fans. His films always offer a quality cinema experience,” adding he “loved cinema but now forayed into politics for a reason.”</p>
      <p>Vijay Sethupathi also confessed he believes in Kamal Haasan’s ideologies as a politician. “I very much like the logo and the party name, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-does-makkal-needhi-maiam-mean-kamal-haasan-new-party-name-symbol-flag-5073149/">Makkal Needhi Maiam</a>,” he said.</p>
