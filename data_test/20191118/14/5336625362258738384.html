      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:32:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/joseph-green/" target="_blank">Joseph Green</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> The <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdpf">Philips HD9220/20 air fryer</a> is on sale for £99.99 on Amazon, saving you 50% on list price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Amazon is counting down the days to its Black Friday sale with its "Countdown to Black Friday Sale." It's not the most imaginative title we've ever seen, but you get the idea.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can now save on a wide range of products from some of the biggest brands, and whilst we're expecting most of the best deals to drop closer to Nov. 29, you can still pick up a bargain if you look closely.</p>
      <p>There are a number of deals to consider, but perhaps the most impressive is the discounted <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdpf">Philips HD9220/20 air fryer</a>. This device is usually listed at £200, but is now available for just <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdpf">£99.99 on Amazon</a>. This half-price deal doesn't have a deadline, so it's unlikely to drop any further.</p>
      <p>When it comes to Black Friday, it often pays to be patient, but when you're presented with a 50% discount without a deadline, we recommend making the most of the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Get ahead of the crowds and save on this Philips air fryer.</p>
