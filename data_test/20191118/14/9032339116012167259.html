      <p>Afterwards, you will be able to enjoy an exclusive, private tour of the Stately Rooms at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>This unique opportunity is special even for the Plum Guide’s standards, which are so high that the brand only accepts the top one per cent of luxury homes. Bookings for this stay are available on a limited, first-come, first-served basis for a minimum of one week.</p>
      <p>Starting at £50,000 (about $64,800), the price reflects the highly luxurious experience, but for Royal enthusiasts wanting to get as close as they can to the Queen’s lifestyle, it’s certainly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
