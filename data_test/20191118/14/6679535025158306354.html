      <p>DINDIGUL</p>
      <p>A young couple, who had an inter-caste marriage, sought police protection from the Superintendent of Police here on Monday. They stated that they were facing threats from the parents and relatives of the girl who belongs to an intermediate caste.</p>
      <p>“We got married in 2018 and I was living with the family of my husband in Gujiliamparai. As my husband belongs to Scheduled Caste, our parents objected to our marriage and after a few days, my parents and relatives from Karur, arrived at his home with weapons and took me back to my home by force,” said the girl.</p>
      <p>“I escaped from my home last week and we are now living in different places to avoid trouble from my parents. We have already submitted petitions to the police and no action has been taken,” she said and sought protection.</p>
