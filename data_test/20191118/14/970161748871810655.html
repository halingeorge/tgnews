        <b>Deontay Wilder believes that Andy Ruiz has the beating of Anthony Joshua and their rematch will have a similar result to their first fight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ruiz produced a monumental upset when he stopped Joshua in the seventh round of their first bout in June, taking the IBF, WBA, WBO and WBO heavyweight titles away with him from Madison Square Garden.</p>
      <p>The pair meet again on 7 December in Saudi Arabia as the Brit tried to reclaim his straps, but Wilder cannot see the Destroyer relinquishing his gold.</p>
      <p>Ahead of his own rematch against Luis Ortiz this weekend, Wilder was asked who he was backing in the Saudi scrap, to which he replied: ‘Andy Ruiz.</p>
      <p>‘I liked him in the first fight with Joshua and I like him in the second fight as well.</p>
      <p>‘In my opinion, it’s an even more bigger fight between the two, you know. Especially how he won the first time.’</p>

      <p>Wilder plans to beat Ortiz for the second time when they clash on Saturday and then take on Tyson Fury in another rematch in February.</p>

      <p>The Bronze Bomber and the Gypsy King fought to a classic draw last December and will do battle for Wilder’s WBC title once again, as long as he avoids defeat against Ortiz.</p>
      <p>A Wilder vs Joshua clash looked likely at one stage last year, but never materialised and now could be a long way from ever being put together.</p>
      <p>The American has often voiced his frustrations with how difficult the negotiations were with AJ’s camp, but believes he has a more exciting fight ahead of him against King Kong.</p>
      <p>‘With Joshua we tried many, many, many times to get that fight to unfold, to make that dream fight happen for the fans.’ said the unbeaten WBC champ.</p>
      <p>‘To unify the division and have one champion. As you can see, that was a long process, a process where, you know, we had different mile markers being stretched.</p>
      <p>‘Once we completed (one mark), we had to do something else, do this, do that, you know what I mean. It was a lot.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a gladiator’s sport, it’s a man’s sport. I’m a man and I don’t have time for games. Being that Ruiz is under the same stable as I… it’s a much easier fight to make, and in my opinion a much more exciting fight.’</p>

      <p>Wilder vs Ortiz II will be held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday night after their first bout ended in a 10th round TKO win for the Bronze Bomber last March.</p>
