      <p>That would certainly be an interesting story element to play with and it stays true to stories that have been told in the comics.</p>
      <p>There was a female version of Loki that played a part in 2009’s <i>The Mighty Avengers</i>. In that story arc, Loki was reborn as a woman and in that state used the opportunity to manipulate the heroes by posing as the Scarlet Witch and ended up forming her own team of Avengers as part of the "Dark Reign" storyline.</p>
      <p>There’s no word on how this version of the female Loki will play into the series, but I'm looking forward to finding out!</p>
      <p>This series is set after the events of<i> Avengers: Endgame</i> and follows the adventures of Loki after having escaped with the Tesseract. According to reports, he will be traveling through different periods of time while affecting several important moments of history. </p>
      <p>I’m intrigued by the concept of this show and it’s going to be cool to see how the story turns out! Loki is such a beloved character in the MCU and I imagine this series is going to make us love him even more!</p>
