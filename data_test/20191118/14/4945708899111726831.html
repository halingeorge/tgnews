      <h1>AI could transform how we monitor the structural health of civil infrastructure</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:04:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author">University of Surrey</a></address>
      <p>The University of Surrey and King's College London have developed a new machine learning algorithm (AI) that could transform the way we monitor major infrastructure—such as dams and bridges.</p>
      <p>In a paper published by the journal <i>Structural Health Monitoring</i>, researchers from Surrey and Kings detail how they created an AI system named SHMnet to analyze and assess the damage of bolt connections used in metallic structures.</p>
      <p>Built on the foundations of a modified Alex-Net neural network, the research team set up an impact hammer <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/test/">test</a> under lab conditions and tasked SHMnet with accurately identifying the subtle condition changes of connection bolts on a steel frame under 10 damage scenarios.</p>
      <p>The team found that when SHMnet is trained using four repeated datasets, it had a flawless (100 percent) identification record in their tests.</p>
      <p>Dr. Ying Wang, the corresponding author of the paper and Assistant Professor at the University of Surrey, said:</p>
      <p>"The performance of our <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/neural+network/">neural network</a> suggests that SHMnet could be incredibly useful to <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/structural+engineers/">structural engineers</a>, governments and other organizations tasked with monitoring the integrity of bridges, towers, dams and other metal structures.</p>
      <p>"While there is more to do, such as testing SHMnet under different vibration conditions and obtaining more <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/training+data/">training data</a>, the real test is for this system to be used in the field where a reliable, accurate and affordable way of monitoring infrastructure is sorely needed."</p>
