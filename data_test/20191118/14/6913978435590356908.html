      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>AL-ULA —</b> Prince Badr Bin Abdullah Bin Farhan, Minister of Culture and governor of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula (RCU) recently inspected the main development projects and infrastructure in Al-Ula province.<br/><br/>The main development projects come within the first phase of infrastructure projects in the province according to the Kingdom's Vision 2030 to enhance tourism and develop the quality of life.<br/><br/>Prince Badr reviewed the infrastructure projects, which are being carried on according to the vision of Al-Ula, launched by Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman, chairman of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula Province. Prince Badr also met with engineers and supervisors of the projects, and was briefed on the stages of completion.<br/><br/>The transformation of Al-Ula’s Prince Abdulmajeed Bin Abdulaziz Airport and the Maraya Concert Hall has begun and will be completed by the end of this year. A long-term tree-planting initiative in Al-Ula has also been launched in alignment with the vision.<br/><br/>The airport development project will transform Al-Ula’s domestic airport into an aviation hub developed in line with international standards that can welcome guests from around the world with an increase in capacity from 100,000 passengers to over 400,000 a year, marking an important step in the RCU’s overall aim to accommodate two million tourists by 2035.<br/><br/>Development of the airport will include construction of an extended apron area that can accommodate more aircraft. A new executive lounge will also be constructed, new digital information systems will be added to both the departure and arrival areas, and further interior and exterior design changes will be made to the terminal buildings using local material from Al-Ula.<br/><br/>With a new taxiway already planned for completion in quarter one of 2020 to meet the growing demand for efficient and easy access to Al-Ula, this transformation will ensure the airport can host future international flights and allow direct access from regional and other potential global destinations.<br/><br/>The structural improvements and renovations to be made to the Maraya Concert Hall, the venue for the Winter at Tantora Season, will result in a larger, permanent facility, seating over 500 people, based around a more refined design. The acoustics are being upgraded to operatic performance quality, a 500-seat restaurant is being created, along with an art exhibition space and a new rooftop terrace feature.<br/><br/>The mirrored walls of the structure, designed to form an extension of the environment by reflecting abstract views of the surrounding golden sands and mountains, will remain an integral part of the concert hall’s design, which is the basis for its name as Maraya means mirror in Arabic.</p>
