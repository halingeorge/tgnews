      <p>HARLEM, Manhattan (WABC) -- Police are looking for two men who they say posed as the superintendent of a building and forced their way into an apartment.</p>
      <p>They say the suspects, who were wearing masks, then pistol-whipped and robbed the victim who lived there.</p>
      <p>The attack happened in broad daylight at 1 p.m. on Thursday in a fourth-floor apartment on Frederick Douglass Boulevard.</p>
      <p>One of the suspects got past first floor-security, they knocked on the apartment door. The victim then opened the door, and the two men forced themselves inside while showing a gun, pistol-whipped the 40-year-old victim, demanding to know where jewelry and money was.</p>
      <p>As quickly as the attack started, it ended with the two men taking off with a backpack. Inside the bag were headphones, phone chargers and personal papers - but no cash or jewelry.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating whether the attack was random or targeted.</p>
