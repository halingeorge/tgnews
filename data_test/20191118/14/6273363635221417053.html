      <h1>T-Mobile CEO Legere will be replaced by COO Sievert in May 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:16:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/jeremy/" target="_blank">Jeremy Horwitz</a></address>
      <p>T-Mobile’s iconic CEO John Legere will leave the company when his contract expires on April 30, 2020, the cellular carrier <a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Mike-Sievert-to-Succeed-John-Legere-as-CEO-of-T-Mobile-on-May-1-2020/default.aspx">announced</a> today, to be replaced by COO and president Mike Sievert on May 1. The carrier says the transition has been planned and Sievert will continue <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/05/t-mobile-to-offer-subscribers-stock-and-other-freebies-in-next-un-carrier-move/">Legere’s “Un-carrier” strategy</a>, which has been highly successful in establishing the company as a true competitor to larger cellular carriers Verizon and AT&amp;T.</p>
      <p>“John Legere has had an enormously successful run as CEO,” said T-Mobile US board chair Tim Höttges. “As the architect of the Un-carrier strategy and the company’s complete transformation, John has put T-Mobile US in an incredibly strong position. I have the highest respect for his performance as a manager, and as a friend I am very grateful to him for the time together … The board is pleased that John will support this leadership transition while focusing on closing our pending acquisition of Sprint.”</p>
      <p>The news unexpectedly comes in the middle of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/05/fcc-approves-t-mobile-sprint-merger-after-rapid-5g-coverage-pledges/">T-Mobile’s acquisition of Sprint</a>, a process that has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/20/fcc-chair-backs-merger-after-t-mobile-and-sprint-pledge-97-u-s-5g-coverage-in-3-years/">dragged out</a> over the past year, and in the wake of rumors — since denied — that Legere was considering taking the reins at troubled coworking company WeWork. Legere has become known at T-Mobile for his brash, aggressive style, including his willingness to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/20/t-mobile-blasts-att-and-verizon-for-outright-lies-about-5g/">directly call out rivals</a> for behaviors that weren’t in customers’ best interests, as well as his ability to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/01/20/its-total-bullshit-says-t-mobile-ceo-to-claims-that-uncarrier-model-is-unsustainable/">generate both attention and new sign-ups</a> using noteworthy public announcements.</p>
      <p>While less well-known than Legere, Sievert has served as chief marketing officer and later chief operating officer at T-Mobile over the past seven years. Today’s announcement credits him with leading “the design and execution of the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/11/05/the-uncarrier-keeps-growing-t-mobile-adds-over-1m-customers-sells-5-6m-smartphones/">16 Un-carrier moves</a> that have defined the company and established T-Mobile as the customer satisfaction leader and most-loved brand in the industry,” as well as participating in the two-year merger planning and approval process with Sprint.</p>
      <p>“I hired Mike in 2012 and I have great confidence in him,” Legere said. “I have mentored him as he took on increasingly broad responsibilities, and he is absolutely the right choice as T-Mobile’s next CEO. Mike is well prepared to lead T-Mobile into the future. He has a deep understanding of where T-Mobile has been and where it needs to go to remain the most innovative company in the industry.”</p>
      <p>Given Legere’s outsized presence and ongoing role as the face of the Un-carrier initiative, which saw the company <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/10/09/t-mobiles-next-uncarrier-moves-free-international-data-and-texts-lte-network-live-nationwide-partnership-with-shakira-omg/">make substantial commitments</a> to improving customer service, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/03/26/live-at-t-mobiles-uncarrier-event-in-nyc/">freedom from contracts</a>, and device roaming performance, the two key questions are how Sievert will continue the Un-carrier legacy and handle the still unfinished Sprint merger. Sievert says the company’s Un-carrier culture “will not change.”</p>
      <p>“Going forward,” said Sievert, “my mission is to build on T-Mobile’s industry-leading reputation for empowering employees to deliver an outstanding customer experience and to position T-Mobile not only as the leading mobile carrier, but as one of the most admired companies in America.”</p>
      <p>In a conference call explaining the transition, T-Mobile portrayed itself as having led the industry with moves that other carriers have followed, including the bundling of “<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/tmobile-uncarrier-netflix">Netflix On Us</a>” over-the-top video streaming services with cellular service. And he said the company will continue to be innovative under Sievert. In response to a question about his future, Legere jokingly noted that while the company’s investor calls will become boring after he leaves, he will remain involved as a T-Mobile board member and continue to be active on social media.</p>
