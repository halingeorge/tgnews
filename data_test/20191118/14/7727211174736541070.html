      <h1>World-class Merseyside water sports venue under threat from seaweed</h1>
      <h2>"Possibly the finest outdoor location" in one Merseyside borough may become a thing of the past</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:33:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/george-morgan/" target="_blank">George Morgan</a></address>
      <p>A prestigious Merseyside water sports location is at risk of becoming unusable.</p>
      <p>A worrying <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral-council">council</a> report revealed boat propellers are getting entangled in seaweed and surfboards are being grounded at Marine Lake in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/west-kirby">West Kirby</a> .</p>
      <p>The lake is described as “possibly the finest outdoor location” in the borough and hosts the Wilson Trophy, one of the most important team sailing events in the world.</p>
      <p>One major problem with the lake is the build up of silt on the seabed, which is decreasing the water’s depth, making it too shallow for large sailing boats.</p>

      <p>These issues have been growing for a number of years, as the report states: “Since the last dredging operation in 2009 there has been a build-up of windblown sand and tide-borne silt within the lake which is significantly reducing the available depth of water in many locations.”</p>
      <p>A new, fast-growing breed of seaweed is the other main concern. This is a much more recent problem, but dealing with it will be far from easy.</p>
      <p>The report continues: “In 2018 reports were received of an invasive species of seaweed within the lake, thought to be sargassum muticum.</p>
      <p>“The seaweed has since been observed to grow rapidly during May-June and has formed large rafts of floating weed which fouls propellers and rudders of sailing craft and impedes users of the lake.”</p>
      <p>One final issue is the degrading of the outer lake wall, thought to be caused by the growth of marine life.</p>
      <p>This is particularly inconvenient for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral</a> Council, as it has commissioned a new sailing centre at Marine Lake, due for completion in March.</p>
      <p>It is also upsetting for West Kirby Sailing Club, which has a large membership and presence in the local community.</p>
      <p>Wirral Council has three options for how to deal with the problems.</p>

      <p>One option is to do nothing, which seems unlikely given the cultural importance of the Marine Lake.</p>
      <p>The most immediate solution is to dredge the lake to rid it of silt, which will deal with the depth issues.</p>
      <p>However, this is a quick fix which would not deal with the underlying cause of the problem.</p>

      <p>Yes No</p>
      <p>A similar approach to the seaweed build-up would be to drain Marine Lake and capture the offending weed.</p>
      <p>But this has legal complications, as it may lead to a further spread of invasive seaweed elsewhere, a potential offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.</p>
      <p>Such an approach is also “likely to cause significant damage to the lake wall and walkway due to its current degraded condition”, according to the council report.</p>
      <p>A longer-term solution is also being considered. It would involve an in-depth investigation of how to protect the lake for years to come in consultation with experts and resident groups.</p>
      <p>The current state of play is that, subject to council approval, a group of specialists will be commissioned to assess the merits of the different options available.</p>
      <p>A start date for the work has not yet been set, but the council report states it would seek to avoid the peak sailing season in mid-summer.</p>
