        <b>Samsung’s new camera app appears to have let slip the potential capabilities of upcoming entries in the Galaxy range, and now we’re even more excited for the S11.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The camera app in the fourth beta of Samsung’s OneUI 2.0 software has revealed support for 8K video recording, in a big leap for video capture that could land with the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-price-release-date-specs-rumors-3707819">Samsung Galaxy S11</a>.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>This specification had already been hinted at by the fact that it’s supported by the Exynos 990, and it also indicates that the next Samsung phone will have a higher resolution sensor − possibly even the 108-megapixel sensor that was boasted by the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-oled88z9">Xiaomi Mi Note 10</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, this report from <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-app-8k-video-209-aspect-ratio-108mp/">XDA Developers</a> is far from the first that we’ve come across regarding Samsung’s next flagship phone, even though the release date is expected to fall around March 2020.</p>
      <p>In addition to this camera feature, the snapper could also boast a zoom lens of 5x or even 10x, matching or doubling the class-leading 5x zoom telephoto lens of the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p30-pro">Huawei P30 Pro</a>. Aside from the camera, we have reason to believe that the new flagship will boast a 90Hz display refresh rate, while battery in the range could vary from 4000mAh to 5000mAh.</p>
      <p>In these respects, the S11 could be a considerable improvement on the already-impressive <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/galaxy-s10-2">Samsung Galaxy S10</a>. We were impressed by the versatility of the camera and the delightfully immersive screen, but there were a couple of things we would like to see tweaked better.</p>
      <p>First of all, the battery didn’t last as long as some flagships, so it’s a relief that the rumours have indicated that this problem will be addressed.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Secondly, we’d like to see the bloatware cut down on Samsung’s custom interface — so fingers crossed that the camera app update is only one of many changes coming to OneUI 2.0.</p>
