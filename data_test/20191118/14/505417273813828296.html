        <b>Saracens have confirmed that they will not seek a review of the decision of an independent disciplinary panel which resulted in the club being deducted 35 league points and fined £5,360,272.31.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The panel found that Saracens had breached Premiership salary cap regulations in the seasons  2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. Specifically, the panel found that the club failed to disclose payment to players and exceeded the ceiling for payments to senior players in each of the three seasons.</p>
      <p>This outcome was the result of a nine-month investigation.</p>

      <p>Darren Childs, Chief Executive of Premiership Rugby, said: “We welcome Saracens’ decision to accept the verdict of the independent panel and are pleased the club has crucially reaffirmed its commitment to the Premiership Rugby Salary Cap.</p>
      <p>“This is the right outcome for English club rugby. Bringing this process to a conclusion means that we can focus on working in partnership with all Clubs to continue to build a competitive and successful league.”</p>
