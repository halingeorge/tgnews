      <p>Ballina Town F.C. has confirmed that first team manager Mick Duffy and his back room team of Declan O’Connor and Tom Duffy have stepped down from their roles with the club.</p>
      <p>A statement issued by the club today said: “Having taken over the side who were without silverware for five years the management team have since overseen an unprecedented amount of success.</p>
      <p>"They won five trophies during their tenure, the last being yesterday’s Mayo Super Cup win which made it three in a row for the club, adding to the Super League win last year and the Westaro divisional cup win earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“We wish them well in the future and thank them for all their hard work they have put in over the years which has catapulted Ballina to the top of Mayo football during their time in charge.”</p>
