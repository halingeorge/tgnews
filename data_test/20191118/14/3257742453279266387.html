      <p>Speaking at the Dreamforce 2019 event, business sales platform developer <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Salesforce">Salesforce</a> has announced new and revised services developed in conjunction with <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Apple">Apple</a>. Chief among them is Trailhead Go, a brand new education app that is solely available on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPadOS">iPadOS</a>.<br/><br/>Alongside that, there is also a revamped edition of its mobile Salesforce customer relationship management app and the company has updated its software development kit to enable other developers to produce add-ons to the service.<br/><br/>"Working together, Apple and Salesforce have helped hundreds of businesses and millions of developers transform the way they work," announced Susan Prescott, Apple's Vice President of Product Marketing for Apps, Markets and Services. <br/><br/>"With brand new Salesforce Mobile apps exclusive to iOS and iPadOS, and an enhanced SDK that supports the latest advancements in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Swift">Swift</a>, Apple together with Salesforce offers customers strong privacy, powerful multitasking and the best user experience in business on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPhone">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPad">iPad</a>," she continued.<br/><br/>Trailhead is Salesforce's free education service, providing business and technical skills training. The <a href="https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/en-gb/details/1478801670?country=us&amp;mediaType=ios_apps&amp;term=trailhead+go&amp;type=software">new Trailhead Go app</a> is the first mobile version of the system. It was developed using Apple's Swift programming language and is exclusive to iOS and iPadOS. <br/><br/>"Building natively on iOS and iPadOS also made it seamless to integrate <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Accessibility">Accessibility</a> features —like VoiceOver and the ability to magnify text —that further reduce barriers to learning," says Reid Carlberg, vice president of Trailhead Mobile. <br/><br/>"Other iOS and iPadOS features that enhance the Trailhead experience," he continued, "include Handoff and iPadOS picture-in-picture view for multi-tasking with video courses and live broadcasts from Trailhead Live."</p>
