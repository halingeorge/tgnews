      <h1>Housing bosses say safety checks were carried out in South Tyneside after Grenfell Tower tragedy</h1>
      <h2>Work to improve fire safety measures at South Tyneside's four high rise tower blocks is almost complete</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:51:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">James Harrison</a></address>
      <p>Housing bosses say they carried out extensive safety checks in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-tyneside">South Tyneside</a> in the wake of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/grenfell-tower-fire">Grenfell Tower fire</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-tyneside-council">South Tyneside Council</a> was quick to act in the aftermath of the blaze, which killed 72 people, ordering a raft of tests on the borough's four high rise blocks.</p>
      <p>And part of this involved making sure the towers had actually been constructed to the standards and specifications set out at the time.</p>
      <p>"The buildings were always safe, but we still took on type four fire risk assessments," said Gary Kirsop, director of operations at South Tyneside Homes.</p>
      <p>"We had to put holes in the walls, we smashed everything we could find just to see if, when they were constructed in 1960s and 1970s, they had been constructed as the plans said they had been."</p>
      <p>He added: "Some people were overreacting, so we sat down and gave them the answers they needed to feel their buildings were safe and also reviewed the late evacuation policy, the 'stay put' procedure, and found that is the right procedure for that building."</p>
      <p>Mr Kirsop was speaking at the last meeting of the East Shields and Whitburn Community Area Forum (CAF) and revealed safety upgrades to three of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-tyneside">South Tyneside's tower blocks</a> , Hebburn's Durham Court and Ellen Court and Wilkinson Court, in Jarrow, were complete.</p>
      <p>The last, Jarrow's Monastery Court, is '99% complete', with just a few final checks left to be carried out.</p>
      <p>Work included fitting sprinklers throughout the blocks, although housing bosses have previously revealed some tenants refused to have the system installed in their flats.</p>
      <p>"We had to do a lot of myth-busting," said Mr Kirsop.</p>
      <p>"Everyone's seen Die Hard and thought if one sprinkler went off they would all go off.</p>
      <p>"It's not like that, it's got to get hot enough to set the bulb off and and the heat has to move around to set more off."</p>
      <p>Housing bosses also said they currently have no plans to change 'stay put' fire safety procedures in place in the towers.</p>
      <p>Trevor Sturrock, station manager for Hebburn and South Shields fire stations, said: "The stay put policy has been in place in the North East and it's worked for many, many years and in many fires within high rise buildings it has worked.</p>
      <p>"The [Grenfell] inquiry is ongoing and there will be findings off the back of that, but for now it is still in place."</p>
