      <p>A labourer, who was painting the bus priority lane on the busy Outer Ring Road (ORR) near HSR Layout, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in the wee hours of Monday.</p>
      <p>The deceased, Ram Mohan Rathod, 26, hailing from Maharashtra, was working with a private firm that was given the contract for painting road signs for the bus priority lane on ORR.</p>
      <p>According to the police, as he was painting the bus lane, a speeding car mowed him down and fled from the scene. Rathod, who was hit by the car from behind while he was at work, was thrown up in the air, and he fell hitting his head on the ground, killing him on the spot. All efforts to revive him failed.</p>
      <p>As is the practice, workers painting the bus priority lane had earmarked the space with a series of fibre bollards with radium stickers that ensured visibility for approaching vehicles. However, the car driver ran over three such bollards before knocking Rathod down, a senior police officials said.</p>
      <p>The police added that the car was overspeeding and had left the scene before the others working with Rathod could realise what had happened and they haven’t been able to give any leads on the car.</p>
      <p>HSR Layout traffic police, who have registered a case, are analysing the footage from several CCTV cameras along the ORR, but have not got any leads yet. “The ORR is a very busy road and there was significant traffic plying on the road when the accident occurred. We are still analysing the footage to identify the particular car,” a senior official said.</p>
