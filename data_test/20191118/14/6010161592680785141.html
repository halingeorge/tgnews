      <h1>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order had a decent turn out on Steam</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:47:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Despite being available on other platforms, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order’s Steam numbers at launch were pretty good.</p>
      <p><b>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order</b> is the first EA game to release on Steam alongside the company’s own Origin client in nearly a decade. Future EA titles, as well as a few existing ones, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/29/ea-is-coming-back-to-steam-starting-with-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/">will all end up on Steam</a> in due course.</p>
      <p>Shortly after launch, Fallen Order peaked with 46,550 concurrent players, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/stats/">Steam’s own stats</a>.</p>
      <p>Although that is a far cry from the likes of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/02/destiny-2-big-first-day-steam-concurrent-players/">Destiny 2</a>, and other hits like <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/08/13/monster-hunter-world-breaks-own-concurrent-steam-record-sales-estimate/">Monster Hunter World</a>, it’s still a solid figure considering the game is not exclusive to Steam, and is, in fact, part of Origin Access Premier’s line-up.</p>

      <p>In other words, subscribing to the service for one month ($15) is the cheapest way to play it, which likely swayed many players’ decisions. As we’ve seen with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/09/13/gears-5-low-concurrent-steam-numbers-paint-interesting-picture/">Gears 5</a>, offering the game on a subscription service tends to drive players away from making a purchase, even if the comparison is a little unfair to Gears 5 because of Microsoft’s $1 Xbox Game Pass promo.</p>
