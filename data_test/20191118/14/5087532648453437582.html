      <h3>White House Confirms President Trump Visit Rumor</h3>
      <p>It was <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/trump-tim-cook-apple-texas/">rumored earlier in the week</a> that such a visit might take place. However, it is now confirmed. It is expected Apple CEO Time Cook will join the President for the tour of the facility. The two men have met repeatedly, with the President even commenting that Mr. Cook phones him directly.</p>
      <p>Apple <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/mac-pro-back-to-texas/">announced</a> in September it was going to produce the high-end Mac Pro at the Texas facility. Regulators granted it a number of trade tariff exemptions shortly before.</p>
