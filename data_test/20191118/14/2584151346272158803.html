      <h1>Majority of Americans support ousting Trump from office, new poll shows</h1>
      <h2>Findings come as impeachment inquiry ramps up.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:49:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Quint Forgey</a></address>
      <p>Seventy percent of Americans believe President Donald Trump was wrong to pressure Ukraine’s leader to pursue probes into his political opponents, according to a new survey, and more than half of respondents now believe he should be removed from office.</p>
      <p>An ABC News/Ipsos poll published Monday found that 51 percent of those surveyed think Trump should be impeached by House lawmakers, as well as convicted in a Senate trial. Six percent say that while Trump’s actions were wrong and that he should be impeached, he should not be ousted by the Senate.</p>
      <p>Another 13 percent also deem the president’s push for foreign investigations of his rivals to be wrong, but think he should neither be impeached nor convicted by Congress. A quarter of respondents, 25 percent, say Trump did nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>The survey’s findings come after the House impeachment inquiry’s first week of public hearings, which a majority of Americans have been monitoring. Among those polled, 21 percent have followed the proceedings “very closely” and 37 percent have followed along “somewhat closely.”</p>
      <p>A total of 42 percent of respondents say they followed last week’s testimony either “not so closely” or “not closely at all.”</p>
      <p>Still, only 21 percent of Americans say they made up their minds about impeachment after the hearings, and nearly one-third of respondents — 32 percent — reached a decision before news of the Ukraine scandal broke in September.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday, State Department officials George Kent and William Taylor testified before House impeachment investigators, and Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, appeared on Capitol Hill last Friday.</p>
      <p>Beginning Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee will hear testimony in open hearings from eight more impeachment witnesses, as the public phase of the Democrat-led inquiry into the president’s conduct enters its second week.</p>
      <p>The Ipsos poll was conducted November 16-17, surveying a random national sample of 506 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.</p>
