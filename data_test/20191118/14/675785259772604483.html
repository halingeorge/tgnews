      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:05:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A two-week-old <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/babies">baby</a> died in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prisons">jail</a> after staff allegedly refused to provide care - because she was "not an inmate".</p>
      <p>The newborn was reportedly left unconscious for up to 30 minutes at Dame Phyllis Frost Centre’s dedicated mother's and children Units in Victoria, Australia.</p>
      <p>An inmate rushed to attempt CPR and, though a nurse arrived, it was too late.</p>
      <p>Now lags at the notorious prison claim staff didn't provide care because the baby was "not an inmate".</p>
      <p>The young mum, said to be a Vietnamese woman, screamed hysterically for help but the baby was allegedly left to suffer after becoming motionless.</p>
      <p>Police will now provide a report for the coroner.</p>

      <p>The unit, which allows children to live with their mums until they are six, is part of a maximum-security jail, which is home to various high profile prisoners.</p>
      <p>Robyn Lindholm, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/femme-fatale-dubbed-black-widow-20314687">the ex-stripper dubbed "Black Widow" after murdering her ex</a> , is caged there.</p>
      <p>But Corrections Victoria, which runs the jail, says the accommodation for mums and kids "meets acceptable community standards for the safe and secure housing of children and adequately meets the nutritional, developmental and health needs of the child", adding that a nurse visits regularly to keep up to date with children’s health.</p>

      <p>However, a source told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7683161/Newborn-baby-died-inside-maximum-security-womens-jail-refused-help-guards.html">Daily Mail Australia</a> of their grave concerns for the safety of the youngsters at the jail.</p>
      <p>"What really frightens me is that there is going to be more infants coming in," the insider said.</p>
      <p>"If nothing changes, if basic first aid isn’t administered or someone is calling up at 2am and their baby has got an ear ache that could burst or something, can’t see the prison doctor for days on end, it’s only a matter of time before another baby dies."</p>
