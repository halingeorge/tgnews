      <h1>Leinster waiting on Tadhg Furlong, Joe Tomane and Rory O'Loughlin for Champions Cup clash with Lyon</h1>
      <h2>All three will be further assessed today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:59:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Leinster are waiting on Tadhg Furlong, Joe Tomane and Rory O'Loughlin ahead of Saturday's big Champions Cup pool showdown in Lyon.</p>
      <p>Furlong (back) and Tomane (hamstring) didn't feature in last Saturday's opening Pool 1 bonus point win over Benetton at the RDS.</p>
      <p>Tomane was a late withdrawal at centre and O'Loughlin, who was his replacement, picked up a shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>All three will be further assessed today as to whether they can have involvement in the clash with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/guinness-pro14">the PRO14 table-toppers.Â </a></p>
      <p>Robbie Henshaw came through his return off the bench without a hitch and is in line to start this weekend.</p>
      <p>But Caelan Doris is expected to miss out after coming off with a head injury against the Italians.</p>
      <p>There is encouraging news about hooker Sean Cronin, who returned from Ireland's World Cup squad in Japan with a neck injury.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old will again increase his training load this week and is coming closer to a return.</p>
