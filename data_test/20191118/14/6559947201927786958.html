      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Affordable. Powerful bass depth and crisp, sculpted highs. Strong battery life. Sweat-resistant design.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Audio isn't for those seeking an accurate sound signature. Cumbersome on-ear controls.</p>
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>The Creative Outlier Air earphones offer solid true wireless audio and good battery life for less than $100.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/91914/airpod-alternatives-the-best-true-wireless-earbuds">True wireless earphones</a> are everywhere these days, but they still carry a higher price than the traditional Bluetooth (not to mention wired) alternatives. For far less money than most pairs, Creative's $79.99 Outlier Air earphones deliver robust, bass-forward, sculpted audio in a completely wire-free package. The design could be a little better, but with long battery life and solid audio, these are good earphones for the price, if not quite as strong as the $80 <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/122138/anker-soundcore-liberty-air">Anker Soundcore Liberty Air</a>, our Editors' Choice.</p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>The Outlier Air earphones are available in black or champagne gold models, with an eggshell-like finish. The earpieces are fairly bulky, but lightweight. The in-ear fit is secure and comfortable enough, though there's only one extra pair of silicone eartips included, and the earpieces lack any stems or fins to aid in stabilization. Internally, graphene 5.6mm diaphragm drivers deliver the audio.</p>
      <p>The on-ear controls are divided between the two ears in a way that mostly makes sense, but might take a bit of time to memorize. The outer panels have buttons that must be pressed to be activated—they can be stiff and sometimes it feels like you're pressing the earpieces into your ear in order to play or pause. A single press on either earpiece plays or pauses the audio, a double press on the left ear skips backward a track, and the right ear skips forward a track. Holding the button on the left ear lowers the volume, and raises it on the right ear. A double tap when no music is playing will summon your phone's voice assistant. In all, this is one of the less graceful button layouts we've tested, mainly because the buttons are stiff, and operation isn't terribly smooth as a result.</p>

      <p>The charging case has a slide-out tray for the earphones to dock into. The side panel houses a USB-C port, and a charging cable is included. This outer panel also houses status LEDs that let you know when each earpiece is fully charged, and how much battery life the case has remaining.</p>
      <p>The earpieces are sweatproof, but keep in mind that the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/panasonic-toughbook-33-2-in-1-detachable-laptop/91730/feature/waterproof-dust-resistant-making-sense-of-gadget-ratings">IPX5 rating</a> means they can withstand light splashing from any direction, not serious water pressure. Thus, you can get them very sweaty, but they may not do well being rinsed off under a faucet. If you want a pair that can withstand more water pressure, it's best to look into options with IPX7 ratings, which means they can be submerged and withstand the pressure from a faucet. Regardless, all of these ratings for true wireless in-ears we've tested thus far refer to the earpieces themselves and not the charging case. If you put sweaty or wet earpieces in the charging case, there's a good chance you might break it.</p>
      <p>Creative estimates the Outlier Air's battery life to be 10 hours, with an extra 20 hours of juice in the charging case. These numbers are excellent for true wireless in-ears, but your results can will vary depending on your volume levels.</p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife's "Silent Shout," the earphones pack a powerful low-frequency punch. At top, unwise listening levels, there's no distortion, and at moderate levels the sub-bass still feels quite strong.</p>

      <p>Bill Callahan's "Drover," a track with far less deep bass in the mix, gives us a better sense of the Outlier Air's general sound signature. The drums on this track pack some serious thunder here, which tells us there's significant bass boosting happening. Callahan's baritone vocals, too, sound perhaps even more rich in the low-mids than usual. Luckily, there's enough high-mid presence to keep things clear and balanced—the acoustic strums and higher-register percussive hits have a crisp, bright presence to them. In other words, this is a highly sculpted, boosted sound signature, but it is balanced on both ends.</p>
      <p>On Jay-Z and Kanye West's "No Church in the Wild," the kick drum loop receives enough high-mid presence for its attack to retain its punchy presence, though it sounds like the real boosting is happening in higher frequencies—the vinyl hiss and crackle that's usually relegated to the background steps forward in the mix here. The drum loop's sustain, however, gets some added body and boosting in the lows, and the sub-bass synth hits that punctuate the beat are delivered with gusto. The vocals on this track are delivered cleanly and clearly, with no real added sibilance, but some added brightness in higher frequencies.</p>
      <p>Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams' <i>The Gospel According to the Other Mary</i>, sound perhaps a bit too bass-heavy. The lower-register instrumentation is pushed forward in the mix notably. The higher-register brass, strings, and vocals still retain their bright, prominent place in the mix, but the lows here are pushed beyond their supporting role and to the forefront in a way that sounds a little unnatural.</p>
      <p>The mic offers solid intelligibility. Using the Voice Memos app on an iPhone 8, we could understand every word we recorded. There was still some Bluetooth distortion around the edges of the words, but they were mostly clear, and this was true even in a somewhat noisy environment.</p>
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>For bass-forward in-ears, the Creative Outlier Air balance the powerful lows well with crisp highs. If you're looking for simple true wireless earphones under $100 that deliver deep bass, these are a solid option. Below $100, you can also consider the aformentioned Anker Soundcore Liberty Air, our Editors' Choice, as well as the $99.99 <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/122143/jbl-tune-120tws">JBL Tune 120TWS</a>. For the gym, we also like JBL's <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/jbl-endurance-peak">Endurance Peak</a> earphones, but they cost more at $120.</p>
