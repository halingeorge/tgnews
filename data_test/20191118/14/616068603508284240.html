      <p>An impaired driving bust turned violent over the weekend for a Campbell River police officer.</p>
      <p>The lone officer made a traffic stop about 3 a.m. Sunday after reports of an intoxicated driver, <a href="https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/mountie-attacked-in-sustained-battle-in-campbell-river-rcmp-1.4691010">CTV News reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old driver then attacked the Mountie, resulting in "a sustained battle to restrain the man," according to police.</p>
      <p>Two members of the public assisted the officer until backup arrived and the man was taken into custody.</p>
      <p>Jay Douglas of Alberta faces charges of assaulting a police officer causing bodily harm, and resisting arrest.</p>
