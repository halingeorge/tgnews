      <p>What are the options when looking for a new premium daily commuter bike?</p>
      <p>I’m planning to buy a new bike under Rs 1.40 lakh. I already own a Royal Enfield Electra and I’m looking for a bike that is comfortable and decently efficient. I ride a total of 70km daily, to and from work.</p>

      <p><b>AAA -</b> At your budget, you’re looking at something from the 200cc category and we can recommend either the TVS Apache RTR 200, or the Bajaj NS 200, if the TVS’ riding position is a little too sporty for your liking. If you can extend your budget a bit, you will be able to get the Yamaha FZ25, which is a comfortable and reliable motorcycle that handles the daily commute well.</p>
