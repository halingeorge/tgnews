        <b>Passengers were forced to disembark from a plane and wait alongside it while it was searched after a traveller boarded the wrong jet by mistake.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The man had been due to travel from Liverpool to Belfast with EasyJet at 07:40 GMT but instead boarded the 07:40 flight to Jersey.</p>
      <p>The security error, which one passenger called "pathetic", meant the Jersey flight was delayed by about 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>EasyJet said it was investigating how the mistake had happened.</p>
      <p>After being taken off the Jersey flight, the passenger was allowed to board the plane to Belfast, which left Liverpool John Lennon Airport at 07:50.</p>
      <p>A fellow traveller, who identified himself as TheFatTrader on Twitter, said everyone on the Jersey flight had to get off while staff checked that the man had not left anything behind.</p>
      <p>He tweeted that they had been told there was "a security breach".</p>
      <p>"A passenger boarded the wrong plane. Pathetic security," he added.</p>

      <p>An EasyJet spokesman said the firm "works closely with all of our airports to ensure the safety and security of all passengers".</p>
      <p>"As soon as the mistake was realised onboard before departure, it was arranged for the passenger to board their correct flight.</p>
      <p>"We are currently investigating how the passenger was able to board the wrong flight."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the airport said it was "working with the airline and handling agent to further investigate the circumstances".</p>
