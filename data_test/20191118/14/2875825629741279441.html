      <h1>Why did Charlotte Crosby and Joshua Ritchie split? All the theories in one place</h1>
      <h2>Fans were shocked to learn that Charlotte and Josh had decided to go their separate ways after a turbulent relationship with fiery shouting matches and homesickness</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:17:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/geordie-shore">Geordie Shore</a> legend <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/charlotte-crosby">Charlotte Crosby</a> and Love Island hunk Josh Ritchie seemed like they were in it for the long haul - especially after she upped and moved to Bolton to live with her man.</p>
      <p>It came as a jolt to fans yesterday when Charlotte announced they'd called it quits in an emotional <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> message.</p>
      <p>Charlotte, 29, shared the post, which seemed level-headed and calm.</p>
      <p>25 year old Josh, meanwhile, seemed to be doing alright as he partied the night away in Manchester.</p>
      <p>He's yet to comment on social media on how his relationship, in Charlotte's words, had "broken down."</p>
      <p>Here are the theories behind why the pair split...</p>

      <h3>Charlotte struggled with the move away from home...</h3>
      <p>She made no secret of the fact that she was struggling with the idea of leaving behind her beloved Toon.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on Celebs Go Dating, Charlotte shed some tears when discussing the big move.</p>
      <p>She cried to agent Anna Williamson: "It's a big deal and sometimes I don't think he recognises how much a big deal it is."</p>
      <p>Charlotte added: "I'm moving away from everyone I love."</p>

      <p>What's more, she claimed that Josh wouldn't let her dogs move in with them...</p>
      <h3>The arguments got heated again...</h3>
      <p>Charlotte was extremely candid about her blazing rows during the filming of her reality bash, The Charlotte Show.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/7588145/charlotte-crosby-and-joshua-richies-furious-rows-force-them-into-couples-counselling-in-bid-to-save-relationship/">The Sun Online</a> that they'd get into more rows as their relationship became more and more serious.</p>

      <p>"Now we are more serious we have some really big rows. We really know how to wind each other up and how to annoy each other.</p>
      <p>"He seems so laid back but when he finally snaps he has a massive temper.</p>
      <p>"We hit a bit of a hard place in our relationship. We weren't moving forward, we were just moving backwards."</p>
      <p>She added: "We were filming The Charlotte Show and arguing solidly for three hours and in the end the camera crew put down the cameras and sat us down and started counselling us."</p>
      <h3>"He's clearly in it for her money and fame..."</h3>
      <p>So penned a disgruntled fan during their Celebs Go Dating couples' therapy.</p>
      <p>Speaking to dating expert Paul C Brunson - without Charlotte - Josh had fans thinking that he was with Charlotte for her wallet and limelight.</p>

      <p>"There's something different about Charlotte," he said vaguely when Paul asked what he sees in her.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "As if Josh would ever dump Charlotte. She's a multi-millionaire and she's his meal ticket. That expensive watch and designer clothes won't buy themselves. #CelebsGoDating."</p>
      <h3>Charlotte felt "abandoned" by Josh...</h3>
      <p>After some arguments, Charlotte revealed that Josh would sometimes back his bags.</p>
      <p>"He just packs his things and goes home," she said before they'd shacked up together, "I just cry and cry. I don't know why but it just gets to me, it makes me feel abandoned."</p>
      <p>Anna Williamson told Charlotte bluntly that Josh wouldn't be able to go anywhere if they ever got married and "s**t hits the fan."</p>
