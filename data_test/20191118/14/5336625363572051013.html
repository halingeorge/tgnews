      <h1>T-Mobile CEO John Legere to step down</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:55:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/aperry/" target="_blank">Alex Perry</a></address>
      <p>After more than seven years on the job, T-Mobile CEO John Legere is stepping down.</p>
      <p>The enigmatic executive will give way to current company president and COO Mike Sievert when Legere's contract expires at the end of April, <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/mike-sievert-to-succeed-john-legere">T-Mobile announced</a> Monday morning. Legere will remain a member of the company's board, with whom he worked with for some time to put together a succession plan.</p>
      <p>Legere is most identifiable as the face of T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/our-story/un-carrier-history">"Un-carrier" initiative</a>, a years-long marketing campaign designed to make the carrier look a little more consumer-friendly than its competitors. Since its debut in 2013, the program has been used to justify the elimination of surprise fees in bills, complimentary subscriptions to Netflix, and so on.</p>
      <p>He also oversaw T-Mobile's blockbuster acquisition of Sprint, which is still <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fcc-approves-tmobile-sprint-merger/">fighting for regulatory approval</a> from the U.S. government.Â </p>
      <p>What's next for Legere remains to be determined. Rumors of his imminent departure started spreading last week, with some claiming he would take over for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wework-ceo-adam-neumann-steps-down/">outgoing WeWork CEO</a> Adam Neumann. However, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/john-legere-isnt-leaving-t-mobile-to-take-wework-ceo-job.html">CNBC report</a> published late last week refuted that notion.</p>
      <p>One thing is for certain: You only have a little bit longer to see Legere's face in targeted ads on Twitter. Cherish it.</p>
