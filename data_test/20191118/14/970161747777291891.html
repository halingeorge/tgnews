      <p>Eamonn Holmes released his inner diva and walked out of The Lateish Show With Mo Gilligan before it had finished recording because filming was taking too long.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> host appeared on Mo’s Channel 4 show earlier this year alongside the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a>’s Caroline Flack and X Factor presenter Dermot O’Leary but ended up leaving the sofa ahead of the episode wrapping.</p>

      <p>Recalling the bizarre incident on Jay Rayner’s podcast Out To Lunch, Dermot explained: ‘I did the Mo Gilligan show a while back, to promote X Factor, and Mo’s this charming young guy, comedian on Channel 4, who’s getting this new show.</p>
      <p>‘Eamonn Holmes was with us, and the recording’s quite long, and Eamon, just, sort of, about three-quarters of the way through went, “I’ve got to be up in the morning, I’m not having this,” and he just wasn’t there when we came back.’</p>
      <p>Dermot continued: ‘Yes, he just went, but, I mean, he said, “How much longer is this going to go on for?” I said, “Well, I think it’s the third or fourth part now,” he said, “Oh, no. No, no,” and he just, and it wasn’t announced, it was just literally, like, he wasn’t on the couch.’</p>

      <p>Slightly awkward, but perhaps Eamonn had an early wake-up call for This Morning?</p>
      <p>Eamonn has presented the ITV daytime show alongside his wife Ruth Langsford on Fridays and during school holidays since 2006.</p>
      <p>From 6 January 2020, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/morning-get-even-longer-itv-revamps-morning-schedule-11083364/">the programme will be extended by 30 minutes</a> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/morning-get-even-longer-itv-revamps-morning-schedule-11083364/">and will start half-an-hour earlier,</a> meaning alarms will need to be moved forward.</p>

      <p>Presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield addressed the time changes in a recent episode, with Holly joking: ‘Two and a half hours, yikes! I’ll be able to sing and dance.’</p>
