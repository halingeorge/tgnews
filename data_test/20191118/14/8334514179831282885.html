      <p>BEIJING (Reuters) - Some people who had been in close contact with pneumonic plague patients from Inner Mongolia have been released from medical observation, China’s health authority said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Out of 46 close contacts of the two now-quarantined pneumonic plague patients, 42 were released from medical observation and four were still under monitoring, the health commission of the autonomous region said in a statement on its website.</p>
      <p>Pneumonic plague, a lung disease spread mostly by rats, has death rates of close to 100% in humans if left untreated, according to Beijing health authorities.</p>
      <p>None of the 46 people have shown signs of fever or other abnormal symptoms, according to the statement.</p>
      <p>Officials said the risk of an outbreak of pneumonic plague was minimal after the two cases were confirmed last week in Beijing.</p>
      <p>Inner Mongolia health authority reported on Sunday a case of bubonic plague, which is the most common form of plague globally and can spread to lungs and cause the more severe pneumonic plague.</p>
      <p>A total of 28 people who had close contact with the bubonic plague patient were still under observation without showing any abnormality, the Monday statement said.</p>
      <p>No new case of plague was found in the region, the statement said.</p>
