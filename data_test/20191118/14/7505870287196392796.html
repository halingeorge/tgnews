      <h1>Amazon is blowing out MacBooks and MacBook Pros starting at $700, today only</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:49:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>Amazon <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/06/black-friday-2019-amazon-deals-dates-announcement/">announced its big Black Friday plans</a> earlier this month and according to those details, the retailer’s week-long Black Friday blowout is set to start this coming Friday, November 22nd. That leaves us confused, however, because the sales running today in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/blackfriday?tag=b0c55-20">Amazon’s HoliDeals hub</a> are even better than some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve ever seen. Case in point: Amazon is blowing out renewed MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops today at some of the best prices we’ve found all year. Apple’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Dual-Core-802-11ac-Bluetooth/dp/B07K1HVFH9?tag=b0c55-20">12-inch MacBook</a> starts at just $699.99 while the 13-<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-Silver-Refurbished/dp/B07M8FL9GQ?tag=b0c55-20">inch MacBook Pro</a> starts at $799.99 on Monday. These are refurbs and many of them will sell out, so you had definitely better hurry if you want one!</p>
