      <h1>Three's Unlimited Data Plan is Now at its Lowest Ever Price</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:40:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Having unlimited data plans available isn't a big deal anymore, since all the big networks have started offering limit-free data allowances since the launch of 5G earlier this year. So what does this mean for Three, which has been offering unlimited data for ages? Lower prices, of course.</p>
      <p>O2, Vodafone, and EE are still charging a premium for unlimited data, presumably because they can and people are paying for it anyway. Three, however, can't seem to stop slashing the prices, and the latest deal means you can get a 12 month unlimited data deal<a href="http://store.three.co.uk/view/basket/SIMOnlyD13112019T144262?manufacturer=Three&amp;id=1666&amp;ty=aff&amp;aff_id=3713&amp;link_id=fc&amp;link_ref=trd-1316820612258221565"> for just Â£18 a month.</a></p>
      <p>That deal offers unlimited calls, texts, and tethering alongside that hefty data allowance, plus all the usual Three perks like Go Roam, Go Binge, and the promise of a 5G upgrade when Three launches it in your area.</p>
      <p>Naturally this is only a 12 month deal, and there's no stopping Three from upping your monthly bill this time next year. That said, the way things have been going, you might well be able to get the same deal for even less. But we'll just have to wait and see what happens there. For now, you can <a href="http://store.three.co.uk/view/basket/SIMOnlyD13112019T144262?manufacturer=Three&amp;id=1666&amp;ty=aff&amp;aff_id=3713&amp;link_id=fc&amp;link_ref=trd-1316820612258221565">make do with what's on offer.</a></p>
