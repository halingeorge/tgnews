        <b>The GAA have confirmed that the International Rules Series will return in 2020, with a two-test series against Australia in Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>An Irish side will host an Australian Football League selection in a two-test series in November of next year before a further series down under in 2022.</p>
      <p>Next year's tests are slated for the 15th and 21st of November, with the location yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>It will have been three years since the sides last met, with Australia reclaiming the Cormac McAnallen Trophy back in 2017, beating Ireland in Adelaide and Perth.</p>
      <p>GAA Director General Tom Ryan said: "We are pleased to announce the return of the International Rules Series in 2020 and look forward to re-connecting with our friends and colleagues in the AFL, both on and off the field.</p>
      <p>"The series offers our players the chance to wear the green jersey and represent Ireland and it also provides them with an opportunity to pit themselves against the best from another code while showcasing the best skills of Gaelic football," he added.</p>
      <p>AFL General Manager Football Operations Steve Hocking said players named in the 2020 Virgin Australia All-Australian team will be the first qualify.</p>
      <p>“We want to take the best of the best to the two-Test series in Ireland next year and our All-Australian players will be the first players selected,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The International Rules Series tests allow players from both codes the only opportunity to represent their countries and have traditionally been great contests that have showcased their athleticism.</p>
      <p>“We saw in 2017 two high standard matches that drew great attendances. I look forward to the rivalry continuing when the test series returns next year.”</p>
      <p>The AFL also confirmed the Australian team will again conduct a training camp in New York prior to the matches in Ireland in November of next year.</p>
