      <p>But after an "honest" chat with bosses about what she would face, Gloria decided the challenge wasn't for her.</p>
      <p>Speaking to former contestant Joey Essex and her fellow panellists, Gloria explained what made her change her mind.</p>
      <p>She said: "Well this year... I had to have meetings with the producers and the editor.</p>

      <p>"In one way I wanted to challenge myself, but when they were really honest with me and told me what it was like, I thought well.</p>
      <p>"I’m allergic to mosquitoes really badly, I'm a hospital case with that. I could do without the food I think... I don’t think I could do all the picking up of wood with my dodgy knee.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I could do the snake bit, and I certainly couldn’t eat a pig's brain."</p>

      <p>Joey recalled his own experiences on the show, with him leaving in 9th place in 2013.</p>
      <p>Fellow daytime star Kate Garraway is currently in the jungle, with the Good Morning Britain host facing the next trial.</p>
      <p>She was shown struggling with a terrifying plank challenge on Sunday evening, and now she and Caitlyn will face insects and rats in sealed boxes for the first Bushtucker Trial of the series.</p>
      <p>A teaser clip released by ITV shows Kate screaming as more and more creatures join her in the box which is elevated in the air.</p>
