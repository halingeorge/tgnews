      <p><b>Tori Spelling</b>’s mom, <b>Candy Spelling</b>, does not have trust issues with her daughter’s husband, <b>Dean McDermott</b>, despite an untrue report. The story is wrong. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can debunk it.</p>
      <p><i><b>OK!</b></i> is claiming Candy is “up in arms” over comments that Tori’s husband recently made about relationships. Specifically, McDermott saying, “Monogamy is hard.” From there, the publication goes on to quote a totally anonymous source as saying, Candy “has never taken to Dean but she’s done her best to tolerate him for the sake of her daughter and her grandchildren.” But, according to the unnamed source, Candy thinks Dean has gone too far, saying, “Candy feels like Dean is just setting himself up for an excuse to cheat on Tori again.”</p>
      <p>The seemingly fake tipster adds, “It’s caused a strain between Tori and Candy, but Tori isn’t going to leave Dean. She says he’s pretty much become the husband she always hoped he’d be.” The story is completely bogus.</p>
      <p>The quote comes from a much larger interview with <i>Us Weekly</i>. In it, McDermott doesn’t only say monogamy is hard, he explains why. The actor also explains why he needs to be monogamous, saying, “Monogamy is hard for, I guess, several reasons,” continuing, “Every relationship is work and when you get to that point, you can’t bail. You’ve gotta knuckle under and work it out.” Despite saying he find it “hard,” McDermott also recognizes it’s worth the work that goes into it. The tabloid cherry-picked one part of a larger quote and invented an entirely false premise around it.</p>
      <p>Just to be sure, instead of taking the word of an unnamed, possibly made-up source, <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked with a rep for Tori, who’s qualified to speak on the actress’s behalf. Her spokesperson exclusively tells us, “Tori and her mom and Dean are in the best place in their relationship ever right now. Candy was just over at their house last week celebrating Halloween with them, and they will all be celebrating Thanksgiving together. Everything is great.”</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, <i>OK!</i> can’t be trusted for anything else related to the actress. Just two weeks ago, the publication ran a bogus report alleging <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tori-spelling-bh90210-second-season-debt/">Spelling needs a second season of <i>BH90210</i> to pay off her debt</a>. Similar to the more recent article, this one also relied on an anonymous tipster, but the report was totally off-base. In August, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out the publication for a phony story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tori-spelling-bh90210-second-season-debt/">Spelling feuding with <i>BH90210</i> co-star Jennie Garth</a>. The tabloid knows very little about the actress’s personal and professional life.</p>
