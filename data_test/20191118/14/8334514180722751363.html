      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s focus in deciding who should build out its 5G network should be on security standards, not individual firms, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Asked about pressure from some fellow conservatives to bar China’s Huawei Technologies from 5G contracts, Merkel told reporters: “It is not about individual companies, but rather security standards. It is about the certification we will carry out. That should be our guiding benchmark.”</p>
