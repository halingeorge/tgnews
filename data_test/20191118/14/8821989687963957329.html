      <h1>Motley Crue to Reunite for Tour With Def Leppard, Poison: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:55:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author">Nick DeRiso</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/motley-crue/">Motley Crue</a> are reportedly getting back together five years after signing a "Cessation of Touring Agreement." They're set to announce a 2020 stadium tour with <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/def-leppard/">Def Leppard</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/poison/">Poison</a>, according to <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/motley-crue-def-leppard-poison-set-2020-stadium-tour-913823/">Rolling Stone</a></i>.</p>
      <p>The band has stoked rumors of impending dates by retweeting a fan request that it returns to the road. The <a href="https://www.change.org/p/motley-crue-bring-motley-crue-back">Change.org</a> listing says "if the rumors circulating about a Motley Crue comeback are true, then let this petition solidify it. The new fans need a new tour, PLEASE COME BACK." Motley Crue's tweet has <a href="https://twitter.com/MotleyCrue/status/1195455780176089088">since been deleted</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-black-crowes/">Black Crowes</a> manager Mark DiDia referenced the possibility of a Motley Crue reunion during an appearance on Howard Stern's radio show, even mentioning that the tour would apparently feature two other major bands. Poison singer <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/bret-michaels/">Bret Michaels</a> also <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bret-michaels-new-poison-music/">recently said</a> he was "working real hard right now to put together something incredible with some other bands for next summer."</p>
      <p>Motley Crue's final tour included almost 160 shows, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-farewell-show/">concluding on Dec. 31, 2015</a>, at the Forum in their hometown of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>"Legally, we can't play again," Motley Crue bassist <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/nikki-sixx/">Nikki Sixx</a> told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 2014. "The only loophole is if all four band members agreed to do it, we could override our own contract – but we know that will never happen. There are people in this band who will refuse to ever do it again, and you're talking to one of them. There is no amount of money that would ever make me do it again because I have such pride in how we're ending it."</p>

      <h3>12 Farewell Tours That Weren’t Actually Goodbye</h3>

      <h4>The Who (1982)</h4>
      <p>A variety of factors caused the Who to break up following their tour in support of 1982's 'It's Hard.' But seven years later, they decided to get back together to honor their 25th anniversary. Another celebration, this time for 'Quadrophenia,' followed in 1996, and they've toured fairly regularly since.</p>

      <h4>Ozzy Osbourne (1992)</h4>
      <p>Ozzy Osbourne had fully planned to retire in 1992 -- he even named the jaunt in support of 'No More Tears' "No More Tours." But shortly after the final show, which saw his former Black Sababth bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward sit in, he had a change of heart. “Retirement sucked,” he said “It wasn’t too long before I started getting antsy and writing songs again.” He came out of retirement in 1995 with 'Ozzmosis.' He recently announced another farewell tour for 2018, although he cautioned that he may continue to play the occasional concert once that trek is over.</p>

      <h4>Judas Priest (2011)</h4>
      <p>Judas Priest had intended for their 2011 Epitaph World Tour to be their last. Founding guitarist K.K. Downing even retired six weeks before the first show. But even even before the tour was over, energized by new recruit Richie Faulkner, they announced plans to stay together and release a new album. 'Redeemer of Souls' came out in 2014.</p>

      <h4>Kiss (2000)</h4>
      <p>While Kiss' late-'90s reunion with Ace Frehley and Peter Criss re-established the band as a major arena draw, within a few years the old personality conflicts came to the fore, and they billed their lengthy stretch in 2000 as the "Farewell Tour." However, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons quickly decided to instead carry on without their former bandmates.</p>

      <h4>Elton John (1977)</h4>
      <p>A handful of songs into his Nov. 3, 1977 show at Wembley Arena, Elton John stunned the crowd by saying, “I haven’t been touring for a long time and it’s been a painful decision whether to go back on the road ... but I’ve made a decision and this is the last show I’m gonna do.” By February 1979, he was back on the road, performing with only percussionist Ray Cooper on a lengthy series of dates that saw him play in the Soviet Union.</p>

      <h4>Motley Crue (2014-15)</h4>
      <p>When announcing their two-year Final Tour in 2014, Motley Crue insisted they were done with performing together that they signed, with the press as witnesses, a "Cessation of Touring Agreement." But the contract had a loophole, stating that they could tour again if all four agreed to it. Sure enough, in November 2019, as reports of a summer 2020 tour surfaced, they declared the document null and void by blowing it up.</p>

      <h4>Doobie Brothers (1982)</h4>
      <p>After the Doobie Brothers made the transition from gritty, four-piece biker band to slick jazz-pop septet, Patrick Simmons, the only original member left, quit in 1981. He was coaxed back for one last tour a year later, with a final show that brought back two other founders, singer-guitarist Tom Johnston and drummer John Hartman. Five years later, they returned to play some benefit concerts, and have been active ever since. Some of their tours have even brought five-time Grammy winner Michael McDonald back into the group.</p>

      <h4>Black Sabbath (1999)</h4>
      <p>Black Sabbath were so serious about quitting in 1999 that they named their tour "The Last Supper." But, as with Ozzy's premature retirement, it didn't take. A little more than a year after the last concert, they were recording with Rick Rubin. Although those tracks were never completed, they regrouped, albeit without drummer Bill Ward, in 2011, for '13.' In 2016, they embarked on another long goodbye, "The End Tour," which concluded Feb. 4, 2017 in their hometown of Birmingham, England.</p>

      <h4>Scorpions (2010)</h4>
      <p>The German heavy metal giants said that they would call it quits following the promotional cycle for 2010's 'Sting in the Tail.' However, while on the road, they noticed that they were now connecting with a younger generation of fans and changed their minds. 'Comeblack,' which saw them record new versions of their biggest hits and a handful of covers, followed in 2011, with a collection of new material, 'Return to Forever,' arriving in 2015.</p>

      <h4>Cream (1968)</h4>
      <p>The mercurial personalities in Cream -- Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker hated each other going back to their days in the Graham Bond Organisation -- meant that rock's defining power trio were fated to burn out quickly. On Nov. 26, 1968, a little less than two years after their debut, 'Fresh Cream,' they gave a final concert. It took 37 years for Eric Clapton to realize how much he missed playing with them, and arranged a reunion, with four shows at London's Royal Albert Hall -- the site of that last show -- in May 2005. It went well enough that they booked three more nights for that October at New York's Madison Square Garden.</p>

      <h4>The Band (1976)</h4>
      <p>One of rock's most storied concerts, 'The Last Waltz,' saw the Band put an end to 16 years on the road with friends like Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Muddy Waters helping them say goodbye. By 1983, four of its five members regrouped, with other musicians hired to replace guitarist Robbie Robertson, who refused to take part. They remained a touring entity, even weathering the suicide of pianist/singer Richard Manuel in 1986, and recorded three albums in the '90s, until bassist/singer Rick Danko died in 1999.</p>

      <h4>Nine Inch Nails (2009)</h4>
      <p>Saying that he feared ending up like "Gene Simmons, an old man who puts on makeup to entertain kids, like a clown going to work," Trent Reznor decided to get off the road with 2009's "Wave Goodbye Tour," although he never said he was retiring the Nine Inch Nails name. It proved to be what he needed as he moved towards other projects, including film scoring, over the next few years. His return to Nine Inch Nails for 2013's 'Hesitation Marks' brought with it a desire to perform again, as evidenced by the year-long "Twenty Thirteen Tour."</p>

      <h4>Meat Loaf (2013)</h4>
      <p>Citing the rigorous physical demands of performing and traveling, Meat Loaf decided to quit following his spring 2013 tour of Europe, which he dubbed the "Last at Bat." By September of that same year, he was participating in a 'Storytellers'-like series in Las Vegas and resumed touring in 2015. This return may be short-lived - a year later, while promoting 'Braver Than We Are,' he told us, "I’m almost 70 years old. I can’t keep touring."</p>

      <h4>Status Quo (1984)</h4>
      <p>In 1984, Status Quo launched the "End of the Road Tour," a 10-week stretch across Europe and the U.K., although they planned to continue writing and recording. But they were coaxed out of retirement to be the opening act at Live Aid and, in April 1986, returned to performing with the "Quo's Back Tour."</p>
