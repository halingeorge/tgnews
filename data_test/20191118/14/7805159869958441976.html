      <h1>Firebase Authentication now supports Sign in with Apple</h1>

      <p>Whenever I sign-up for a new online service or an app asks me to sign-in to store some data in the cloud, I generally try to use one of the “sign in with” options, which usually includes Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Microsoft, if they are supposed. Most people already have one or more accounts with these large providers, so it’s convenient, both for the user and for the developer, to support logins this way. For app developers, unless you really want to (or have to) implement your own user authentication system, then you’re better off using an off-the-shelf auth system like <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/">Firebase Authentication</a>.</p>
      <p>The Firebase Auth SDK makes it easy for developers to add a complete sign-in system with an <a href="https://opensource.google/projects/firebaseui">accompanying UI</a> to their apps. It currently supports basic email/password-based and phone number authentication, but it also supports the following federated identity providers: Google Sign-In, Facebook Login, Sign in with Twitter, Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Yahoo, and GitHub. Now, the service has added another provider, as Google <a href="https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/11/sign-in-with-apple-auth.html">announced</a> late last week that Firebase Authentication now supports <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/">Sign in with Apple</a>. Support for Sign in with Apple is currently in beta, but developers can add a Sign in with Apple button to their iOS, Android, or web apps using the latest versions of the Firebase SDKs. Developers no longer need to use a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/custom-auth">custom authentication system</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/configuring_your_webpage_for_sign_in_with_apple">manually embed a “Sign in with Apple” button</a> on their webpage.</p>

      <p>With yet another popular identity provider added to Firebase Auth, developers can encourage more users to sign-up for their services by providing a secure, convenient, and familiar way to sign-up.</p>
