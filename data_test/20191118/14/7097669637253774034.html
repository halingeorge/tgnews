      <h1>‘Give me the guinea pigs!’: Pet shop owner says stolen animal thrown at him after chasing thieves</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:35:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Samuel Lovett</a></address>
      <p>Two women attempted to steal <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/guinea-pigs">guinea pigs</a> from a pet store in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, before throwing one of the animals at the shop owner, he has alleged.</p>
      <p>US news outlets report that 21-year-old Isabelle Mason and 19-year-old Jaimee Pack tried to smuggle out the animals from a Pet Paradise store in Danville on Saturday without paying.</p>
      <p>The owner of the shop, Scott Gonyaw, sensed something sinister was afoot when he noticed one of the women was carrying an “over-sized purse”.</p>
      <p>“Didn’t look typically like the kind of girls that would be carrying an over-sized purse, a very new-looking over-sized purse, and so I was suspicious,” Mr Gonyaw told <a href="https://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Two-woman-arrested-after-allegedly-stealing-guinea-pigs-from-pet-store-565049592.html">WKYT-TV.</a></p>
      <p>Detective-turned-vigilante, Mr Gonyaw followed the women as they left the store and subsequently confronted them as they got into a car.</p>
      <p>“I started screaming at them, ‘Give me the guinea pigs!’” he said.</p>
      <p>One of the suspects then rolled down a window before tossing a four-month-old guinea pig onto the concrete while the other women drove over Mr Gonyaw’s foot as he gave chase. He says he suffered bruising and swelling.</p>
      <p>The guinea pig, appropriately named Lucky, escaped the incident without harm. The location of the second animal, however, remains a mystery.</p>

      <p>The mother of one of the two women later called the police, who discovered an extra guinea pig after searching their apartment.</p>
      <p>The animal was brought to Pet Paradise to be identified but did not match the missing guinea pig.</p>
      <p>Jail records show Danville police charged the women with shoplifting, robbery and animal cruelty.</p>
