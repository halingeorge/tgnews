      <h1>Amazon slashes the price of Apple earpods in surprise sale ahead of Black Friday</h1>
      <h2>Amazon has dropped a 'Countdown to Black Friday sale' that includes a price drop on Apple Airpods</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:50:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author">Kali Lindsay, Catherine Murphy</a></address>
      <p>The Black Friday sale kicks off on Friday - but one retailer is offering big savings already.</p>
      <p>In a surprising move, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/">Amazon</a> has today dropped a 'Countdown to Black Friday sale' which includes a huge price drop on Apple Airpods.</p>
      <p>The discount makes the item £30 cheaper than its currently priced in Apple stores.</p>
      <p>Cutting the price from £159 to £129, Amazon has taken £30 off the iconic buds, which might not seem like much, but is a considerable discount for an item whose price tag rarely sees much movement, reports Mirror Online.</p>
      <p>Coming complete with charging case and cable, the same earphones will still set you back £159 at the Apple Store right now or £249 for the AirPods Pro.</p>
      <p>If you're an Amazon Prime member, you'll also get free delivery on the Apple Airpods.</p>
      <p>But the Airpods aren't the only impressive gadget to get a discount today, with Amazon launching plenty of other offers as part of its countdown sale, before everything fully kicks off this Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>For example, Amazon's Echo Dot is now £34.99, rather than its usual £49.99.</p>
      <p>There is also a range of discounted homeware available too.</p>
      <p>You can shop the deals <a href="https://amzn.to/2QtkMKj">here.</a></p>
