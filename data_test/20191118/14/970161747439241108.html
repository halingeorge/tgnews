      <p>Christmas is just around the corner, which means it’s time to pick up your annual decorations (if you’re not going to reuse the ones from last year).</p>
      <p>Beyond the usual tree, wreaths and twinkling lights, why not get something festive for the kids’ bedroom this year?</p>
      <p>Terrys Fabrics has released a Christmas duvet set with a jolly design of a winter village, covered in snow and with Father Christmas flying up above.</p>
      <p>Sure, it’s pretty, but there’s a special twist that makes it absolutely magical – and one that children will love.</p>
      <p>When you turn the lights off, the bedding will light up: it glows in the dark.</p>
      <p>‘Children will adore this traditional Christmas style duvet set with deep blues, snow falling, Santa’s sleigh flying through the air and Christmas tree,’ the description on the website reads.</p>
      <p>‘This fun bedding set has matching pillowcases, the duvet will be the talk amongst friends with its glow in the dark motifs.’</p>

      <p>It’s also the perfect way to help children who are afraid of the dark to give up their night light.</p>
      <p>While the product is aimed at a younger audience, there’s nothing stopping you from buying it for that friend or family member who loves Christmas.</p>
      <p>At the affordable price of £18.99 for a double set, it could even be a gift for the secret Santa round at the office.</p>
      <p>The single is a bit cheaper, at £12.99 but both options come with two pillowcases.</p>
      <p>Shoppers love the item, with <a href="https://www.terrysfabrics.co.uk/products/glow-in-the-dark-christmas-bedding-set-multicolour?variant=29479784251486&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt7iogqzu5QIVRbDtCh2wFwNOEAkYASABEgLU3_D_BwE&amp;source=aw&amp;_%24ja=tsid~44737%7Cprd~78888">five-star reviews across the board</a> (though there are only three reviews, so take the recommendations with a pinch of salt).</p>
      <p>In other news, if you haven’t bought your Christmas tree yet and dread the mess from the pine needles, try this <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/mum-creates-genius-hack-affordable-christmas-tree-kids-cant-knock-11174252/">genius hack</a>.</p>
      <p>A mum created a super cheap tree with the help of two pieces of wood and fake fir, and then attached it to her wall.</p>
      <p>Not only will it save her from having to clean up after the holidays, but the kids won’t knock it over when playing, either.</p>
