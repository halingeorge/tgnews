      <p><b>Update (18th Nov, 14:45):</b> Already confirmed for other parts of the world, we've now had word that the stylish Switch Lite Flip Cover is coming to North America on December 8th, with a retail price of $39.99.</p>

      <p><b>Update (3rd Sep, 10:45):</b> Great news, folks! The official Switch Lite Flip Cover has been confirmed for release in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo-switch/accessories/">Australia</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch/Accessories/Accessories-1183144.html">UK</a>. In Australia, it'll launch on 6th December, while UK buyers will have to wait until January 2020.</p>

      <p><b>Original Article (30th Aug, 16:30 BST):</b> As with any portable device, you'll likely want to make sure <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/guide_where_to_pre-order_nintendo_switch_lite">your new Switch Lite</a> is as safe as can be after its launch next month. We're sure it can handle being dropped a few times, but it's always better to be safe than sorry.</p>
      <p>Luckily, Nintendo has revealed its very own official Flip Cover for the new console, and it looks like a perfect solution. As you can see in the images below, it appears to simply clasp on to the rear of your console, with one section flipping over to protect the screen, buttons and control sticks. From there, it looks like you can just flip that cover off and get back to playing, all while keeping the case attached.</p>

      <p>It's a pretty smart way to stop your console from being battered, so we're hoping this makes its way over to the west; at present, it's only available on the <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.jp/category/ACCESSORY/HDH_A_CSSAA.html">Japanese My Nintendo store</a>, where customers can pre-order it for 3,758 yen (approx. Â£29 / $35). It launches there in November, so we guess you could try to find a way of importing it if it doesn't get released over here.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Would you grab one of these if it released in your area? Here's hoping Nintendo gives it a worldwide launch.</i>
