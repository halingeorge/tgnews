        <b>It has been understood that Manchester United could end up signing Bruno Fernandes during the upcoming January transfer window, as his current employers Sporting CP are in a dire need to raise funds.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205905/Manchester-United-Bruno-Fernandes-Man-Utd-transfer-news-January-rumours-gossip"><i>Express</i></a> claims that as per <i><a href="https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/sporting/noticias/sporting-tem-dividas-e-precisa-de-65-milhoes-de-euros-ate-janeiro-11524268.html?target=conteudo_fechado">O Jogo</a></i>‘s report, Sporting CP are in trouble financially, and they desperately need to raise funds before the end of February.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese outlet further adds that they need €65million (£57million), which can be obtained easily if they sell Fernandes to Manchester United. However, as they had previously demanded an asking price of €76million (£65million) for him, it means that if they complete the sale during Janaury, it will be for a reduced price.</p>
      <p>Recently, Fernandes himself hinted that he would like to play for a European giant in the near future.</p>
      <p>“I’m not worried at all [about transfer window speculation],” the 25-year-old midfielder said Portugal’s 6-0 win against Lithuania in the UEFA Euro Qualifier last week.</p>
      <p>“Since 2016, there’s been talk about my possible departure.”</p>
      <p>“I’m well, doing my job and doing the best I can. I have dreams to fulfil but I have no need to force my departure,” he further added, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“I feel the love here and if I have to leave, I hope I leave good memories.”</p>
