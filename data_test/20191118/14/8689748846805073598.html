      <p>In a recent interview with Zionfelix on his uncut show, Xandy Kamel disclosed that  her decision to quit church is because of the high level of hypocrisy in the churches.</p>
      <p>According to Xandy, the church is plagued with a “family and friends” syndrome because no one helps you unless they have an affiliation with you.</p>
      <p>Xandy believes in praying at home rather than attend church because some pastors look down on and shy away from celebrities who are very outspoken.</p>
      <p>“the church is supposed to reform people so if you will just criticise and not straighten me then I’ll just stay in my house and pray”.</p>
