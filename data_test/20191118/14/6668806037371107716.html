      <p>Speculations have been rife regarding Shah Rukh Khan’s next outing. Reports suggest that the superstar might soon be collaborating with South filmmaker, Atlee, for a film titled, Sanki. While the film will reportedly go on the floors in March 2020, an official announcement will be made just before the shoot begins. It is also reported that it’ll be an out-an-out-action film, which will feature SRK in a never- seen-before avatar.</p>
      <p>When Atlee was asked about working with SRK, he told the daily, "I have a huge amount of love and respect for SRK sir and he also loves my work. Soon, hopefully, we will do something about it."</p>

      <p>Telugu writer-director, Harish Shankar stated that more than a writer-director, he is waiting for this to happen as he is a huge fan of SRK. He wishes to see the superstar do action.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, Shah Rukh Khan and Atlee's next is said to be an original one. SRK had previously said that he has been working on a lot of scripts and is yet to finalise them. SRK also assured that he would make the big announcement within two to three months.</p>
      <p>All eyes on March 2020!</p>
