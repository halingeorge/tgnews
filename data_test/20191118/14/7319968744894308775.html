        <b>IrishCentral readers have a true passion for history and we want you to join in the conversation on our Facebook group dedicated to Irish history.</b>
      </p>
      <p>From the ancient Stone Age sites of Newgrange to the hallowed lands of the Hill of Tara, the tragic loss of life and hardship of Ireland's Great Hunger to the pride and patriotism of Ireland's Easter Rising and War of Independence - IrishCentral readers love Irish history. </p>
      <p>Over our ten years online on thing about IrishCentral's readers has remained true and that's their love of Irish history, from genealogy and Irish names, to modern history and Irish American tales, including JFK of course, they simply can not get enough. </p>
