      <h1>Parents labelled 'peak stupid' after giving their daughter a 'blended' surname</h1>
      <h2>The parents' decision to combine their last names to create their daughter's surname has been criticised - but others think it's 'lovely'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:21:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:21</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>More and more parents are opting to give their offspring unusual names to ensure they stand out from the crowd.</p>
      <p>While some go for alternative spellings of classics, others take no chances to make sure there won't be another child in the class with the same name by calling them something like <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/parenting-site-ranks-worst-baby-20867044">'Kingmessiah' or 'Danger'</a> .</p>
      <p>The brave choices are often pretty hit and miss, as one mum found out when her choice was given the unfortunate crown of ' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/mum-chooses-popular-name-daughter-8207381">worst name of 2019</a> '.</p>
      <p>Having 'always loved the name Kaitlyn but hated how popular it was', she found a way to make it her own - by substituting in the the Roman numeral for eight so it became 'KVIIIlyn'.</p>

      <p>A couple from Sydney have recently divided opinion by giving their daughter a 'blended surname', giving her a last name which is a mash-up of both of theirs.</p>
      <p>Parents Courtney and Laura decided they wanted to give their little girl Lyla a combination of both of their surnames, Cassar and Sheldon, to give her the last name 'Casseldon'.</p>
      <p>Explaining how they love the modern moniker, Courtney said:  "I like the idea of our daughter having a part of both of us," as reported by the <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=DTWEB_WRE170_a_NEW&amp;dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnews%2Fnsw%2Faussie-parents-giving-their-newborns-blended-last-names%2Fnews-story%2Fdac6c5f3946e2b2bfe45c73f21a67271&amp;memtype=anonymous&amp;mode=premium&amp;nk=2ad28540fa0fc37885573d7e541f28f7-1574085132">Daily Telegraph</a> .</p>
      <p>“With hyphens (double barrel surnames) I find a lot of kids end up choosing one name because it is easier.</p>
      <p>“We played around with a few last names and found one that we like and sounds like a last name.”</p>
      <p>The move split opinion online, which varied from those who thought it was 'lovely' to others who said it was 'ridiculous'.</p>
      <p>One said: “This is peak stupid.”</p>
      <p>Another replied: “Family trees are going to get much harder in the future."</p>
      <p>A third defended the decision, arguing: "It's the parents right to name their children anything they like."</p>
