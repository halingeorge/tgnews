      <p>Ford dropped the Mustang Mach-E (don’t forget the hyphen or you’ll get a personal visit from Jim Hackett himself) in L.A. last night, marking another chapter in what can only be called <i>Adventures in Branding</i>.</p>
      <p>It isn’t the first time a company has tried to mine the credibility of an established name when introducing a new car. This new EV from the Blue Oval certainly ranks in the top 10 examples of this practice. There are plenty more, of course. What one sticks out in your mind?</p>
      <p>Using a name from a brand’s heritage isn’t always a bad idea. Putting the Dart badge on Dodge’s then-new econobox a few years ago made some sense, given it was a entry-ish model back in the day. Plus, it sounded good, as alliteration often does.</p>
      <p>When Chevy put the Nova name on a rebadged economy car, though, that was a different story. Simply appending “II” onto an existing name has always struck me as odd; I guess “Bronco Junior” didn’t play well in focus groups.</p>
      <p>Will the Mustang Mach-E fall in the former or latter group? Only time will tell. Until then, sound off in the comments about your most loved or most reviled nameplate redux.</p>
