      <p>Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey are ready to start for Wales in Tuesday’s crucial Euro 2020 qualifier against Hungary, manager Ryan Giggs has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid forward Bale made his first appearance in a month in the 2-0 win over Azerbaijan on Saturday, a result that kept alive Wales’ hopes of qualifying automatically for next year’s tournament.</p>
      <p>Bale, who has been struggling with a calf injury, was replaced in the second half by Juventus midfielder Ramsey, who has been hampered by recent thigh trouble.</p>
      <p>Giggs expects to be able to have both players in the starting line-up for the first time in their qualifying campaign when they face Hungary in Cardiff, a match in which the winners will secure a place at the Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a few players who played 90 minutes for the first time against Azerbaijan, so it is important they get the recovery in over the next few days,” Giggs said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The lads who got minutes needed minutes. It’s a bit of a balancing act, the players I know who can’t play 90 minutes – that will obviously influence the selection.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, [Bale and Ramsey] are both ready to start. Gareth and Aaron, with Chris Mepham and Ethan Ampadu, all players who haven’t had an awful lot of football, got the minutes they needed.</p>
      <p>“We were able to get Gareth off and it was important to get Aaron on the pitch. Everyone in the squad is available to start.”</p>
      <p>Giggs has challenged his players to capitalise on the good fortunate of Croatia’s win over Slovakia on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The World Cup finalists came from a goal down to win 3-1 and book their own place at Euro 2020, while also ensuring Wales and Hungary have their fates in their own hands.</p>
      <p>“We had the high of winning the game but when Slovakia go ahead you are fearing the worst, but Croatia are fantastic at home,” Giggs said.</p>
      <p>“They showed their quality. We needed favours and we got those favours. Now it is time for us to capitalise.</p>
      <p>“It’s in our hands. It’s a great, exciting challenge for us but we need to finish the job – it will be a very, very difficult game.”</p>
