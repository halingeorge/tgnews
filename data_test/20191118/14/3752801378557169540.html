      <p>Four people were shot dead and six others wounded while watching a football game in the backyard of a central California home on Sunday, police said.</p>
      <p>Police were called to the scene after at least one person opened fire into a crowd of about 35 people gathered outside the house in Fresno, around 320km north of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>"Three people died on scene," Fresno deputy police chief Michael Reed told reporters, adding that a fourth was rushed to hospital in critical condition and succumbed to his injuries there.</p>

      </p>
      <p>All four of the dead and the six treated for "non life-threatening" gunshot wounds were men aged between 25 and 35, Reed said.</p>
      <p>"Our heart goes out to the families of the victims... this is senseless violence, he added.</p>
      <p>"We are doing everything we can to bring the perpetrators to justice."</p>
      <p>Reed said it was unclear how many perpetrators had been involved in the shooting and that there was "no indication" the incident was gang-related.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Bill Dooley said officers were looking for surveillance footage and witnesses to track the suspects.</p>
      <p>Choua Vang, who lives near the site of the attack, said that Sunday's incident was the second shooting in the area in as many weeks.</p>
      <p>"It makes me feel unsafe to be outside when the sun's down," he told the Fresno Bee newspaper.</p>
