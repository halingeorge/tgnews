      <p>No episode of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-harry-styles-knows-drug-dealing-is-difficult.html"><i>Saturday Night Live</i></a><i> </i>would be complete without a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/cut-for-time-kyle-mooney-sketch-is-about-new-snl-cast-member.html">“Cut for Time” sketch starring Kyle Mooney</a>, so while “Jason” didn’t make it into the live show during <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-recap-season-45-episode-6-harry-styles.html">Harry Styles’s episode</a>, it’s still very much worth the watch. In the pretaped music video, Mooney plays a decidedly <i>not </i>cool older brother named Scotty, who raps about what it’s like to be a high-school senior who gets bullied while his younger brother, Jason (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-harry-styles-dog-boyfriend-sketch-video.html">Styles</a>), has a very different experience as an extremely cool freshman. With a little bit of help from his friend Colby (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-harry-styles-knows-drug-dealing-is-difficult.html">Chris Redd</a>), Scotty insists that he doesn’t care about whether or not he’s cool and that “cool,” to him, is doing stuff like drawing castles, “reading for pleasure,” and following the rules — just don’t bring up the wrestling-team thing because he’s still pretty hurt about that. Jason also gets a turn to rap and explain himself, and in his defense, he may be pretty cool, but he’d also give away all of his coolness to be just a little bit more like his big bro, whom he loves very much. Also, he’s had sex, just FYI.</p>
