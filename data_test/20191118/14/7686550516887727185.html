        <figcaption>Meet the Welsh National Lottery Millionaires</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Welsh lottery winners have revealed how the money has brought them fantastic homes, dream holidays and even a longed-for child.</p>
      <p>Some of the winners from the past 25 years joined a glamorous line-up in a Vanity Fair inspired photo-shoot as they celebrated a quarter century of The National Lottery. With winnings worth more than £40 million between them, the 11 lucky individuals gathered to share tips and reveal how their lives have been transformed by their win.</p>
      <p>An incredible 5,500 millionaires have been created by The National Lottery since it launched and this series of shots at Hensol Castle – one of Wales’ most exclusive locations.</p>
      <p>The line-up includes millionaires like Louise Haran and Siân Jones from The Catering Girls syndicate, Port Talbot who each won a sixth of a whopping £25,476,778.30 back in 2017.</p>
      <p>And Jeff and Davinia Pritchard whose £1million win mean they were able to pay for surgery for their daughter that meant she was able to have a much-longed for child who was born earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The winners photographed were kitted out for this special 25th shot by Welsh celebrity stylist and S4C presenter Huw ‘Fash’ Rees from Llandeilo.</p>
      <p>The 25th National Lottery Birthday Wales line-up includes:</p>
      <h3>Geraldine, Barry and Chris Bradley</h3>

      <p>The 50-year-old mum-of-two, from Llanarthne, Carmarthenshire, was selected to feature as a representative for Wales in the national photo shot. <br/><br/>Geraldine’s grandfather-in-law Bob won £3.5million in March 2006 and gave £1million each to her father-in-law Barry and the same to her husband Chris before he <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/lottery-winner-dies-after-best-2258110">sadly passed away aged 84.</a></p>
      <p>Barry said: “Dad’s lucky win had been absolutely life changing for the whole family. As soon as Dad found out he had won, he quickly said that he wouldn’t be spending any of the money on himself and would instead secure the financial futures of his family and friends, which is exactly what he’s done. <br/><br/>“I retired at 61, and my son Chris and his family bought a beautiful home, as well as going on lots of lovely holidays. The best thing about the money has been the time it has given us to all spend together as a family.”</p>
      <h3>Jeff and Davinia Pritchard</h3>

      <p>The Carmarthen, won £1million in June 2015 from the EuroMillions Millionaire Maker, and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/couple-won-1-million-euromillions-9509375">celebrated with a Chinese takeaway.</a> <br/><br/>Davinia said: “Following our win, the first thing we did was book a holiday to Florida with our family, as well as treating ourselves to a new car. <br/><br/>“In the years since, Jeff has retired from his job, and I’m working reduced hours for the Welsh Ambulance Service.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps the best thing that this win has brought us, is the ability to pay for our daughter to have weight loss surgery, which has meant that she's now able to have children – her first long awaited baby was born last week (Nov 10) and as a family, we are absolutely over the moon. This is our fourth granddaughter. <br/><br/>“Life was very different for us 25 years ago, with us both working and busy raising our three children – a lot more hectic than it is now!” <br/><br/>Davinia says her and Jeff’s magic number is 38 as they will be celebrating 38 years of marriage in March.</p>
      <h3>William and Sophie Richards</h3>

      <p>The Swansea <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/couple-picked-up-1m-lottery-14690726">couple won £1millon on Lotto</a> after calling into their local shop for some mushy peas. They have four children and run an online store selling wrestling figures. <br/><br/>Will, 33, said: “The first thing we did when we won was pay off the mortgage and upgrade the car. We didn’t have much chance to relax, as two weeks after our win, we found out we were pregnant with our fourth child! <br/><br/>“We’ve been running our online business – www.toysandmasks.com - for quite a few years now and our win has allowed us to spend more time with the kids. We also enjoy buying the children nice clothes and Sophie is really loving building her designer handbag collection. We bought Sophie’s brother a car; her nan a new kitchen and have taken the family on a few holidays, including Disney Florida. I’ve also treated my son Harry to hospitality and to being a mascot at Swansea City football matches! <br/><br/>“Twenty five years ago, I was just eight years old and never thought I would be in this position today.”</p>
      <p>William’s lucky number is four, in honour of their four children.</p>

      <p>The former childminder from Cardiff was <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/couple-just-won-1-million-10978110">another £1million Lotto winner.</a></p>
      <p>She said: “Before our win, I ran a childminding business, which I really enjoyed, but the money has meant that I can focus my attention on looking after my husband Barrie, who has had the respiratory illness Sarcoidosis for many years. <br/><br/>“We’ve also been lucky enough to celebrate Barrie’s 50th with a dream family holiday to Disney Florida – it really was the holiday of the lifetime. The win has given us security for the future but really hasn’t changed us though – we still enjoy shopping in Matalan! <br/><br/>“Twenty five years ago, I had been married for a year and didn’t think I would ever win anything on the lottery, apart from £10 or so, so £1million came as quite a surprise!” <br/><br/>Michelle says her magic number is 3, as it was the date of her wedding.</p>
      <h3>Nigel Willetts</h3>

      <p>The 53-year-old, from Bedwas, Caerphilly, scooped £1 million on EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle on <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/friday-13th-turns-luckiest-day-7280424">Friday 13th June, 2014.</a> <br/><br/>Nigel said: “Friday 13th may be unlucky for some, but it certainly wasn’t for me! I’ve counted 13 as my lucky number ever since. <br/><br/>“Since winning, I’ve been able to invest in a trampoline park business, which is doing really well. I’ve also been able to put some money into the pub I owned before the win, so it’s been great to see that develop into something I’m really proud of. My next plan is to buy a property in Benidorm which I’m really looking forward to. <br/><br/>“Twenty five years ago, I was married with young children, and never would have imagined I would be in this position today.”</p>

      <p>The 56-year-old was one of a six-strong syndicate – The Catering Girls - at Neath Port Talbot Hospital, who won a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/live-updates-identities-25m-euromillions-13873665">£25.4million EuroMillions jackpot in November 2017.</a> <br/><br/>Sian said: “The win has completely changed all of our lives. It has given us the freedom to spend so much more time with our families and have experiences that we never could have afforded before. <br/><br/>“We have just celebrated the second anniversary of our win, and all got together to toast the occasion. We still really enjoy getting together a few times a year to share what we’ve all be up to.” <br/><br/>“Twenty five years ago I had just had my second child and was working as a lollipop lady.”</p>
      <p>This month marks 25 years since the launch of The National Lottery. Following the first draw on 19 November 1994, The National Lottery has paid out more than £71 billion in prizes. It’s not just the lives of individuals that have changed, a massive £40 billion has been raised helping support thousands of projects and charities, transforming communities across the UK.</p>
      <p>To celebrate 25 years of The National Lottery, a special £25m Birthday Lotto Jackpot is up for grabs and must be won on Saturday, November 23.</p>
