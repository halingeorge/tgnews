      <h1>Now de-cluttering queen Marie Kondo wants to sell you stuff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:40:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Bailey-Millado</a></address>
      <p>First, she came for your clutter — now she wants to sell you housewares.</p>
      <p>Marie Kondo — who became a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/marie-kondos-doing-what-she-can-to-make-your-kids-tidy/">pop culture sensation</a> with a series of books, YouTube tutorials and her hit “Tidying Up” Netflix series — launched an <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/">online shop</a> Monday where you can stock up on candles, linen robes, kitchen and bath wares, home décor and, yes, books.</p>
      <p>That’s a far cry from what some critics <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/04/22/tim-gunn-is-no-fan-of-marie-kondo-i-dont-subscribe-to-her-methods/?_ga=2.12971700.2080957074.1574079685-2052903110.1562695535">suggest was a long con</a> — aka “Kon Mari” — which featured the 35-year-old Japanese decluttering expert tweely prodding people into piling up their belongings and tossing out anything that doesn’t “spark joy.”</p>
      <p>Despite claims that she <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/06/17/celebrity-organizer-claims-tidying-up-star-marie-kondo-stole-her-method/?_ga=2.72295696.2080957074.1574079685-2052903110.1562695535">co-opted a concept</a> created by celebrity organizer Linda Koopersmith, Kondo has sold more than 11 million copies of her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308?tag=nypost-20">“The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing.”</a></p>
      <p>Now, her new website’s homepage hypes, “Our goal is to help more people live a life that sparks joy, and we are committed to offering the simplest, most effective tools and services to help you get there.”</p>
      <p>Items range from the low-end — a minimalist $8 <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/products/konmari-table-notary-ceramics-ceramic-chopstick-rest?_pos=1&amp;_sid=fd6f0eae0&amp;_ss=r">ceramic chopstick rest</a> — to full-on luxury goods: a $275 brass <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/products/konmari-kitchen-futagami-brass-tool-holder">kitchen utensil caddy</a> by Japanese designer Oji Masanori.</p>
      <p>Of course, as Kondo <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marie-kondo-adds-an-e-commerce-shop-to-her-site-11574053200">told the Wall Street Journal</a>, she would never suggest “over-purchasing anything.</p>
      <p>“What’s most important to me is that you surround yourself with items that spark joy,” she said. “If the bowl that you’re using currently sparks joy for you, I don’t encourage replacing it at all.”</p>
