      <h1>Troy Aikman Has A Message For Jerry Jones About Dak Prescott</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:19:58+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Dak Prescott continued to light up the stat sheet on Sunday afternoon, as the Dallas Cowboys quarterback put up monster numbers in a win over the Detroit Lions. Prescott threw for 444 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 35-27 victory in Detroit.</p>
      <p>It’s been a monster year for Prescott, who’s on pace for a record-setting Cowboys season.</p>
      <p>The timing could not be better for the former Mississippi State QB, who’s playing in the final year of his contract. He’s going to get paid in a major way.</p>
      <p>Even former Cowboys star Troy Aikman agrees with that.</p>
      <p>“I say pay the man,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Jerry Jones is going to pay his quarterback. It’s just a question of how much – and when – at this point.</p>
      <p>Prescott and the Cowboys appear to be comfortable waiting until the offseason to get a deal done. It’s possible Dallas will give him the franchise tag for 2020, though both sides would likely prefer to work out a longterm deal.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys are now just focused on winning the NFC East. Dallas holds a one-game lead in the division and is set to play at New England this Sunday.</p>
