      <p><b>WINTER IN <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/vogue/">VOGUE</a>:</b> Winter is officially in full swing — even though it seemed like some of the guests at the <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/media/bustle-uk-pulls-new-executive-editor-vogue-international-1203369834/">Vogue</a> Fashion Festival cocktail on Friday didn’t get the memo.</p>
      <p>“We obviously still think it’s summer,” said designer Simon Porte <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/jacquemus/">Jacquemus</a>, looking down at his outfit. (He was wearing a beige flower-print shirt and light colors, while model Mica Arganaraz, who was hanging on his arm, was dressed head-to-toe in white.)</p>
      <p>The model’s outfit hinted at <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/apc-cafe-paris-coffee-shop-1203368253/">Jacquemus</a>’ personal tip to beat the winter blues. “Wear white — it’s seasonless,” the designer said. “Trick yourself into thinking it’s warmer.”</p>
      <p>Guests shrugged off their heavy winter coats and stepped into the elaborately decorated salon of the Hôtel Potocki to celebrate the first day of the Vogue Fashion Festival, a series of talks on Nov. 15 and 16 organized by the Condé Nast publication.</p>
      <p>Nadja <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/swarovski-2/">Swarovski</a>, Vogue U.K. editor in chief <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/edward-enninful/">Edward Enninful</a>, <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/galeries-lafayette/">Galeries Lafayette</a> chief executive officer Nicolas Houzé, fashion show producer Alexandre de Betak and Dior Joaillerie creative director Victoire de Castellane all attended the candlelit event.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wwd.com/tag/bella-hadid/">Bella Hadid</a> was still reeling from her talk at the festival that morning, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/bella-hadid-never-felt-powerful-in-victorias-secret-shows-1203371806/">during which she was surprisingly candid about her mental health issues</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s always important to speak from the heart,” said the model, moments before posing for photographers with Vogue Paris editor in chief Emmanuelle Alt. “All I can say is — be yourself.”</p>
      <p>Past <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/jeanne-damas/">Jeanne Damas</a> and <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/caroline-de-maigret/">Caroline de Maigret</a>, Ludovic de Saint Sernin was sporting an elegant silk jumpsuit with a deep decolletage. “Wear sexy stuff,” said the men’s wear designer <a href="https://wwd.com/runway/mens-spring-collections-2020/paris/ludovic-de-saint-sernin/review/">known for his sensual silhouettes and cheeky men’s briefs</a>, when asked how he cheers himself up in chilly November. “Bare your chest all year round.”</p>
      <p>Natacha Ramsay-Levi, creative director of Chloé, prefers to embrace the colder weather once it’s there. “A roaring fire and orange peels always work,” the designer said. “Or you could just slip on a pair of rubber boots with thick soles and go for a walk in the rain. Face the bad weather, and finally find it charming.”</p>
      <p>Julien Dossena was a bit less optimistic. “Leave Paris,” said the creative director of <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/paco-rabanne/">Paco Rabanne</a>, fresh out of his Vogue talk with French journalist Loïc Prigent. “I’m from Brittany so I’m familiar with gray weather — sometimes the only option is to leave for a while.”</p>
