      <p>Two Forest department staff, Forest Guard Nagaraj and Anti-Poaching Watcher Muthusamy, were injured when they were chased by a wild elephant on Monday.</p>
      <p>“They were engaged in driving the male elephant, which had entered a patta land near Thandikudi in Batlagundu range of Dindigul forest division, when the animal turned against them and chased them,” said Dindigul District Forest Officer C. Vidya.</p>
      <p>Though the duo managed to escape from the wild elephant, they fell down while running away and suffered minor injuries. “They were treated for bruises at Thandikudi Government Hospital,” said the DFO.</p>
      <p>Last week, a woman, working in an estate in Kavichikombu area of Kannivadi range, was killed in an attack by a wild elephant.</p>
