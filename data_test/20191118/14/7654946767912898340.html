      <h1>Trump says he will ‘strongly consider’ testifying at impeachment hearings</h1>

      <p>President Trump on Monday insisted he would “strongly consider” testifying <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/what-would-happen-if-trump-is-impeached/">at the impeachment hearings.</a></p>
      <p>Trump made the suggestion during a tweet attack on “Crazy, Do Nothing” House Speaker “Nervous Nancy Pelosi,” who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/nancy-pelosi-says-president-trump-so-much-worse-than-richard-nixon/">challenged him to testify in interviews Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>“She also said I could do it in writing,” Trump said, calling the inquiry the “phony Impeachment Witch Hunt.”</p>
      <p>“Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196425928768929792">insisted Monday morning</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump’s <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196425921802178560">tweet also suggested</a> that Pelosi is “petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they &amp; Fake News Media are her BOSS).”</p>
      <p>And he called CBS’ “Face the Nation” — the show Pelosi appeared on on Sunday — “DEFACE THE NATION.”</p>
      <p>Pelosi had challenged the president to speak amid ongoing criticisms that the hearings are too one-sided and do not give him a fair shot.</p>
      <p>“The president could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants — if he wants to take the oath of office or he could do it in writing,” she said.</p>
      <p>“He has every opportunity to present his case,” she said, also calling him “<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/nancy-pelosi-says-president-trump-so-much-worse-than-richard-nixon/">so much worse” than Richard Nixon.</a></p>
