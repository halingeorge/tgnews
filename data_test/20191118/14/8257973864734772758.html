      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- T-Mobile CEO John Legere will leave the post in six months and will be replaced by executive Mike Sievert, the company said Monday.</p>
      <p>The mobile carrier announced the long-expected move, which will see Sievert ascend from the post of chief operating officer. He was also a member of the board of directors.</p>
      <p>"John Legere has had an enormously successful run as CEO," said Tim Hottges, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's parent company. "As the architect of ... the company's complete transformation, John has put T-Mobile U.S. in an incredibly strong position."</p>
      <p>Sievert oversees T-Mobile's marketing, retail sales and customer support groups.</p>
      <p>"I hired Mike in 2012 and I have great confidence in him," Legere said. "He is absolutely the right choice."</p>
      <p>Sievert will take over as CEO on May 1.</p>
      <p>The move comes as T-Mobile awaits final approval for its $26 billion acquisition of Sprint. The merger has cleared regulatory hurdles, but is being evaluated in U.S. courts over objections from several states aiming to block the deal on anti-trust grounds.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile and Sprint announced last week they will build a new Customer Experience Center in Nassau County, N.Y. The facility is expected to create 1,000 jobs.</p>
