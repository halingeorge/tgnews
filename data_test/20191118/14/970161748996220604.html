      <p>A father has waived his anonymity and spoken out after losing his right testicle in a botched operation.</p>
      <p>Bill Murray, 62, had no idea surgeons were planning to remove his testicle when he underwent a second operation at Furness General Hospital, in Cumbria, in April, to reduce swelling from his scrotum.</p>
      <p>An initial hydrocele repair performed by urologist Ashutosh Jain had failed to drain the swelling and had led to his testicle becoming black and gangrenous.</p>
      <p>After the first surgery, the dad-of-two woke up to find a vacuum drain had been inserted and left underneath the skin.</p>
      <p>He said this was not checked or emptied for 24 hours and after two days he was rushed back for another operation.</p>
      <p>But this time when he woke up he was shocked to see his right testicle was missing.</p>

      <p>The hydrocele repair procedure typically takes around 30 minutes and rarely results in complications.</p>
      <p>His first operation was carried out by under-fire consultant urologist Ashutosh Jain, who resigned last October, who has been responsible for other errors leading to patient harm and in two cases contributed to patient deaths.</p>
      <p>Two other consultant urologists at the hospital have also been responsible for errors over the last 18 years.</p>
      <p>Mr Murray, who had to stay in the hospital for 12 days, said: ‘I’m absolutely disgusted. I hold the surgeon Mr Jain fully responsible for all this.’</p>

      <p>University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust launched an investigation after Mr Murray complained.</p>
      <p>The report released today revealed several faults with the way he was treated.</p>
      <p>It said there was a missed opportunity to do a bladder scan when Mr Murray complained of pain and an inability to urinate and he was not advised of the risks of the operation.</p>
      <p>The report added policy wasn’t followed in escalating the patient to the medical team when he began experiencing pain and other complications.</p>
      <p>Finally, the report found medical records from doctors’ assessments and ward rounds had since ‘gone missing’.</p>
      <p>UHMBT medical director Dr Shahedal Bari added: ‘We are very sorry for the distress the patient suffered, and for the length of time it has taken to complete this investigation.</p>
      <p>‘We have shared our findings with the patient and will remain in touch with him. We would be happy to meet the patient to discuss any concerns.</p>

      <p>‘The process is not completed yet as an external review will be considered and team lessons will be discussed, in particular around improving record keeping and not missing opportunities to scan patients in this situation.’</p>
