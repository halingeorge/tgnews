      <h1>David McCracken and Lee Miller set to answer Falkirk SOS as former Bairns duo poised for interim role</h1>
      <h2>Ray McKinnon was sacked by the Bairns on Saturday with their League One title push faltering.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:00:33+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Falkirk are set to plug their managerial gap by appointing David McCracken and Lee Miller on an interim basis.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understands the former Bairns duo are poised to step in following Ray McKinnon's sacking on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>And an announcement could be made later on Monday afternoon before the hunt for a permanent boss is stepped up.</p>
      <p>McCracken, who spent four seasons with the club, currently plays for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/peterhead-fc">Peterhead</a> where he has also taken up a coaching role under manager Jim McInally.</p>

      <p>Miller, meanwhile, is backup striker at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> having plied his trade at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk-fc">Falkirk</a> between 2015 and 2018.</p>
      <p>They could be tasked with steadying the ship following McKinnon's departure, sparked by a disappointing 1-1 draw away at Dumbarton.</p>
      <p>The result left the stuttering <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/spfl-league-one">League One</a> title favourites down in fourth and angry supporters had to be restrained by stewards as McKinnon and his players left the pitch at half-time.</p>
      <p>It followed a home defeat to league leaders Airdrie the previous week, with the Bairns going down 2-1 in the 93rd minute.</p>
