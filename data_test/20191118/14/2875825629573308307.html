      <h1>Alby Mathewson to leave Munster after Racing 92 game</h1>
      <h2>The former All Black scrum-half has been consistently impressive over the 15 months he has been with the province</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:03:57+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Alby Mathewson will play for Munster for the last time against Racing 92 at Thomond Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The former All Black scrum-half has been consistently impressive over the 15 months he has been with the province, providing excellent cover for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-murray">Conor Murray</a>.</p>
      <p>But following the signing of Nick McCarthy from Leinster in the summer, and the emergence of Craig Casey and Jack Stafford, Mathewson was aware that he was unlikely to get what was initially a short term contract extended still further.</p>
      <p>Mathewson, 33, showed his worth by helping to steer the Reds in the dying moments to a bonus point victory against the Ospreys in the first round of the Champions Cup last Saturday.</p>
      <p>"Just want to say thank you to the whole @Munsterrugby organisation for having me," tweeted Mathewson this morning.</p>
      <p>"I'm lucky to have played for such a world class and historical club. Love my team mates and will miss them a lot.</p>
      <p>"Thanks Limerick for having me. To all the supporters you guys are unreal".</p>
