      </p>
      <p>On Saturday, photographer Nan Goldin and the opioid activist group P.A.I.N. staged a die-in at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London, calling attention to the institution’s educational center and courtyard named for the Sackler family. “This money must be clawed back to fund drug treatment, not decadent architecture,” the group wrote in a post on Instagram.
