      <p><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/days_gone">Days Gone</a> may not have been a huge hit with critics but the PlayStation 4 exclusive has enjoyed an impressive amount of success with the wider market -- and that's what counts when it comes to pitching sequels. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/days-gone-2-sequel-tease/">Speaking to GamesRadar</a> after <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/days_gone_is_playstation_game_of_the_year_at_this_years_golden_joystick_awards">Days Gone won PlayStation 4 Game of the Year</a> at The Golden Joystick awards, technical director Christopher Reese hints that there's potential for a Days Gone 2.</p>
      <p>Reese teases: "This is a world that we want to keep breathing more life into, and explore many, many different avenues. So who knows, we'll see!"</p>
      <p>While it's far from confirmation, it's clear that Days Gone is the game that Sony Bend wanted to make, and the studio has an obvious passion for it. And again, given how well Days Gone has sold up to this point, Sony may already be convinced that a sequel would be good business.</p>
