      <h2>Do you love cheese? Well, John does.</h2>

      <p>I sat down with John Mueller, a webmaster trends analyst at Google, to ask him questions that he often does not get on a daily basis. If you don’t know John and what the Webmaster Trends Analyst team does as Google, they basically spend a portion of their day helping webmasters and SEOs. In short, John spends a lot of time answering SEO and search-related questions.</p>
      <p>So instead of asking John SEO or search questions, I asked him about himself. At the end, we played a little game. I hope you enjoy this interview.</p>
