      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/alibaba">Alibaba </a>will close its order books early to prospective institutional investors as part of its $13.4 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>
      <p>Books will now be shut at 12 p.m. EST Tuesday in New York which is a half day earlier than initially planned by the Chinese e-commerce giant and its investment banking advisers.</p>
      <p>The decision was made by the company on Monday, and the final price will still be set by Wednesday evening, Hong Kong time, according to the sources.</p>
      <p>Alibaba's closing price on Tuesday in New York will be used to set the final price that institutional investors will pay for the Hong Kong listed stocks.</p>
      <p>Alibaba's listing comes amid Hong Kong anti-government protests which turned increasingly violent on the weekend.</p>
