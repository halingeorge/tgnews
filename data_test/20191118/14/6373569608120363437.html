      <p>Two brothers have faced a judge after a string of burglaries at ten homes across the South West where high-value cars were stolen.</p>
      <p>Jordan, aged 20, and 22-year-old Jacob Lemm, appeared in custody at Plymouth Crown Court charged with conspiracy to burgle.</p>
      <p>They allegedly plotted to raid four properties in Plymouth, one in Chudleigh, one in South Brent, one in Cornwood, one in Landulph and two in Weymouth.</p>
      <p>The pair allegedly took keys which they used to take a number of expensive vehicles, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/two-men-face-trial-over-3427363">including a Porsche 911 and an Aston Martin Vantage.</a></p>

      <p>The Lemms, both of Constantine Street, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/">Greenbank</a>, were not asked to enter pleas as they appeared from Exeter Prison over the videolink.</p>
      <p>Jason Beal, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said police and prosecutors needed more time to prepare the complex case.</p>
      <p>Judge Paul Darlow adjourned the hearing until January 16, when the pair are expected to enter pleas.</p>
      <p>He granted both men conditional bail.</p>
