      <p>Switzerland-based Nestlé, a food and drink processing conglomerate, has teamed up with Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, in order to “apply blockchain technology to infant nutrition for the first time.”</p>
      <p>According to a recent press release:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“After being the first to apply blockchain technology to a national brand with Moussline® purée, Nestlé and Carrefour, which continue to work together on the IBM Food Trust platform, announce the first use of blockchain technology for their GUIGOZ® Bio 2 and 3 infant milk range.” </i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The release stated that blockchain is a “major technological advance” and that it is expected to increase consumer confidence, as it will enhance transparency on product checks and origins. The platform is now available for “all GUIGOZ® Bio 2 and 3 packaging across sales channels,” the announcement noted.</p>
      <p>Carrefour and Nestlé have been working cooperatively to develop blockchain-powered solutions, with Carrefour sharing its “expertise as a pioneer of consumer-centred blockchain technology,” the release mentioned. It added that Nestlé will be sharing its supply and production data for GUIGOZ® BIO 2 and 3 products. Nestlé will also bring its experience of working as a founding member of the IBM Food Trust consortium.</p>
      <p>As noted in the release, the platform has been developed using IBM Food Trust’s technical solution, which has been created using Hyperledger’s distributed ledger technology.</p>
      <p>The release further stated:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“This three-way partnership builds on Carrefour’s Act For Food programme. Blockchain technology enhances transparency and advances the food transition for extremely high-quality products, which parents expect for infant nutrition.” </i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It added:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“For Nestlé and Laboratoires Guigoz, this innovative blockchain technology creates a new benchmark for transparency and the high standards of care required to ensure the quality of their products.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Infant milks produced by Laboratoires Guigoz, GUIGOZ® Bio 2 and 3 will be sold through all the normal distribution channels, which includes outside Carrefour stores.</p>
      <p>As noted in the release, providing greater transparency across the supply chain, “from dairy to shelf, helps build on the close relationship of trust between consumers and the brand.”</p>
      <p>It adds:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The blockchain technology applied to GUIGOZ® Bio 2 and 3 products from Laboratoires Guigoz highlights the expertise, know-how and care taken to ensure the quality of infant nutrition products.”</i>
