      <h2>Arhaan Khan had entered Bigg Boss 13 as a wild card but could not really make a mark in his two-week long stay.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:56:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sana-farzeen/" target="_blank">Sana Farzeen</a></address>
      <p>Host <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a> on Sunday evicted Arhaan Khan from Bigg Boss 13. The actor had entered the show as a wild card but could not really make a mark in his two-week long stay. Post his eviction, Arhaan spoke exclusively to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> and shared his disappointment.</p>
      <p>He shared, “Everyone who I am meeting is in shock, just like me. I still can’t comprehend what led to my eviction. I did so many tasks and I think it’s the first time in the history of the show that after winning a challenge, a housemate got eliminated. The journey was good but I wish it was long. There was so much more that I wanted to do in the show.”</p>
      <p>The Badho Bahu actor was rumoured to be dating co-contestant Rashami Desai. When asked if the lack of chemistry between them caused fans to not vote for him, Arhaan said, “Whatever feedback I have received is that they were really enjoying my time with Rashami. They were all rooting for us. The only problem is that I got eliminated too soon. Or else fans would have definitely seen a lot of us in the coming days.”</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old was recently given the title of Bol Bachchan on the show by fans. Stating that he accepted the title with pride, the actor said, “My game kickstarted the moment I entered the show. There were eight weird tags and everyone had to wear one. Earlier, the housemates had given the ‘Bol Bachchan’ title to Bhau but then it came to me. Honestly, I didn’t take it as an insult rather a compliment. It means someone who talks big, and I do. But I also have the confidence to stick on my words and do complete justice too.”</p>

      <p>In the last couple of days, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devoleena-bhattacharjee">Devoleena Bhattacharjee</a> has been flirting with Sidharth Shukla, and viewers have been enjoying the cute bonding between them. Interestingly, Devoleena had tried the same trick with Arhaan when she came back but he never responded to the same. When asked if he should have taken interest just to create some entertainment for fans, Arhaan Khan said, “Well, I have no regrets that we didn’t because whatever happened between us was real. I don’t want to comment on what’s happening between her and Shukla but our chemistry got built organically. Devoleena has become a great friend now. It’s just that I did not get much time to explore things in the house.”</p>
      <p>The Bigg Boss 13 house, as readers would know, has been clearly divided into two groups – Sidharth Shukla and Paras Chhabra’s. Whe quizzed if he got overshadowed by the two macho men, Arhaan said, “Not at all as I was not involved in any group and would chill with everyone. I had a great connect with Hindustani Bhau, Sana (Shehnaaz Gill) and even Arti Singh. It’s just that I knew Paras and Rashami before the show, so I would be seen more with them. I had even tried to sort the differences between Rashami and Sidharth but seeing their reaction to the same, I decided to let them be.”</p>
      <p>He also opened up about host Salman Khan, who is said to be too biased this season. He shared, “Bhai can never be biased. I have grown watching him, and he is the most special person in my life after my family. Honestly, one of the biggest reasons to do the show was that Salman Khan was hosting it. I can never speak ill of him and trust me, he can never be partial.”</p>
      <p>While Arhaan Khan was locked inside the house, an actor Amrita Dhanoa claimed that she was in a live-in relationship with him for five years, and he exploited her financially. Amrita even alleged that he has been using a false identity, as his real name is Mazhar Sheikh. Sharing his side of the story, Arhaan said, “I don’t think it’s worth speaking about it. The issue is that Bigg Boss is the biggest reality show in Asia, and everyone wants to get involved somehow with it. I don’t know any Amrita and haven’t even met her in my life. As for being Mazhar, well, many actors change their names, and so have I. This doesn’t make me a fraud.”</p>

        <b>Arhaan Khan’s quick takes:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Any regrets?</b> I didn’t deserve to get evicted this way, and this soon.</p>
      <p><b>Who do you feel can win the show?</b> The one who is genuine with a strong connect with the audience, and that’s Rashami Desai.</p>
      <p><b>A contestant you would never want to meet again?</b> No one. I am that kind of person who believes in being nice to everyone.</p>
      <p><b>The first thing you did after coming out of BB13 house?</b> I cried. I was really upset and couldn’t control my emotions.</p>
      <p><b>What would you miss the most?</b> Rashami for sure</p>
