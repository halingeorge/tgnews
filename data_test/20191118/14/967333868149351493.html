        <b>Hillel, the student movement that launched the movement to introduce kosher food, condemned the initial refusal as being anti-Semitic. Several days later, the student union said the email had been misinterpreted and agreed to support the bid.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union (UTGSU) was forced to apologise after it declined to back a kosher food campaign.</p>
      <p>Hillel, a Jewish student group at the university, had asked the UTGSU through a member of the union’s board of directors to back the Kosher Forward campaign, which seeks to provide <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201812311071130222-belgium-kosher-halal-meat/">kosher food options</a> on campus.</p>
      <p>In an emailed response sent on 14 November, the UTGSU external commissioner said they wouldn’t push the motion forward because it would go against the “will of the membership” as a result of Hillel being “pro-Israel”.</p>
      <p>The UTGSU voted in 2012 to endorse the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, an international <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910291077174394-oslo-city-council-ponders-boycott-of-products-services-from-israeli-settlements/">campaign to boycott Israel</a> over its alleged oppression of the rights of Palestinians. The union is said to be the only student union in Canada with a committee dedicated to supporting BDS.</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards, Hillel condemned the emailed response as “a form of anti-Semitism”; the union's executive committee then issued an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/utgsu/photos/a.270832609697506/2572138109566933/?type=3&amp;theater">apology</a>.</p>
      <p>They explained that the external commissioner did not give the response on their behalf and that the commissioner “mistakenly insinuated” that the motion wouldn’t garner support further on.</p>
      <blockquote>They added that the UTGSU executive committee invited the UoT’s Hillel representatives and the board member who made the request to have a discussion on how to “remedy harm and how to mitigate future harm towards Jewish students on campus.”</blockquote>
      <p>To date, the external commissioner has offered to bring the motion forward through the UTGSU’s equity and advocacy committee “as a means for having the UTGSU support the Kosher Forward campaign,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>It concluded: “The UTGSU Executive Committee is deeply sorry for the harm that this response has caused.”</p>
