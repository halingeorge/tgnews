      <p><b>Toulouse:</b> A 15-year-old girl has died and several people are likely missing after a bridge collapsed into a river in south-western France.</p>
      <p>The 150 metre-long suspension bridge in Mirepoix-sur-Tarn, near Toulouse, collapsed on Monday as a lorry, car and possibly a van were crossing, the local prosecutor said. The bridge was limited to 19-tonne vehicles.</p>

      <p>Television images showed one car nose-down in the water, with only its rear lights and bumper above the surface.</p>
      <p>The mother of the dead teenager was among three people rescued from the water, the prosecutor added.</p>
      <p>The local prefect Etienne Guyot said the full number of casualties was not yet known.</p>
      <p>"There are probably several people missing, we can't yet determine how many," Guyot told reporters. "Our priority is to find these people."</p>

      <p>The bridge was inspected every six years and had shown no sign of structural weakness at its last inspection in 2017, the Haute-Garonne regional council said.</p>
      <p>Senators last year called for more money to check and repair bridges across France after the collapse of a motorway viaduct in Genoa, Italy, killed 43 people.</p>
