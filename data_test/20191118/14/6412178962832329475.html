        <b>Juventus defender Merih Demiral has been told by the club that he is free to look for a move away from Turin when the transfer window opens in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has only made one appearance in Serie A for Maurizio Sarri’s side so far this term having been unable to find game time ahead of the likes of Matthijs de Ligt and Leonardo Bonucci.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/juventus-ready-to-consider-offers-for-top-man-utd-arsenal-defensive-target"><b>Turkish international Demiral has been linked with both Manchester United and Arsenal in recent weeks</b></a> and, according to the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205624/Manchester-United-Arsenal-Merih-Demiral-Juventus-January-transfer-news?fbclid=IwAR1oy4lxyp2NxLAJnzvp9H0tzS4E1ijCZ5-0mIA5JhsA_BEbFrn-Bc_KBME"><b>Daily Express</b></a>, the Premier League duo have been handed a boost in their efforts to sign him.</p>
      <p>The newspaper says that should Demiral choose to leave the club, his employers will not stop him from trying to do so, with Sarri said to be happy with his current options at the back.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, who signed David Luiz from Chelsea in the summer, have been linked with bringing in another defender in January with their defence – which has shipped 17 goals in 12 Premier League games so far – coming in for criticism.</p>
      <p>As well as the Gunners and <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united"><b>United</b></a>, the Express adds that Manchester City are keeping a close eye on Demiral’s progress, with Aymeric Laporte set to be sidelined until early next year through injury.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/juventus-midfield-star-puts-man-utd-on-alert"><b>United have also been linked with Demiral’s teammate Emre Can, who has spoken out about his frustrations at his own lack of game time under Sarri</b></a>.</p>
