      <p>(CNN) — Thousands of Californians united in grief Sunday night to remember the young victims of the Saugus High School shooting.</p>
      <p>Many wore matching jerseys that read “S Strong,” a declaration of resilience after the Thursday’s attack that killed Grace Anne Muehlberger, 15, and Dominic Blackwell, 14.</p>
      <p>More than 10,000 mourners gathered at the vigil at Central Park in Santa Clarita, the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department said.</p>
      <p>Grace’s brother, Riley Muehlberger, broke down as he told the crowd about his “gorgeous, radiant, angelic, caring, intelligent and energetic” sister.</p>
      <p>“I watched you grow more and more every day,” he said.</p>
      <p>“My favorite about you, Gracie, was how funny you were. You were always able to put a smile on my face, and that’s one of the things I’ll miss the most,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Thank you for being the best sister ever. I wouldn’t want anyone else. Until I see you again, I love you, Gracie.”</p>
      <p>Mourners also grieved the death of Dominic, who was a member of the school’s Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC).</p>
      <p>“The school shooter took away one of my friends,” Andrew Gardetto said, according to <a href="https://ktla.com/2019/11/17/vigil-planned-for-victims-of-saugus-high-school-shooting-sunday-as-investigation-continues/">CNN affiliate KTLA</a>. “He injured me, he injured many people and he traumatized the entire school and community.”</p>
      <p>Authorities said the gunman, Nathaniel Berhow, took a .45-caliber pistol from his backpack at the quad area of the high school, about 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Investigators said he appeared to fire at random before shooting himself on his 16th birthday. He died the next day.</p>
      <p>The motive for the attack remains a mystery.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing really that stands out (with the suspect). He wasn’t a loner. Wasn’t socially awkward. Was involved in student activities. Student athlete,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said.</p>
      <p>“This is kind of out of the blue, shocking pretty much everyone who knew him.”</p>
      <p>There appears to be no connection between the shooter and the victims other than all were students.</p>
      <p>Saugus High School had an active shooter drill just a few weeks ago, the sheriff said. The faculty and students did exactly as they were trained, he said.</p>
