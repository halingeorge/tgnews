      <p>LEINSTER HAVE SIX players marked for further assessment with their medical team ahead of Saturday’s Heineken Champions Cup clash away to Lyon.</p>
      <p>Among them, Robbie Henshaw and Will Connors are expected to train in full this week.</p>
      <p>The flanker came through return to play protocols after a late head knock at the Sportsground last week. Henshaw made his return to provincial action in the bonus point win over Benetton as a late replacement in the 23 for Joe Tomane having missed out on the match in Galway. Tomane was withdrawn due to a tight hamstring.</p>
      <p>Caelan Doris failed a HIA during Saturday’s win over the Italian side and is in the midst of return to play protocols.</p>
      <p>Leinster will also hope for positive progress on Tadhg Furlong’s ‘minor back complaint’ and a shoulder knock for Rory O’Loughlin before before flying to France on Friday.</p>
      <p>Hooker Sean Cronin, meanwhile, will be cleared to work through an increased training load this week as he makes his way back from a neck injury.</p>
