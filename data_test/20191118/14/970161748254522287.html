      <p>The family of a sick infant are distraught after posters were erected in their hometown saying: ‘Stop asking for money. Let the baby die.’</p>
      <p>Those billboards, targeting the family of four month-old RJ Ahlers in Toledo, Ohio, continue: ‘Its (sic) called Darwinism. Happy Holidays.’</p>
      <p>RJ’s father KC says his family was targeted after he put up six signs at the local Franklin Park Mall last month detailing RJ’s condition and asking for help.</p>
      <p>He was stunned to see the troll boards placed directly under his own appeal – with an arrow pointing up – and said: ‘I came out. I saw it. Immediately took the one down.</p>
      <p>‘There were other ones that were up, but somebody, some other Good Samaritans kicked them down.’</p>

      <p>The baby suffers from a debilitating brain condition called Agenesis of the Corpos Callosum.</p>

      <p>The birth defects leaves sufferers without the corpus callosum – the band of white matter which connects the two hemispheres of the brain.</p>
      <p>RJ also suffers a rare genetic condition called Mosaic trisomy 9. That sees sufferers’ entire ninth chromosome appear three times – rather than the usual two – in some cells of the body.</p>
      <p>It leaves some sufferers with facial disfigurements, and intellectual disabilities. RJ also has a hole in his heart.</p>
      <p>Doctors have warned RJ’s family that just half of babies with Mosaic trisomy 9 live to the age of two.</p>

      <p>KC says the original posters he erected, as well as a superhero-themed fundraiser, netted around $4,000.</p>
      <p>The cash was spent on an expensive genetic test, with RJ’s family vowing to continue fundraising to give the baby the best chance possible.</p>
      <p>KC told <a href="https://www.13abc.com/content/news/Let-the-baby-die-sign-targets-local-baby-battling-rare-disorders-565015682.html">WTVG</a>: ‘We want to raise our son to not reciprocate hatred.</p>
      <p>‘We want to battle hatred with love.</p>
      <p>‘So, we obviously know somebody that did this is disturbed and we hope they get help.</p>

      <p>‘But, we’re going to keep taking your signs down as we see them because this town doesn’t need hatred.</p>
      <p>‘This town needs love.’</p>
      <p>RJ’s family are now planning another fundraiser for next month, and have set up a GoFundMe <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/rj-trisomy-9-syndrome">page</a> to raise further cash.</p>
