      <p>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) had an up-and-down weekend.</p>
      <p>Her Democratic presidential campaign <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879045/kamala-harris-receive-major-union-endorsement">received</a> a helpful endorsement, but reports of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/15/kamala-harris-campaign-2020-071105">internal strife</a> led to questions about the future of her White House bid. And while she <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/kamala-harris-california-dems-2020-drop-out-071329">reportedly received</a> some hearty support during her speech at the California Democratic convention on Saturday, some strategists in her home state think the clock is ticking for the senator, who was once considered a serious contender for the nomination, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/kamala-harris-california-dems-2020-drop-out-071329"><i>Politico</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>"Of course she should get out," <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/kamala-harris-california-dems-2020-drop-out-071329">said</a> one leading Democratic strategist who declined to speak on the record. "But who's gonna tell her?"</p>
      <p>Harris is struggling in the polls, but has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/kamala-harris-california-dems-2020-drop-out-071329">reportedly told</a> California insiders that she's not planning on dropping out of the race at least until after the Iowa caucus. But there are fears that even that could be too late and harm her reputation in the long run. "It's not happening," a leading grassroots organizer <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/kamala-harris-california-dems-2020-drop-out-071329">told <i>Politico</i></a> on the condition of anonymity. "She has her chance [to leave the race] ... she should take it."</p>
      <p>One person who isn't buying the rumors of Harris' demise is California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who felt no need to speak anonymously and said he thinks there's still time and space for the senator to get back in the race. "She's too talented to be dismissed — she's too capable," he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/kamala-harris-california-dems-2020-drop-out-071329">said</a>.
