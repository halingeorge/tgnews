      <p>A mum was horrified to find a live squirming maggot in a chocolate treat she bought for her two-year-old son.</p>
      <p>Evie Chisholm bought a net of Paw Patrol chocolate coins for Jacob from Morrisons in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/port-talbot">Port Talbot</a> on November 16, but got a shock as she unwrapped the foil.</p>
      <p>There, poking out of a small hole in the milk chocolate coin, was the glistening head of a maggot. The toddler, who loves Paw Patrol, had already polished off most of the coins before his mum made the gruesome discovery.</p>

      <p>Miss Chisholm said she felt sick at the thought the toddler may have already swallowed a maggot. She said: "I bought the chocolates from Morrisons in Baglan on Saturday when I saw the maggot.</p>
      <p>"I felt sick as my two-year-old son had already eaten half the pack and I was angry in case it made him ill as I didn't know if he had already eaten one."</p>
      <p>Little Jacob was unimpressed when his mum told him he couldn't have any more of his favourite treat, which is made by Italian company Walcor.</p>
      <p>Miss Chisholm, from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/neath">Neath</a> , checked the packaging for the best before date on the chocolates, which said September 2021.</p>

      <p>Keeping the last single coin, she decided to call the Morrisons store straight away to warn them about other products which potentially had the same problems.</p>
      <p>"I just wanted to make others aware of this," she added, warning others to keep their eyes peeled.</p>
      <p>Morrisons were contacted but said as it was not their product they would not comment.</p>
      <p>It is understood Walcor are to investigate the matter. The company has been approached for comment.</p>
