      <h1>England boss Gareth Southgate told he has 'missed the boat' with Jack Grealish omission</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa midfielder Grealish continues to be overlooked by England boss Southgate - and Tim Sherwood believes that is a mistake</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:33:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>England have “missed the boat” with Jack Grealish according to Tim Sherwood who has compared the Aston Villa ace to Paul Gascoigne.</p>
      <p>Former Villa boss Sherwood gave Grealish his full Premier League debut in April 2015 as the starlet flourished under him and helped them to the FA Cup final.</p>
      <p>The attacking midfielder, 24, has since blossomed into Villa's captain and has impressed in the Premier League this term with two goals and three assists after inspiring them to promotion.</p>
      <p>Grealish is the most fouled player in the top-flight ahead of Wilfried Zaha after also being singled out in the Championship.</p>
      <p>But the uncapped former England U21 ace continues to be overlooked by Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate.</p>

      <p>Sherwood reckons it is a mistake ahead of next summer's European Championships after comparing his ability to England legend Gazza.</p>
      <p>Sherwood, in charge at Villa Park from February 2015-October 2015, told TalkSport: “You have two friendlies in March but I think it may be a bit late for Jack.</p>
      <p>“I think we've missed a trick because this kid is special - 100% they missed the boat on him. This kid, the ball's his friend, he's something different.</p>
      <p>“Jack takes the ball to the opposition, he goes right at the heart of people, he dribbles like Paul Gascoigne.</p>
      <p>“He's got a long way to go before he's anywhere near Paul Gascoigne but he can see the play.</p>
      <p>“He's the most fouled player in any league he ever plays in because he creates a melee but he sees the pass and releases it at the right time.</p>
      <p>“Yes, he's got to add more goals to his game, he won't ever score as many as Mason Mount but what he does is release players with freedom because he creates such a crowd around him.</p>
      <p>"He's quicker with the ball than he is without it and that's a mindset. If we're out of possession, yes he needs to get himself back around.</p>
      <p>“But if he's [Gareth Southgate's] going to play a six with two eights I would definitely be playing him. Id' be playing Mount and Grealish either side of Harry Winks.”</p>
