PG&amp;amp;E says it could cut off power to a large swath of Northern California later this week to prevent its equipment from starting wildfires during hot, windy weather. The utility says power could be shut off in 30 counties in central and Northern California starting Wednesday, Oct. 9, when hot weather and strong winds are forecast, and through Thursday.

      <p>Before high winds pick up around Northern California on Wednesday, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric may shut off power for approximately 750,000 California residents to mitigate wildfire risk.</p>
      <p>How do you know if and when PG&amp;E is shutting off your power?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Update your contact information to receive alerts</b>
      </p>
      <p>The utility company will notify customers at 48 hours, 24 hours and just prior to shutting off power. Alerts will be sent through automated calls, texts and emails.</p>
      <p>To update your contact information with PG&amp;E, you can call 866-743-6589. Even if you think PG&amp;E has your information, it's good to check in to make sure they have your specific address on record and not only your zip code.</p>
      <p>If your landlord is the account holder, they will receive the alerts and you will want to make sure they know to be in touch with you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Use PG&amp;E's planning tool, maps and new website</b>
      </p>
      <p>In three separate shutoffs in October, PG&amp;E's <a href="https://psps.ss.pge.com/">website</a> crashed repeatedly in high-traffic situations. The utility says their site has since been been bolstered to handle increased traffic.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E says its website dedicated to providing <a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/public-safety-event.page">power shutoff updates</a> is the best resource for the latest information<a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/public-safety-event.page">: You can visit it here.</a></p>
      <p>Here, you will also find a <a href="https://psps.ss.pge.com/">tool</a> that allows you to type in your address and learn in advance if your residence will be impacted.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/public-safety-event.page">Outage maps </a>will be posted on the website closer to the event.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Follow social media and news reports</b>
      </p>
      <p>PG&amp;E is also relaying shut-off information to media outlets and posting updates on social media. Most counties are sharing this information on their official county Twitter and Facebook accounts as well. If you're active on social media, it's helpful to follow these accounts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watch the weather</b>
      </p>
      <p>PG&amp;E meteorologists are closely monitoring weather conditions to make decisions on where and when power outages may occur. They're considering numerous factors to determine the severity of fire risk, including "Red Flag Warnings" issued by the National Weather Service, low humidity levels (generally below 20 percent), forecasted sustained winds (generally above 25 mph and wind gusts in excess of approximately 45 mph, depending on site-specific conditions such as temperature) and the moisture content of the surrounding landscape.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E posts regular weather forecasts on its <a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/psps-weather-map.page">website. </a>The <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hnx/severe">National Weather Service website</a> and Twitter accounts are other resources: Follow the Bay Area NWS Twitter account at <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBayArea?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@NWSBayArea</a>.</p>
