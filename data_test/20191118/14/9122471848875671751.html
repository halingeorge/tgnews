      <h1>Tom Brady Has Brutally Honest Comment On Patriots’ Offense</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:59:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The New England Patriots earned a 17-10 win over the Philadelphia Eagles yesterday, securing their ninth win and 19th consecutive winning season in the process. But it wasn’t one of the Patriots’ better offensive performances, and Tom Brady had a lot to say on the matter.</p>
      <p>In a Monday morning appearance on <i>The Greg Hill Show</i>, Brady was brutally honest in his assessment of the offense. He made it clear that the defense and special teams were the top units, and the offense needs to “take advantage of our opportunities.”</p>
      <blockquote>“The strength of our team is our defense and our special teams. So on offense, we’ve just got to take advantage of our opportunities and understand where our strengths lie and try to play to them.”</blockquote>
      <p>The Patriots are averaging over 28 points per game – still on pace for more than they scored last year. But in terms of yardage, they’re ranked 15th – on pace for their lowest ranking since 2003.</p>

      <p>Brady, to his credit, has been as efficient with the ball as ever. But he hasn’t been lighting up the scoreboard like he used to.</p>
      <p>None of that is to say that the Patriots won’t get back to the Super Bowl, let alone win it.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen the Patriots overcome way too much adversity to doubt them now.</p>
      <p>But it still bears paying attention to with games against the Cowboys, Texans, and Chiefs coming up soon.</p>
