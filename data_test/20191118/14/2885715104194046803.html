      <p>Three days after <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> MP <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/gautam-gambhir/">Gautam Gambhir</a> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/have-a-family-to-support-gautam-gambhir-hits-back-after-aap-trolls-him-for-skipping-pollution-meet-6121460/"><b>found himself in a political quagmire</b></a> for missing the parliamentary meeting on combating the national capital’s alarming levels of air pollution, the former cricketer clarified he was contractually obligated to be in Indore for the first Test match between India and Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>“I had signed the contract in January and I joined politics in April. Due to contractual obligation, I had to go for the commentary. On 11th November I received the mail and on the same day, I had informed them the reason for not attending the meeting, Gambhir was quoted as saying by ANI.</p>

      <p>Gambhir added that he knew that the meeting was very important but was ‘contractually bound’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/gautam-gambhir-skips-pollution-meet-faces-heat-6122122/"><b>AAP attacked</b> </a> the East Delhi MP Friday for skipping a crucial parliamentary committee meeting on the capital’s air crisis.</p>
      <p>Gambhir was in Indore as a commentator for the India-Bangladesh cricket series. A photo shared by former Indian cricketer V V S Laxman Friday showed him and Gambhir having <i>jalebis</i> — something the AAP based its attack on. “Our Hon’ble MP claims he skipped a meeting on air pollution in order to earn a living. In the same breath, he says he pledges his salary as an MP for his constituency. Going in circles like a jalebi to defend the indefensible,” Atishi had said, referring to Gambhir’s note on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Defending his absence from the meeting Gambhir retaliated Aam Aadmi’s Party’s attack on him and said:  “<i>Agar mera jalebi khane se Delhi ka pollution badha hai, toh main hamesha ke liye jalebi chhod sakta hoon…10 minute mein mujhe troll karna shuru kar diya, agar itni mehnat Delhi ki pollution ko kam karne mein ki hoti toh hum saas le pate </i>(If the pollution has risen because I was eating jalebis, then I can abstain from jalebis for ever. It took merely ten minutes for them to start trolling me. If this much effort was put to reduce the pollution levels in the city, then we would have been able to breathe,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
