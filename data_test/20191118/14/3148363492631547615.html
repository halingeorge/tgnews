      <p>The film starring Joaquin Phoenix features the origin story of the infamous Batman villain helmed by director Todd Phillips.</p>
      <p>CNN first <a href="https://twitter.com/ShimonPro/status/1196077108428181504">reported</a> the screening which was later <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-hosts-white-house-screening-of-joker-162846043.html">confirmed </a>to Yahoo News by a senior White House official who said that Trump liked the film.</p>

      <p><i>Joker</i> was released in October and has grossed over a billion dollars worldwide, making it one of the biggest surprise hits of 2019.</p>
      <p>Philips embraced criticism of “woke” Hollywood after releasing the movie, explaining why he shifted his filmmaking away from comedy,</p>
      <p>“Go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture,” Phillips said in an interview with <i><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/joaquin-phoenix-cover-story">Vanity Fair.</a></i> “There were articles written about why comedies don’t work anymore—I’ll tell you why, because all the fucking funny guys are like, ‘Fuck this shit, because I don’t want to offend you.’ It’s hard to argue with 30 million people on Twitter. You just can’t do it, right? So you just go, ‘I’m out.’”</p>
