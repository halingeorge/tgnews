      <h1>ESPN’s Stephen A Smith + Ava DuVernay Clash Over Colin Kaepernick: “You Don’t Want To Work, You Just Want To Make Noise – It’s Over”</h1>

      <p>ESPN’s <b>Stephen A. Smith</b> has no sympathy for <b>Colin Kaepernick</b>. The sports personality has come forward to dish his thoughts on the free agent quarterback’s publicized weekend NFL workout.</p>
      <p>This past weekend, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenasmith/status/1195866091068764160?s=19">Smith went online</a> to share his frustrations with Kaepernick appearing to use the workout as a publicity stunt.</p>
      <blockquote>“So let me get this straight. Colin Kaepernick has been working out all of this time. Him, people in his camp, his close ones, loved ones, everybody talking about, ‘He wants to play football. He wants to play football. He’s ready to play. Just give him the chance.’ So what does the NFL do? Recognizing that teams need a shield because they need something to hide behind because they know that guess what, if we bring this brother in for a workout and we don’t like it or we don’t want him, who knows what we’re going to get accused of – so the NFL provides that. I have no doubt JAY-Z’s involved. I have no doubt Roger Goodell’s involved, I have no doubt there’s a host of people involved but forget all that. This man wanted a chance, 25 teams show up in Georgia at the Atlanta Falcons facility – and what does Colin Kaepernick do? Not Tuesday when he found out about it. Not Wednesday, not Thursday, not Friday, Saturday. Three hours before the workout because of some issue with a liability waiver. Colin Kaepernick wants to change the venue, Colin Kaepernick wants his own receivers, Colin Kaepernick wants to video things himself, Colin Kaepernick wants the media. … Media can’t find him but he wants the media available. You see, you see, he don’t want to play. He wants to be a martyr. But guess what, it ain’t working this time. All of us believe Colin Kaepernick showed out and if he had showed out, I’m here to tell you I believe he would have had a job within two weeks. But it didn’t happen because he didn’t show. He wanted to show up to a high school in Georgia. Not an NFL facility. A high school and then YouTube it live like the average Joe out there.”</blockquote>

      <p>According to reports, the NFL <a href="https://www.sohh.com/j-cole-comes-to-colin-kaepernicks-defense-calls-himself-a-clown-for-believing-the-nfl-was-about-to-do-the-right-thing/">put together some last-minute</a>, dramatic requirements for Kaepernick’s Saturday workout.</p>
      <blockquote>While Kaepernick agreed to participate on Saturday (and did so within that arbitrary two-hour window), disputes soon arose between his camp and the NFL. League officials reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1194787406811213825">rescinded their offer to provide a list of team officials</a> who were planning to attend. On the day of the workout, it was announced that cameras—including Kaepernick’s own video crew—would not be allowed inside the Falcons’ facility and that the NFL would be providing video of the session after the fact. The NFL also asked Kaepernick sign a waiver that his attorneys described as “unusual.” He declined. (SLATE)</blockquote>
