      <p>Westlife fans tuned into Sunday night's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> results show in their droves to watch the Irish boy band perform a medley of their greatest hits.</p>
      <p>Shane Filan, Mark Feehily, Kian Egan and Nicky Byrne headed to Blackpool's Tower Ballroom for their first performance together in years.</p>
      <p>However, fans were left disappointed by their appearance.</p>

      <p>However, fans complained that they struggled to hear the crooners sing because the audience were clapping too loudly.</p>
      <p>"Just wish the audience didn’t clap the whole way through," said one Westlife fan on Instagram, adding the sad face emoji.</p>

      <p>Another added: "Sound terrible, and sick of hearing the screaming and shouting from the audience every week. Stop it happening. Spoilt Westlife's performance."</p>

      <p>"I agree," another fan replied. "Something wrong with the sound and I get cross when audiences cheer and clap dances while singers are performing."</p>

      <p>"Once again the audience spoils it with out of time clapping and unnecessary cheering at every move the dancers make!" raged another fan.</p>
      <p>Others said they "loved the dancing but thought the singing was awful".</p>
      <p>"So off key, made my ears bleed, ruined a Billy Joel song," said another Strictly viewer.</p>
      <p>Twitter users were divided over the performance, too.</p>
