      <p>No need to wait until <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday</a> to get a great discount on a pair of the Beats Solo 3 wireless headphones. You can grab them today for just $199. That's $150 off of their regular price. And Beats rarely discounts their headphones â€“ and when they do, it's normally around $50.</p>
      <p>The Beats Solo 3 are actually a really good pair of headphones. They aren't as bass-heavy as some of the older pairs of Beats headphones were. They are more balanced. So even if you don't listen to a lot of Hip Hop or Rap music, you're going to enjoy these headphones.</p>
      <p>There is of course, noise cancellation. Allowing you to really immerse yourself in your music and not hear anything around you. That can be toggled off. Which is a good idea for saving some battery.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Speaking of battery, these will last for around 22 hours of continuous playback. That's with noise cancellation on, so if you turn that off, it'll run even longer. There is also a fast charging feature available. Where you can charge them for 10 minutes and you'll get three hours of usage. Which is really nice for when the battery is low, and you're heading to the gym.</p>
      <p>These are made for Apple devices, with the W1 chip, which makes it super simple to pair. But these are still Bluetooth, so you're going to be able to use these with Android devices too. The only thing you're going to miss out on, is the fast pairing. Where you can turn them on and they'll automatically pair with your phone the first time.</p>
      <p>Of course, this is Bluetooth, so you're still going to be able to pair quickly, after you've paired them the first time.</p>
