      <h2>The 10-year-old's mum Kimberly Darroch claims her daughter died after contracting a dirty water infection at the hospital while in remission from cancer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:53:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman will be quizzed twice this week at Holyrood over the scandal of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432">10-year-old girl who died in Glasgow’s super hospital</a> .</p>
      <p>She'll will be grilled by MSPs over allegations cancer patient <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">Milly Main lost her life</a> after contracting a dirty water infection at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus.</p>
      <p>As revealed by the Daily Record, a whistleblower came forward to allege that a doctor-led probe at the QEUH found 26 cases of child cancer patients acquiring water infections in 2017.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It was also claimed that one of the patients, who this newspaper later revealed to be Milly, died after coming into contact with contaminated water at the facility. The findings were never published.</p>
      <p>In an interview, Milly’s mum Kimberly Darroch urged NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) to “stop lying” about her daughter and called on Freeman to tell the truth about the case.</p>
      <p>She also revealed that Milly, who had leukaemia, was in remission at the time when she got the infection, adding that she was “100 per cent” certain her daughter died due to infected water at the hospital.</p>

      <p>It also emerged at the weekend that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">three-year-old Mason Djemat</a> died in 2017 at the flagship hospital.</p>
      <p>Freeman has faced called for her resignation over the Milly scandal and Labour MSP Anas Sarwar, who was contacted by the whistleblower, has urged the Health Secretary to put NHSGGC into “special measures”. This means the Scottish Government taking a more direct role in the management of a chosen health board.</p>
      <p>Freeman, who has criticised the health board over its handling of the Milly case, will be quizzed tomorrow by MSPs on the Parliament’s Health and Sport committee.</p>
      <p>She is also expected to make a separate statement in the Holyrood chamber later in the week.</p>

      <p>Freeman said today: “Later this week, I will make a statement on all of these matters and it is not appropriate for me to say this morning, before I make my statement to Parliament, what it is I’m going to do.”</p>
      <p>Asked if the use of special measures is an option, Freeman replied: “It’s always an option. It’s something that we’ve done before in other cases, so of course it’s an option to look at how we escalate any board.</p>

      <p>“By escalation, that means that the Government takes a more interventionist role.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of her committee appearance, convener Lewis Macdonald said colleagues have “deep concerns” about the hospital.</p>
      <p>He said: “The issues at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and Edinburgh’s new Sick Kids Hospital are of deep concern to our committee."</p>
