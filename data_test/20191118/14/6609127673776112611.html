        <b>LIAM Gallagher appeared to rule out a potential Oasis reunion, hitting back at his brother Noel for his comments about Scotland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He blasted his older sibling, calling him a "moron" three times in response to Noel using the same insult to describe him.</p>

      <p>The High Flying Bird's frontman had previously said his younger brother's tweets were a 'nail in the coffin' of any Oasis reunion, but Liam has rubbished the claim.</p>
      <p>And it seems like the Gallaghers' feud will continue to rumble on after Liam slated his "big head" brother.</p>
      <p>Noel used an interview with The Big Issue to call out his former bandmate over rumours of a reunion.</p>

      <p>Referring to alleged abuse from Liam to his wife, he said: "If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you've said you are f***ing more of a moron than you look."</p>
      <p>But the former Beady Eye singer hit back on social media today, turning his brother's insult back on him.</p>
      <p>Liam called Noel out on his comments about Scotland, as well as his abuse of Britpop rivals Damom Albarn and Alex Cox of Blur in 1995.</p>

      <p>He tweeted: "Moron = The person who wishes aids on other people.</p>
      <p>"Moron = The person who says Scotland is a 3rd world country.</p>
      <p>"Moron = The little 1 in Oasis with the big head and naff dress sense.</p>
      <p>"As you were. LG x"</p>
      <p>He then went on to rubbish talk that he was stopping Oasis getting back together.</p>
      <p>One fan commented: "You are potentially ruining a reunion matey."</p>
      <p>But Liam said his brother wasn't really interested, replying: "Behave. He's not up for it. He's trying reverse psychology."</p>
      <p>During a gig in Aberdeen last week, he apologised for Noel's comments about Scotland.</p>
      <p>He told the crowd: “I’m gonna take this opportunity to apologise for my brother's words that he said about your country, there’s always one in the f***ing family”.</p>
      <p>The next night, in Glasgow, he repeated his apology before <a href="http://bit.ly/37j3Wnd">professing his love for Scotland</a> - adding he <a href="http://bit.ly/37j3Wnd">might even buy a house here.</a></p>
      <p>During his <a href="http://bit.ly/37j3Wnd">electric Hydro set</a> he told the raucous crowd: “It’s good to be back in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“It reminds me when I get famous I need to buy a little gaff up here. Oh no I’ll buy a big one instead.”</p>
