        <b>A splinter of the Liberal Democratic Party or LDP has formed a new committee, leaving out Oli Ahmad, a retired colonel.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party’s Joint Secretary General Shahadat Hossain Selim announced a new seven-member coordination committee, led by Abdul Karim Abbasi, from a news conference in Dhaka on Monday.</p>
      <p>On Oct 9, LDP President Oli formed a 203-member central committee. Abbasi and Selim were dropped from the committee, making them unhappy.</p>

      <p>“It’s impossible to work with Colonel Oli in politics. That’s why, we formed a new committee,” said Selim.</p>
      <p>“We’ll take the future course of action by speaking to the coordination committee.”</p>
      <p>In 2006, LDP was founded with AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury as president and Oli Ahmed executive president, bringing an end to Bikalpadhara Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>In 2007, Oli unveiled a new committee of the LDP to split the party into two, a month after Badruddoza announced a new 11-member presidium, expelling Oli and former speaker Shaikh Razzak Ali.</p>
