      <p>The Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit have uncovered a lion in the home of an Indian in the state, The PUNCH is reporting.</p>
      <p>According to the newspaper, the operatives of the Task Force have been deployed to guard the house for the evacuation of the lion.</p>
      <p>The operatives were deployed on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Head of the task force, Yinka Egbeyemi, told the newspaper: “The lion was found on No. 229 Muri Okunola Street.</p>
      <p>“Our Black Maria and men have been there since Friday.</p>
      <p>“They will remove the animal on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The Indian man rented the apartment and lied to the owner of the house that he wanted to be staying there.</p>
      <p>“He claimed that the house was under renovation and brought the animal there.</p>
      <p>“The neighbours saw the thing and that was how we got a petition from them.</p>
      <p>“We have sent him a letter that he should come and talk to us.</p>
      <p>“So, by tomorrow (Monday), we will like to know how he got the animal.</p>
      <p>“He will have to tell us why he is rearing a lion in a city; that is a wild animal and anything can happen.</p>
      <p>“So, he may be prosecuted.”</p>
