      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): WZ Satu Bhd is planning to raise up to RM72.3 million from a renounceable rights issue of irredeemable convertible preference shares (ICPS) that comes with free detachable warrants.</p>
      <p>The ICPS will be issued to shareholders at an entitlement date to be fixed on the basis of three ICPS for every four shares held and one free detachable warrant (Warrant B) for every four ICPS subscribed for, the company said in a stock exchange filing today.</p>
      <p>WZ Satu plans to amend the company's constitution to facilitate the issuance of the ICPS.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the issue price of the ICPS as well as the warrants' exercise price will be determined later. As much as RM72.3 million is expected to be raised, based on an illustrative issue price of 15 sen per ICPS, if up to 482.3 million ICPS are issued.</p>
      <p>Of the proceeds to be raised, up to RM71 million will be used to fund future construction and/or project financing activities, while the remainder will be used for working capital and to defray estimated expenses in relation to the proposals, WZ Satu said.</p>
      <p>Barring any unforeseen circumstances and subject to relevant approvals being obtained, the proposals are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>WZ Satuâ€™s shares closed half a sen or 1.92% higher at 26.5 sen today, valuing the company at RM135.59 million.</p>
