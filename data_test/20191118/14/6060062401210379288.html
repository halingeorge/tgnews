      <p>Donald Trump says he will "strongly consider" submitting evidence to the impeachment inquiry, after a string of witnesses denounced him in public testimony.</p>
      <p>Trump tweeted on Monday that he is leaning towards engaging with the impeachment process via submitting evidence in writing.</p>
      <p>The decision appeared to be prompted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggesting it on TV the previous day.</p>
      <p>Trump wrote: "Even though I did nothing wrong, and don't like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!"</p>

      <p>Trump's apparent newfound willingness to engage with the impeachment process followed testimony from its first public witnesses last week, which was widely deemed to further damage his defense from allegations of abusing the presidency in pushing for investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden by Ukraine.</p>
