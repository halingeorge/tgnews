      <h1>Crystals and meditation: The hottest holistic trends for 2020</h1>

      <p>2019 has been the year of wellness. We now realise that health is so much more than simply going to the gym a few times every week – we take a much more holistic approach.</p>
      <p>That means looking at our health in terms of the whole package; from our physical fitness, to our diet, stress levels and state of mind.</p>
      <p>So what are going to be the big holistic trends next year? Will we still be obsessed with all things mindfulness? What about our love-affair with meditation?</p>
      <p>We asked the specialist Claire Taylor from at health advisory brand <a href="https://civilizedhealth.com/">Civilized Health</a> to reveal what the popular wellness activities are likely to be in 2020.</p>
      <h3>Crystal healing </h3>
      <p>Celebrities such as Adele, Katy Perry, Victoria Beckham and Miranda Kerr have all spoken of their love of crystal healing.</p>
      <p>Their rise in popularity is confirmed as the term ‘crystal healing’ has seen a 263 per cent uplift in worldwide Google searches within the last year.</p>

      <p>The popularity of crystals is soaring. People who work with crystals believe that the stones hold a line of frequency that emit vibrations. Working with specific crystals will see that your body realigns in order to match the vibrations of the crystal.</p>
      <p>Working with crystals that match your personal goals (for instance career, love or wealth) will intensify your intention and ensure that your intention evolves into a reality.</p>
      <p>If crystal healing is something that you would like to adopt into your everyday routine, I recommend carving out some time in order to establish what your goals are in each area of your life.</p>
      <p>Then, commit to researching which crystals align with your intentions for instance, Rose Quartz can encourage peace and healing whereas Citrine emits wealth and prosperity.</p>
      <p>Carry the crystal along with your intention and use it as a tool to focus and realign your energy.</p>
      <p>I predict that 2020 will also see a rise in people working with the earth’s moon cycles and aligning their crystal work with these phases.</p>
      <h3>Acupressure mats </h3>

      <p>I am, personally, a huge advocate for acupressure mats and general interest in the product is growing.</p>
      <p>‘Acupressure mat UK’ has received a 294 per cent rise in Google searches in the last year alone.</p>
      <p>The acupressure mat is essentially a sheet that holds tiny plastic ‘spikes’ that replicate the needles used within the practice of acupuncture.</p>
      <p>The mats can erase tension and ignite a deep sense of relaxation. They are especially popular with those who experience aches and pains in their back and the ever-growing situation of tech neck.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Laying on the mat for a short time can provide the same remedies as acupuncture, without the use of needles. I strongly recommend wearing clothing when using the mat for the first few times as it can be painful.</p>
      <p>Initially, lay on the mat for a total of five minutes at a time. Once this becomes less painful, increase the time spent on the mat until you reach a maximum of 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>Do not be afraid to use the mat multiple times throughout the day instead of in one block.</p>
      <h3>Meditation </h3>

      <p>The past year has seen an undeniable rise in mindfulness and breathing apps alike.</p>
      <p>Many of us live in a fast-paced environment where we are striving for success in our perspective fields whist attempting to achieve the somewhat allusive work life balance. It is therefore no surprise that ‘meditation’ has seen a 136 per cent rise in Google searches.</p>
      <p>Many believe that practicing meditation means that you have to dedicate endless hours to sitting in a room in silence. This couldn’t be further from the truth. The beauty of meditation is that it can be practiced anytime, anywhere.</p>
      <p>Meditation reduces cortisol levels in the brain, which lowers stress levels and anxiety. Migraine sufferers also report that meditation eases and, in some instances, prevents symptoms.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Meditation requires participants to focus on breathing and focus. The mind is likely to wander. Instead of aiming to prevent this, notice where your thoughts go and retrieve focus back to your centre.</p>
      <p>With practice, your mind will wander less and less.</p>
      <p>We are often so focused on getting through the day that we rarely stop in order to reflect on how we feel. Practicing meditation in short spurts throughout the day presents the opportunity to asses how you feel and disperse of negative energy and improve concentration.</p>
