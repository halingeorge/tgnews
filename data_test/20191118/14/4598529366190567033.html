      <p>President Trump offered a surprising response on Monday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) suggestion that he testify before the House committees probing impeachment — he’ll consider it.</p>
      <p>In a tweet thread Monday morning, Trump insulted Pelosi and CBS’ “Face the Nation” — calling the Sunday show “DEFACE THE NATION” — before suggesting he might be open to providing written testimony to congressional investigators.</p>
      <p>“I like the idea and will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” he tweeted</p>
