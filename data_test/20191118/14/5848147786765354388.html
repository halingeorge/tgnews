      <h1>Woman‘s Uber Eats sacking ‘dystopian’: TWU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:33:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/steven-trask/" target="_blank">Steven Trask</a></address>
      <p>The case of an Uber Eats driver who was allegedly sacked for delivering food 10 minutes late has been likened to modern-day slavery.</p>
      <p>The Transport Workers Union on Monday launched an appeal against a previous Fair Work Commission decision that upheld the sacking of Adelaide-based driver Amita Gupta.</p>
      <p>Ms Gupta delivered food for Uber Eats for as many as 96 hours per week, according to the TWU.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/09/17/ubereats-fair-work-court-case/">She was stood down in January without the right to appeal</a> after receiving a message that her access to the Uber app had been stopped.</p>
      <p>The Commission previously rejected Ms Gupta’s unfair dismissal claim, saying she was not an actual employee of Uber Eats.</p>
      <p>This means she was not protected by unfair dismissal laws.</p>
      <p>The union’s appeal on behalf of Ms Gupta was about ending “worker exploitation via an app”.</p>
      <p>“We do not believe it is in the public interest for these dystopian conditions to be allowed to endure and become the norm in Australia,” TWU National Secretary Michael Kaine said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The union is seeking to establish rights for gig-economy workers after previous legal fights with Deliveroo and Foodora.</p>
