      <h1>DWP denies man who died at Job Centre was deemed fit to work recently</h1>
      <h2>A 65-year-old died in the Job Centre in Llanelli</h2>

      <p>The DWP says a man who died at the Job Centre in Llanelli had not been declared fit to work recently.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old, who has not been identified, was waiting for an appointment in Llanelli but passed away on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Job Centre staff and customers rushed to assist him. When they were unable to get a response, they placed him on the floor and began attempting to resuscitate him. An ambulance was called but he was sadly declared dead at the scene by paramedics.</p>
      <p>It is being widely reported that the man died after being declared fit to work.</p>
      <p>Websites are running quotes from an unnamed witness saying: "I didn't know him myself, but the man who was sat next to me told me that he had grown up with the guy. The man next to me told me that the poorly guy had diabetes and had been declared fit for work by the Job Centre earlier in the year, but he was obviously ill. The ambulance came, but he sadly died, and they had to take his body out of the Job Centre. It was awful."</p>
      <p>But a DWP source said reports the man had been declared fit to work were inaccurate and that he had been attending routine appointments for more than a year.</p>
      <p>A Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust spokesman said: "We were called on Friday November 15 at approximately 9.33am to reports of a person needing urgent medical attention on Stepney Street in central Llanelli.</p>
      <p>"We responded with one rapid response vehicle, one specialised medical vehicle and one emergency ambulance."</p>
      <p>A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "Our thoughts and those of the staff at Llanelli Job Centre are with the family and friends at the time."</p>
