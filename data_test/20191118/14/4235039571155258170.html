      <p><b>Greenland</b>'s largest <b>airport</b> will be <b>closed</b> due to climate change. The <b>airport</b> north of the capital Nuuk serves 11,000 aircraft annually and serves as a base for travel across the vast island.</p>
      <p>The reason for the closure is the melting of the permafrost. The ever-frozen ground on which the <b>airport</b> was built began to melt from the higher temperatures. This causes cracks.</p>
      <p>According to the management of the <b>airport</b>, their activity will be impossible for up to 5 years. <b>Greenland</b> will be forced to build a new <b>airport</b>, relying on assistance from the Danish Air Force to complete the project.</p>
      <p>"They are constructing a new <b>airport</b> in Nuuk and in the north .... and the Danish Airforce will take over responsibility for this <b>airport</b>," said <b>airport</b> manager Peter HÃ¸gh told Euronews.</p>
