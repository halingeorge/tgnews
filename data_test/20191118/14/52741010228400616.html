      <p>TORONTO — Education Minister Stephen Lecce is calling on Ontario's major teachers' unions to enter into mediation as most take steps toward strike action.</p>
      <p>He says disagreements remain at the table on key issues, including compensation, and having an independent, third party would help reach deals.</p>
      <p>Lecce is speaking on the issue just as Ontario's Catholic teachers say they have filed for conciliation in their negotiations with the province.</p>
      <p>The Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association says the province is insisting on drastic cuts, and has demonstrated what the union calls a total lack of understanding or respect for the bargaining process.</p>
      <p>Catholic teachers voted 97 per cent in favour of a strike if necessary.</p>
      <p>The union representing Ontario's high school teachers will be releasing the results of their strike votes today.</p>
      <p>A media advisory also says the president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation will be talking about the union's "next steps."</p>
      <p>OSSTF is already in a legal strike position as of today, though it's also required to give five days notice before a strike and has not yet done so.</p>
      <p>Three of Ontario's four major teachers' unions are taking steps toward potential strikes as they negotiate with the government for new contracts.</p>
      <p>Elementary teachers are set to start a work-to-rule campaign on Nov. 26 that they say will target ministry and school board administrative tasks and will not affect student learning.</p>
      <p>Negotiations between the province and French teachers continue.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 18, 2019.</p>
