      <h1>Mitch Trubisky’s disastrous season got sadder on Sunday night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:45:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author">Post Wire Report</a></address>
      <p>After 58 mostly dispiriting minutes for the Bears offense, Mitch Trubisky was sent to the bench.</p>
      <p>NBC’s coverage included coach Matt Nagy huddling tightly with the Bears’ beleaguered third-year quarterback. seemingly explaining his decision to sit him in what would be a 17-7 loss to the Rams. Nagy and Trubisky would say afterwards that it was a hip injury, suffered at the end of the first half, that forced the Bears to turn to Chase Daniel for the final fruitless drive of the game.</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘Listen, here’s the deal. We got to know, and you got to be honest with us as to where you’re at.’ And it was hard for him to say that. It was really hard, but he told me exactly how he felt, and I made the decision to put Chase in there at that time,” Nagy said.</p>
      <p>Trubisky was 24 of 43 passing for 190 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He was 7 of 9 for 66 yards on the Bears’ touchdown drive in the third quarter, which ended with a back shoulder 14-yard scoring throw to Tarik Cohen.</p>
      <p>Another quarterback, another team this could easily get shrugged off as a simple decision because of injury. Instead, Trubisky’s injury represents another blow in what is quickly becoming a lost season for the Bears, who dropped to 4-6 less than a year removed from a 12-4 campaign and NFC North division title.</p>
      <p>It is a reminder that Trubisky’s time as Chicago’s starter is  nearing an end — complete with a sad meme now to go with it.</p>

      <p>“You just want to be out there with your team,” Trubisky said. “But if you’re not 100 percent, you can’t help the team. I’m not doing the team any favors if I’m not able to run around or throw the ball with accuracy because I’m throwing with all arm. Just you got to be smart from that factor, but I’m going to fight as long as I can to try to be out there with my guys.”</p>
      <p>The uncertainty about the situation was evident from Trubisky’s teammates, with wide receiver Anthony Miller saying he pulled Trubisky aside and told him to stay positive, even if he wasn’t entirely clear about the situation.</p>
      <p>And if the injury were to force Trubisky out of the starting lineup, Miller said that is out of his control.</p>
      <p>“I just have to do my job,” Miller said. “Really, I can’t do anything about that. I’m not the GM. I’m not the head coach, so I don’t gotta ask about that.”</p>
