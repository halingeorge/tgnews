      <h1>Investment in metering will reveal electrification rates in Africa</h1>

        <b>Research estimates that there are 600 million people across Africa who still lack access to electricity, creating enormous room for investment growth in sub-Saharan Africa’s power sector over the next decade.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The majority of this investment will be directed towards generation, but billions of dollars of investment in the transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) and metering segments will be just as crucial.</p>
      <p>In total, $141 billion will be invested in sub-Saharan Africa’s power sector between 2019–2028, according to a new study published today by Northeast Group.</p>
      <p>Economic development in sub-Saharan Africa is inextricably tied to the growth of its power sector, and the international community has played a major role in sector growth.</p>
      <p>All segments of the power sector require massive investment, with generation capacity that regularly falls short of demand, aging T&amp;D infrastructure, and millions of unmetered existing customers, in addition to the many millions more without any access to electricity.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Increasingly, smart infrastructure will play a role in this investment, helping to develop microgrids and mini-grids, modernise T&amp;D grids, and improve revenue collection through advanced metering infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“Electrification efforts in Africa understandably typically focus on adding generation but that’s far from the whole story,” according to Steve Chakerian, senior research analyst at Northeast Group.</p>
      <p>Chakerian adds: “Generation will see huge growth, but billions of dollars will still need to be spent to build out T&amp;D grids. In addition, electricity meters are the ‘cash registers’ of the power sector. Without efficient metering, African utilities will not have the necessary funds to invest sufficiently in their grids.”</p>

      <p>China has been leading investment throughout Africa and that is also the case in the power sector. In particular, the recent growth of low-cost Chinese-made AMI meters has opened up the market to smart metering, helping improve utilities’ capacity to reduce non-technical losses.</p>
      <p>There are now notable AMI projects in Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, among others.</p>
      <p>But there is still room for other international vendors active in the region – frequently in partnership with local manufacturers.</p>
      <p>Investment in metering will be critical to enabling further crucial investment in T&amp;D infrastructure and generation.</p>
