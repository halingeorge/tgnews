        <b>The AFL and the GAA have today confirmed that the International Rules Series will return in 2020 and 2022.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ireland will play host to a two-test series next year before Australia return the favour two years later. The <a href="https://punditarena.com/gaa/thepateam/watch-these-top-5-international-rules-hits-will-get-you-fired-up-for-sunday/">compromised rules series</a>, which first took place in 1984, will make a return following a three-year hiatus.</p>
      <p>The last instalment in the long-running rivalry took place in 2017 when Australia won back Cormac McAnallen Cup for the first time since 2013 after defeating Ireland in two tests at Adelaide and Perth.</p>

      <p>GAA Director General Tom Ryan said: “We are pleased to announce the return of the International Rules Series in 2020 and look forward to re-connecting with our friends and colleagues in the AFL, both on and off the field.</p>
      <p>“The series offers our players the chance to wear the green jersey and represent Ireland and it also provides them with an opportunity to pit themselves against the best from another code while showcasing the best skills of Gaelic football.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AFL">AFL</a> General Manager Football Operations Steve Hocking said players named in the 2020 Virgin Australia All-Australian team will be the first qualify.</p>
      <p>“We want to take the best of the best to the two-test series in Ireland next year and our All-Australian players will be the first players selected,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We saw in 2017 two high standard matches that drew great attendances. I look forward to the rivalry continuing when the test series returns next year.”</p>
