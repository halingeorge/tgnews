      <h1>Pokémon Sword is the UK’s best selling exclusive of the year</h1>

        <b>Following its launch on the 15th, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-introduces-galarian-forms-team-yell-pokejobs-and-new-rivals/">Pokémon Sword</a> is currently enjoying being both the best selling game of the week in the UK and the best selling exclusive game of the year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pokémon Sword’s sibling game Pokémon Shield is currently sitting at number 3 on the UK charts, with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (which also released on November 15th) stopping the two games from claiming the top spot.</p>
      <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield are also available in a Dual Edition pack, which is currently sitting at number 7 on the charts, thus beating out the recently released Death Stranding, which in turn has moved down to number 8.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-17-uk-charts-pok-mon-sword-and-shield-post-huge-opening-weekend-sales">According to gamesindustry.biz</a>, both Sword and Shield have managed to secure the second biggest launch for Pokémon games in UK history.</p>

      <p>The duo (including the Dual Edition of the two games) have managed to shift 43% more physical units than 2010’s Black and White on Nintendo DS and 64.6% more units than 2018’s Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu and Let’s Go Eevee.</p>
      <p>However, despite Sword and Shield’s obvious success, they haven’t managed to sell as many units as Pokémon Sun and Moon did, with the latter holding onto its title as the biggest Nintendo launch in the UK ever.</p>
      <p>Pokémon Sword is also currently the third biggest boxed game launch of 2019, following FIFA 20 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. It’s worth nothing that both FIFA 20 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare are multi-platform games, while Sword is a Nintendo Switch exclusive, making this feat all the more impressive.</p>
