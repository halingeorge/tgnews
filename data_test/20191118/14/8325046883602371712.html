      <ul>
        <li>I spend a good portion of my free time out in the elements. From fishing and hunting to camping and cooking, my skin, and especially my hands, take a thrashing.</li>
        <li>I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008J5YA9K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biip_101619_sallyander-rescue-me-balm-review-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B008J5YA9K&amp;amp;linkId=4efd3550d9848ff6ed28176c188ff2ca">SallyeAnder Rescue Me balm ($19.99)</a> for anything shy of wounds that require hospital visits (which are every bit as frequent as you might expect), and I’ve yet to witness it not work wonders on my skin.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s loaded with natural ingredients like soy, cocoa, and olive oil, as well as wheat germ, and essential oils from rosemary, spearmint, eucalyptus, tea tree, and more.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Day in and day out, I put my hands through hell and back. Chopping wood, building fires, and hunting leviathans. Just kidding, my workweek is spent just like you, chained to a desk just like yours. But on the weekends, I do manage to live out my Hemmingway- and London-esque fantasies of wrangling sea creatures and building fires, and come Monday my hands are always a little worse for wear.</p>
      <p>That’s why I keep SallyeAnder’s Rescue Me intensive care balm on my office desk, which I use to heal everything from chapped lips to dry hands, as well as all kinds of burns, scrapes, sores, and more. It’s my be-all, end-all, cure-all for all the wraths my body incurs over the course of a weekend aquatic.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <p>There’s a long list of ingredients, but this stuff is, by and large, hypoallergenic. Though not listed on Amazon, the ingredients are right on the tin, in order as follows: soy, cocoa, olive, shea, and castor oils, beeswax, rosehip, Centella Asiatica, wheat germ, frankincense, Canadian balsam, cistus absolute, rosemary, spearmint, rose geranium, eucalyptus, white camphor, thyme, tea tree, vetiver, clove, and benjamin essential oils.</p>
      <p>Effectively, what you get is an anti-inflammatory (frankincense, eucalyptus, thyme), anti-fungal (clove, geranium, eucalyptus), anti-bacterial (tea tree, geranium, eucalyptus) salve that works on everything from arthritis and scrapes to eczema and cold sores.</p>
      <h3>What it’s like to use</h3>

      <p>What hits on the nose most is probably a combination of the clove, spearmint, and cocoa. What I like about it is that, while there is spearmint in it, it’s as effective but not as effusive as something like Tiger Balm, which makes my eyes well up each and every time I put it on. It also smells like my grandmother (whom I loved, but <i>good grief</i>).</p>
      <p>I use this stuff on everything, though, and it is just like Tiger Balm without the smell or the tingly menthol sensation. As temperatures drop and arthritic dampness grips me, my joints, and my soul, this stuff takes the edge off without making me feel like my body’s on fire. Okay, that’s enough ragging on Tiger Balm. You get it.</p>
      <p>Let’s just say that after a weekend spent fishing and hunting, my hands, lips, and sundry scrapes and burns are healed up just in time to go do it all over again on Friday night.</p>
      <h3>The bottom line</h3>
      <p>Sure, you could go buy all of these essential oils (or even some of them) and get basically the same thing, but will you? Further, it’s only about 20 bucks for two ounces; what’s your time worth? A tin of this stuff is a very handy thing to have around, especially during the winter months.</p>
      <p><b>Pros: </b>Not as intense on the nose as Tiger Balm, but just as (if not more) effective</p>
      <p><b>Cons: </b>None to speak of, other than maybe the price</p>
