      <h1>Mystery 'deadly' outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting in dogs sweeping parts of UK</h1>
      <h2>Dog Roker in Bradbury, near Sedgefield, had an 18-day ordeal as he battled back to health after being hit with a severe sickness bug</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:33:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, Mike Brown, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>An unexplained and potentially deadly outbreak of a diarrhoea and vomiting bug among dogs has been reported by a renowned animal hospital.</p>
      <p>Experts are now warning dog owners to be on their guard and take no chances if their pet is hit by a prolonged bout of diarrhoea and sickness, especially if it is "bloody and persistent".</p>
      <p>Staff Wear Referrals in Bradbury, near Sedgefield have treated a spate of stricken dogs in recent weeks – including the near fatal case of one-year-old miniature schnauzer, Roker, <a href="https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/">Teeside Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Specialists Nicki Redd said: "When Roker arrived with us, he was already in shock as a result of hypovolaemia and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541">sepsis</a> . He was dehydrated and was breathing heavily.</p>
      <p>"An ultrasound scan of his abdomen showed the bowel wall was severely ulcerated and in places it was only 0.6mm thick. In addition, gas had travelled from the bowel to the lymph nodes and liver.</p>

      <p>"Roker received a plasma transfusion, along with intravenous antibiotics and analgesia, as well a fluid resuscitation and supportive medication for ulceration and nausea.</p>
      <p>"Within 48 hours he was eating again. A second scan documented his bowel wall was recovering and he was finally discharged from the hospital four days after admission.</p>
      <p>"He is continuing to improve and is nearly back to normal but he could very easily have died from this condition, as he was at high risk of bowel perforation."</p>
      <p>Roker’s relieved owners, Gareth and Joanne Devine, from Hurworth , have revealed how they suffered a horrendous 18-day ordeal as their beloved pet struggled to survive.</p>
      <p>Gareth said: "At the start, no-one realised the severity of Roker’s condition. He was seen by four different vets from two different practices, six visits over a period of 11 days, before we were referred to Wear and discovered how much danger he was in.</p>
      <p>"We were so shocked that we could lose Roker to something so common-place and seemingly benign as sickness and diarrhoea but he’d become so poorly we were prepared for the worst.</p>

      <p>"That’s why we want to warn other dog owners to be aware of this very serious outbreak in the area. We don’t want anyone to go through the awful roller coaster experience that we did – or worse."</p>
      <p>Joanne added: “The worst time of all was when he was in intensive care at Wear Referrals. I was in tears and I couldn’t speak to anyone because I was so upset.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have children, so Roker is really special to us and the thought he might die so young was terrible."</p>
      <p>Wear’s Hospital Manager Darren Stubbs says the cause of the outbreak remains a mystery, which is a further reason for vigilance.</p>
      <p>He said: "It’s worth saying that a number of these cases had been treated for vomiting and/or diarrhoea prior to referral to us.</p>
      <p>"They’d appeared to show an initial improvement at first, but then rapidly deteriorated.</p>
      <p>"This may mean there’s a novel viral agent, such as the vesivirus, which was identified in an outbreak in Virginia in 2015, or a toxic agent such as mushrooms which have been suggested to be involved in a recent outbreak of acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea in Norway."</p>
