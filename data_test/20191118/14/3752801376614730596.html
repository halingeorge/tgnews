      <p>Hundreds of residents of Mpolweni, outside Pietermaritzburg, are struggling to put their lives back together in the aftermath of last week's tornado, <a href="https://www.groundup.org.za/article/hundreds-left-homeless-pietermartizburg-tornado-struggle-pick-their-lives/">GroundUp reports</a>.</p>
      <p>More than 200 homes were destroyed or damaged in the tornado, leaving hundreds of residents roofless in Thokozani, Lindokuhle Village and Mvundlo.</p>
      <p>Two people lost their lives — a man in Mpolweni and a woman in Thokoza — and at least 18 were injured, according to uMshwathi Local Municipality manager Nhlanhla Mabaso.</p>
      <p>He said various companies and humanitarian organisations were helping.</p>
      <p>"Our officials are on the alert since the weather has not cleared up," he said on Friday.</p>
      <p>In Lindokuhle Village, the mud house of Velephi Mncube, 67, and her 77-year-old wheelchair-bound husband collapsed on them.</p>
      <p>"The clouds became dark … The house started moving. I remember screaming and telling my husband to watch out … There was heavy wind and rain. Something out of nowhere hit me in the face. The house fell on us. My husband was under pieces of the wall," said Mncube.</p>

      <p>"I shouted for help. A neighbour came to rescue us. There was a lot of blood coming from the wound on my face. I don’t know what hit me. I suspect it was the corrugated iron that was flying. I had a big cut on my face. They had to take me to hospital immediately," said Mncube.</p>
      <p>In Mpolweni, residents were trying to rebuild their homes. Some were searching the veld for corrugated sheeting.</p>
      <p>The municipality has provided tents, but people need blankets, said Lindiwe Hlophe. She and her husband sleep in a car.</p>
      <p>"Our children use the tent … We share blankets with neighbours …We have no food. There are no toilets … We have no choice … We lost everything."</p>
      <p>Some residents have found refuge at a church, which was also damaged in the storm. Businesses are assisting with food at the church, but not all residents can access it.</p>
      <p>"If they can have a way to reach the homes of the elderly who have difficulty walking to the church … We are hungry and homeless," said Nelisiwe Shange.</p>
