      <h1>T-Mobile COO Mike Sievert to Take Over as CEO May 1</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:45:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere <a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Mike-Sievert-to-Succeed-John-Legere-as-CEO-of-T-Mobile-on-May-1-2020/default.aspx">will step down</a> from his position on May 1, 2020 and COO Mike Sievert will take his place. Mr. Legere will remain a board member.</p>
      <h3>Leadership Transition</h3>
      <p>Currently Mike Sievert runs marketing and product groups for T-Mobile, as well as retail, sales, and customer support groups. He was also at Mr. Legere’s side during the merger plans for T-Mobile and Sprint. John Legere:</p>
      <blockquote>Mike is well prepared to lead T-Mobile into the future. He has a deep understanding of where T-Mobile has been and where it needs to go to remain the most innovative company in the industry. I am extremely proud of the culture and enthusiasm we have built around challenging the status quo and our ongoing commitment to putting customers first. Together, these attributes have distinguished T-Mobile in the marketplace and on Wall Street, giving us a powerful business advantage that is instilled throughout every level of T-Mobile. I am confident it will thrive under Mike’s leadership.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier this months there were rumors that Mr. Legere would take over as CEO of WeWork, but <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/john-legere-isnt-leaving-t-mobile-to-take-wework-ceo-job.html">it sounds like</a> that won’t happen.</p>
