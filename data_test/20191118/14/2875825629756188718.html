      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chloe-ferry">Chloe Ferry</a> 's ex-boyfriends <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/sam-gowland">Sam Gowland</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/marty-mckenna">Marty McKenna</a> were involved in a violent brawl on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/geordie-shore">Geordie Shore</a> stars are set to go head-to-head in a celebrity MMA event at the Utilita Arena on December 14 and attended a press conference over the weekend ahead of their ringside debut.</p>
      <p>There is clearly some bad blood between the two reality stars as things quickly got heated with security forced to step in and separate them after they hurled chairs at each other.</p>
      <p>The press conference at Northumbria University Students Union saw Sam, 24, and Marty, 25, threaten each other, shout harsh insults and throw drinks, chairs and attempted punches towards each other.</p>

      <p>As the pair went face to face, Sam shoved Marty as a host frantically screamed "get security".</p>
      <p>Footage taken from the audience at the event showed the pair getting riled up when asked about their former flame Chloe Ferry.</p>
      <p>But Marty told the press conference: "I just want to get it across that it's not about Chloe. It couldn't be further from Chloe.</p>
      <p>"The opportunity arose to me. I was getting 20 grand for this straightener. Why wouldn't I take it?"</p>
      <p>Host Charlie Sloth said: "It feels like there's some tension around that situation though."</p>
      <p>Marty replied: "We're going for a fight with each other, in a cage, we're not going to be nice to each other."</p>

      <p>He previously snarled: " At the end of the day we're going in there to f****** destroy each other."</p>
      <p>The Ex On The Beach star hinted at their ongoing feud as he sarcastically teased: "This is a fight I’ve been wanting to have for a long time."</p>
      <p>While Sam recently suggested his hatred towards Marty, saying: "This is a fight we’ve both wanted and I can’t wait to knock him out in front of his friends in his home town."</p>

      <p>Marty had an on/off romance with Chloe until he was suspended from the show, while Chloe and Sam were in a relationship from October 2017.</p>
      <p>Chloe and Sam first split in May this year when she accused him of cheating on her with Love Island star Amber Davies.</p>
      <p>The pair briefly reunited but have since split, seemingly for good.</p>

      <p>Sam and Marty first declared their plans to fight, after the Love Island star said he would punch Marty if he ever decided to return to Geordie Shore.</p>
      <p>Last year, Marty posted a cosy snap of him and former love interest Chloe sparking an angry response despite claiming it was an April Fool’s joke.</p>
      <p>Sam blasted Marty saying it was his attempt at getting back in the limelight.</p>
      <p>Sam and Marty exchanged furious words on social media with Chloe's boyfriend-at-the-time challenging her ex to a charity boxing match.</p>

      <p>Chloe is clearly over both her exes and regularly takes to social media to flaunt her impossible curves in scantily clad outfits.</p>
      <p>The blonde bombshell hit the town in a black lace bodysuit and clown make up last week, and that wasn't her only eyebrow-raising outfit.</p>
      <p>She posted photos to her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> in nothing but a pink bodysuit, white thigh high boots and a butterfly wings cape.</p>
      <p>Chloe seemed excited for her big night, writing the caption "I’m back b****es!!!!" while celebrating wrapping the latest series of Geordie Shore.</p>

        <b>The MMA night will be headlined by Scotty T and Stephen Bear at the Utilita Arena in Newcastle, on December 14.</b>
