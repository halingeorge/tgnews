      <h1>Michael Schumacher film with never-before-seen footage of F1 legend's life 'postponed'</h1>
      <h2>Very little information about Michael Schumacher has been released since his skiing accident in December 2013 - with the new film set to show unreleased footage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T14:36:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>A feature film which was due to celebrate the life of F1 legend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/michael-schumacher-ski-accident-10360005">Michael Schumacher</a> has been postponed.</p>
      <p>The movie was announced in May and will tell the story of Schumacher, from his time as a talented go-karter in Germany all the way through to his devastating ski-accident.</p>
      <p>His wife Corrina has given her full backing to the film, along with the couple's children Gina and Mick.</p>
      <p>But B14 Film, who are creating the movie, have put back the release date - which will include never before seen footage.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for production company B14 Film said: “Due to the very extensive material the directors and the production want to spend even more time to complete the film.”</p>

      <p>Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm had previously announced the film and explained what would be included.</p>
      <p>She said: “The highlights of his Formula One career, his athletic highs and lows, will be as much a part of the story as previously unseen archive footage.</p>
      <p>“It sheds light on the uncompromising driver, ambitious young man, pragmatic mechanic and confident team player as well as the family man.”</p>

      <p>Schumacher has been guarded from the public gaze since the ski-accident in December 2013 which left him in a coma and with a serious brain injury - with very little information released.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Willi Weber, his long-term manager, said he believed Corinna <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/michael-schumachers-ex-manager-claims-20865470">feared the truth about Schumacher’s condition entering the public domain.</a></p>
      <p>But now Corinna has hit back at Weber in a rare interview, saying 50-year-old Schumacher was "in the very best of hands".</p>
      <p>"He is in the best of hands right now and we are doing everything we can to help him," she said to <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-me/inspiration/she/">She's Mercedes</a> magazine.</p>
      <p>"Try to understand that we follow Michael's desire to keep his health a secret.</p>
      <p>"You can be sure that he is in the very best of hands and that we are doing everything humanly possible to help him.</p>
      <p>"Please understand if we are following Michael's wishes and keeping such a sensitive subject as health, as it has always been, in privacy."</p>
