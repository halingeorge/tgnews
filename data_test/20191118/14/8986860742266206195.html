      <p>Ghanaians on social media have described Efia Odo’s dress to the 2019 4Syte Music Video Awards as a silver shine and not a dress.</p>
      <p>According to critics of the controversial actress, Efia Odo should not for once assume she wore a cloth to the award show.</p>

      <p>Instead what she wore could be likened to a silver shine, the aluminum sponge which is used in the kitchen to remove tough stains in silver bowls.</p>
      <p>Efia Odo wore a see-through white lace which exposes her panties and tiny boobs to the world.</p>
      <p>Whiles Ghanaians have accused her of going to the show naked, Efia Odo has dropped two photos of nakked p0rn stars on her twitter handle to explain what nakkedness is.</p>
