      <p>“Forrest Gump”, a 1994 <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911061077236864-is-hollywood-ready-to-gush-over-another-exotic-bollywood-beauty/">American drama film</a> directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Eric Roth, is based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom.</p>

      <p>The story is about several decades in the life of Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining historical events in the 20th century United States.</p>
      <p>Aamir, whose last film “<a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201911151077316712-starry-affairs-five-times-when-bollywood-danced-the-night-away-with-hollywood-celebs/">Thugs of Hindostan</a>” failed at the box office, took to Instagram to share his first look from “Laal Singh Chaddha”. He wrote, " Sat Sri Akaal ji, myself Laal...Laal Singh Chaddha."</p>
