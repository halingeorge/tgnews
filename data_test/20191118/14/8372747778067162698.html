      <p>PUNTA GORDA, Fla. -- This week there will be a new place to shop while helping people in the community.</p>
      <p>A brand new Goodwill store and donation center will open in Punta Gorda on Thursday. This new location will offer an expanded retail space and has been customized for the community.</p>

      <p>A grand opening ribbon-cutting is planned for 8:45 a.m. Thursday.</p>
