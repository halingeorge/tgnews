      <p>The Diabetes Club of Tiruchi, in association with the Indian Medical Association, Tiruchi Branch, organised an awareness programme on diabetes on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The more the patient knows about diabetes, the easier it is for medical practitioners like us to treat them. Small changes, like a spot on the body, or slow loss of vision needs to be brought to the doctor's attention,” said V. Ravindranath, Vice Chairman, Diabetes Club of Tiruchi.</p>
      <p>“If there is one thing you take home from this experience, let it be that you must protect your feet. Cracks, spots, rashes, could all lead to bigger complications”, he added.</p>
      <p>Dr. Ramesh informed the attendees that pre-diabetes, where a patient has not been diagnosed with diabetes but could be on the road to it, is also a disease. “The pre-diabetic will have to take as much precaution and care as a diabetic, sometimes some more, to ensure that they do not have to suffer for the rest of their lives,” he said</p>
      <p>M. Senthilvel, presented a slideshow on ‘Physical Activities and Exercise for Diabetes’ and said that patients must include cardio training, such as aerobics, running, swimming and skipping besides resistance training which includes resistance provided by your body weight, gravity, bands, weighted bars or dumbbells. Childhood obesity, too, is a phenomenon to be cautious about, he said.</p>
      <p>Doctors conducted free diabetes, blood sugar tests and provided free consultation to patients.</p>
