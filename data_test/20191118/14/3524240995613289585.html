        <b>Sunday Aborisade, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>Worried by the spate of criticisms that have greeted the Hate Speech Bill which passed first reading last week, the Senate has distanced itself from the proposed legislation</p>
      <p>The acting spokesperson for the red chamber, Senator Godiya Akwashiki, told journalists in Abuja on Monday that contrary to widespread impression, the bill was not the idea of the ninth Senate</p>
      <p>He said it was solely being sponsored by the Deputy Chief Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, based on his conviction.</p>
      <p>Akwashiki described as unfortunate, the statement credited to the Peoples Democratic Party, which insinuated that the bill was a Senate bill, skewed to make the alleged third term ambition of President Muhammadu Buhari possible.</p>
      <p>He maintained that the fate of the bill would be determined on the floor of the Senate after a robust debate by senators.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the ex-spokesperson for the Senate who sponsored the bill insisted at a news briefing on Monday that his proposed legislation is aimed at achieving peace in the country.</p>
      <p>Details later.</p>
