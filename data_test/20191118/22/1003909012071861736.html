      <h1>U of C recommends exchange students leave Hong Kong</h1>

      <p>The University of Calgary is advising two exchange students in Hong Kong to leave the region amid social unrest and <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/world/hong-kong-campus-protesters-fire-arrows-as-unrest-spreads-across-kowloon">escalation of violence</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement, U of C vice-provost Susan Barker said the university has offered assistance to the students as they cope with the situation.</p>
      <p>“We have reached out to them and recommended that they both leave the country,” Barker stated. “Additionally, we have also offered to provide the students with assistance related to extra costs incurred as a result of their early departure from Hong Kong.”</p>
      <p>They are the only two U of C students currently enrolled in exchange programs in Hong Kong, according to the university.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Mount Royal University said that institution does not have any students on exchange in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Anti-government protests have been taking place in the Chinese-ruled city for about five months. Some school campuses have turned into fortresses under siege as clashes between police and protesters intensify.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, protesters shot bows and arrows and hurled petrol bombs from rooftops at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, as police fired tear gas and blue liquid from water cannons.</p>
      <p>The campus is one of five universities to remain occupied.</p>
      <p>The heads of nine universities in Hong Kong issued a joint statement last week saying “several universities were under protesters’ control” and that “the government response has so far not been effective.”</p>
      <p>Students from mainland China and Taiwan started to leave Hong Kong campuses mid-week when several universities suspended classes for the rest of the term.</p>
      <p>By late Thursday, schools in the U.S., Australia and the U.K. were either urging or requiring their students on exchange in Hong Kong to return home.</p>
      <p>The University of British Columbia <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/ubc-recommends-its-exchange-students-leave-hong-kong">also recommended on Friday</a> that its students on exchange in Hong Kong leave the area.</p>
