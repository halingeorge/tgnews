      <p>James asked Ian if he’d fulfilled everything he wanted to do.</p>

      <p>But Ian added: “I couldn’t believe I got left out of (Euro) 96, I cried for days. He (Glenn Hoddle) took Robbie Fowler and Les Ferdinand who are obviously top players, unbelievable players but I was devastated.”</p>
      <p>Talking in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-im-celebrity-out-here-17272345">the Bush Telegraph</a> after Ian's revelations, Caitlyn said: “Ian, James and myself all some from a sports background so for me, I’m always intrigued by people who have achieved so much in sport and I want to hear their story.”</p>
      <p>James told Ian how he got into rugby as a child but that initially he was more interested in football, athletics and tennis.</p>
      <p>Talking in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-im-celebrity-out-here-17272081">the Bush Telegraph</a> about himself, Ian and Caitlyn, James said: “I think everyone, especially the three of us appreciates what it took to get to the levels we did.  We have definitely got a common ground, it’s nice to share that and hear from two people I really admire.”</p>
