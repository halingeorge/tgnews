      <h1>Football Manager 2020 free agents: Best bargain players in FM20</h1>
      <h2>Signing world-class players is what Football Manager 2020 is all about, but what do you do if you haven't got any cash in the bank? Well, you snap up some free agents, of course</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:18:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:18</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>So you've got the new Football Manager game for 2020.</p>
      <p>You've decided on the team you're going to turn into Pep Guardiola's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona,</a> you've picked your formation, shoehorned players into their new roles, identified the gaps in your squad and turned to the transfer market for some new recruits.</p>
      <p>And then, of course, you realise you haven't got any money in your bank account.</p>
      <p>It's enough to restart the game there and then, pick a new team, and hope no one noticed.</p>
      <p>But if you're up for the challenge, and need some help identifying the best players in the game that you can pick up for free, then you've come to the right place.</p>
      <p>Just note that these players are all free agents at the very, very start of the game, meaning they need to be signed in the first transfer window.</p>
      <p>If you dawdle and fail to snap them up quickly, then someone else may, and that would be a right pity, wouldn't it?</p>
