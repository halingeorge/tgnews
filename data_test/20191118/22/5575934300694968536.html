      <p><b>1.</b> Open the Start menu by pressing the Windows key, or by clicking the Windows icon at the bottom-left of the screen.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Search “Notifications” and select “Notifications and actions settings” in the search results.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>3.</b> A new menu will open. Near the top of this menu, there should be a toggle switch labelled, “Get notifications from apps and other senders.” Switch it to “Off.” This will turn off all notifications.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> Two checkboxes remain: “Show me the Windows welcome experience…” and “Get tips and tricks…” These are like tutorials – if you’re already familiar with how Windows 10 works, it’s recommended that you uncheck these boxes as well.</p>

      <p><b>5.</b> Alternatively, if you scroll down, you can turn off notifications on an individual application-by-application basis. If you turned all notifications off already, these switches will be greyed out.</p>
