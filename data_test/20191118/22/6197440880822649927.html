      <h1>Bank of America updates Android app to support Pixel 4 face unlock</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:53:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>On launch day, face unlock on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL was only <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/21/pixel-4-face-unlock-apps-support/">supported by five apps</a>, with a few more getting updated since last month. The latest is Bank of America’s Android client today.</p>
      <p>Release notes for version 8.3.11 of Bank of America for Android prominently mentions the “Ability to sign in with face unlock (Pixel 4 only).” After updating, you’ll need to enter your password one more time, and select the “Set up biometric sign-in” checkbox.</p>
      <p>After completing BofA’s process, Pixel 4 face unlock will work on all subsequent sign-in attempts. That said, you might have to tap a “Sign in with biometrics” button right next to the password field if the system-level sheet with the smilie face icon doesn’t automatically slide up from the bottom of the screen.</p>
      <p>This update that adds support for <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/google-android-biometric-api/">Android’s Biometric API</a> follows a rather big visual redesign to Bank of America’s Android app. Widely rolling out <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infonow.bofa">via the Play Store</a>, the full release notes are below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ability to sign in with face unlock (Pixel 4 only)</li>
        <li>An updated look that is sleek and modern, including a cleaner view of your Zelle® activity</li>
        <li>New Erica insights, including proactive alerts for credit cardholders when their FICO® Score changes</li>
        <li>“Saved Items” from a financial center associate so you can conveniently research and open new accounts at home</li>
        <li>Easy access to add and manage the mobile wallets where your credit/debit cards are stored</li>
      </ul>
