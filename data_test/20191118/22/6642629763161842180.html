      <p>A miniature book written by Charlotte Bronte while a teenager was bought at auction in Paris on Monday for 780,000 euros ($862,446.00) by a museum in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> whose bid was boosted by an appeal from British actress Judi Dench.</p>
      <p>Bronte wrote the unpublished manuscript, which is no larger than a matchbox, in 1830 at the age of 14. It was bought by the Bronte Parsonage Museum which is based at Bronte's childhood home in Haworth, West Yorkshire.</p>

      <p>Dench, the doyenne of British theatre and film and honorary president of the Bronte Society, had urged the public to help bring the "little book home to Haworth" by donating money.</p>
      <p>The manuscript, filled with over 4,000 tiny written words on paper stitched into a brown paper cover, had only come up for auction once before, eight years ago. On that occasion, it slipped through the museum's grasp and into a private collection.</p>
      <p>"It has rarely been seen since," the Bronte Parsonage Museum wrote on its Crowdfunder page in advance of the sale.</p>
      <p>The manuscript is made up of stories with characters from "Glass Town", an imaginary world invented by Bronte and her sisters Emily and Anne.</p>
      <p>The museum raised 84,892 pounds in public donations, exceeding the target it had set. That supplemented a fund it already raised from other sources to bid for the manuscript, which is one in a sequence of six little books written by Bronte.</p>
      <p>Five are known to survive, of which all the others are already held by the museum.</p>
