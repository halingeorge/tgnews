        <b>Ireland put in a great performance against Denmark but a 1-1 draw means they fall short of Euro 2020 qualification with the play-offs to come.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here's how we rated Mick McCarthy's side.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Darren Randolph - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Randolph could do nothing about the goal and he put the ball on David McGoldrick's head on plenty of occasions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Matt Doherty - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>It would have been an eight but for the defensive lapse that allowed Martin Braithwaite in for the Danish goal.</p>
      <p>It's a shame for Doherty because other than that he was superb.</p>
      <p>It was his best showing in a green shirt as he showed what he can do going forward, including the equalising goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shane Duffy - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Commanding in defence and he provided our biggest goal threat when McCarthy threw him up top as a Hail Mary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>John Egan - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Egan did little wrong before coming off injured at half-time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Enda Stevens - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stevens was impressive going forward like Doherty, James McClean tidied up after he made his only notable mistake.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Glenn Whelan - 7</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Whelan has plenty of critics but he was solid again, distributed the ball well and even skinned Christian Eriksen with one silky touch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jeff Hendrick - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>We were hoping for Euro 2016 Jeff Hendrick but he was anonymous again.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alan Browne - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>He was played with the hope of adding some attacking spark but besides a well hit volley in the first-half, the Preston man was too quiet.</p>
      <p>Ended up playing as an auxiliary centre-back as Duffy went up front late on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conor Hourihane - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hourihane's passing was spot on and he was often at the centre of Ireland's best play. It seemed odd that he came off for Callum Robinson, rather than the quieter Browne.</p>
      <p>Sadly for the Aston Villa man, his performance will be remembered for spurning a glorious chance to put Ireland in front.</p>
      <p>
        <b>James McClean - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Full of heart and running as always. McClean did alright and made some important tackles but his play in the final third was lacking.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David McGoldrick - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>McGoldrick won nearly every ball, even the ones hit towards him more in hope.</p>
      <p>His link-up play was great despite the fact he was often painfully isolated.</p>
      <p>If only that long-range strike was a few inches lower!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Subs:Â </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ciaran Clark - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Clark did well after coming on at half-time, one a few headers in the Danish half too as Ireland threw everything forward late on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum Robinson - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robinson brought some extra energy to the attack.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sean Maguire - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maguire looked very dangerous as Ireland pushed for late goals, it would have been nice to see him on a little bit earlier.</p>
