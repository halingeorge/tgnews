      <h1>Why do women bring down other women? Juliet Ibrahim asks Yvonne Nelson, others</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:02:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:02</time> by <a rel="author">‌ RASHAD</a></address>
      <p>Just a few days after Yvonne Nelson was accused of sabotaging a big deal for a fellow actress and Slayer, Nana Akua Addo, Juliet Ibrahim has taken to her Instagram page to question why some women take delight in pulling other women down.</p>
      <p>According to Juliet Ibrahim, it’s unwise to mock or laugh at other women when they are in a predicament.</p>

      <p>This is because one day, you or your sister might be in the same situation and it won’t be a laughing matter to you at the time, Juliet Ibrahim explained,</p>
      <p>Juliet Ibrahim went on to preach about women standing up for fellow women when it’s necessary and not trampled upon other women in order to feel good about themselves.</p>

      <p>Juliet Ibrahim wrote on Instagram:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Why do we, as women bring down other women, knowing how hard life can be for a woman? Never mock or laugh at another woman when she’s in her predicament because Sister one day you or someone close to you might be a victim of something similar or worse. In @atoasttolifebook I stated “ Sisters over bros” I believe in sisterhood, but most of us are happy being in blind competition with each other.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We need to be there and support each other even if you don’t know that woman personally. Don’t bring her down just because you envy her shine or don’t understand her and how she’s making it happen. Join forces as women and watch extremely great things happen!</i>

      <p>A few days ago, screenshots of an alleged conversation between Alex of Big Brother Naija 2018 and Nana Akua Addo hit online.</p>
      <p>From the chat, Alex was telling Nana Akua Addo that Yvonne Nelson has told her to ignore her for a planned deal because her brand stinks and it will taint the brand she was bidding to represent.</p>
      <p>Yvonne Nelson allegedly told Alex Nana Akua Adoo should not be considered at all because Ghanaians hate her brand and choosing her will affect their business in a negative manner.</p>

      <p>Nana Akua Addo and Yvonne Nelson had their public fight in 2017 after the Golden Movie Awards.</p>
      <p>Yvonne Nelson advised the actresses to channel their energies into making the dead movie industry rise again and not to Slay on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>Yvonne Nelson said:<i> ‘the energy actresses put in red carpet, they should channel it into making movies to revive the industry’.</i></p>

      <p>Nana Akua Addo who sees herself as an actress and felt offended because she was one of those people who rocked the red carpet that day.</p>
      <p>She hit back at Yvonne Nelson and educated her on how the red carpet fashion is now a full-time job that she should catch up with.</p>
      <p>Nana Akua Addo said:</p>
      <p>This Nana Akua replied on social media.<i> “RED CARPET is an industry called Fashion (SLAY) YES!! Either reinvent or help the industry grow or become a Commentator. Technology is making video and content the future.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>The industry is for TALENT. TALENT will keep you relevant in the industry long legs may get weak with time. Change is here if you can’t embrace it, join them “if you can’t beat them !!!!! IF slaying is not working for you, have you tried running with those long legs? It’s called reinvent either way Ghana is winning my break time is up back to class….”</i>

      <p>But Yvonne Nelson who was determined to shame her and others hit back describing her as a shallow-minded.</p>
