      <h1>Tata Steel unveils cost-cutting plans for Europe business, including job cuts</h1>

      <p>Tata Steel on Monday unveiled restructuring and cost-cutting plans for its Europe business, including job cuts, to arrest the decline in profitability of the business.</p>
      <p>The exact job cut figure is yet to confirmed by the company but could be up to 3,000.</p>
      <p>The Indian steel major said the changes were needed to ensure the business can thrive despite severe market headwinds and also accelerate innovation towards carbon-neutral steelmaking.</p>
      <p>“Today we are highlighting important proposals towards building a financially strong and sustainable European business, said Henrik Adam, CEO of Tata Steel in Europe, in a statement on Monday.</p>
      <p>“We plan to change how we work together to enable better cooperation and faster decision-making. This will help us become self-sustaining and cash positive in the face of unprecedented severe market conditions, enabling us to lead the way towards a carbon-neutral future, he said.</p>
      <p>The programme is focused on four areas to improve financial performance — increasing sales of higher-value steels by improving product mix and customer focus; efficiency gains by optimising production processes, supported by the application of big data and advanced analytics; lowering employment costs, leading to an estimated reduction in employee numbers of up to 3,000 across Tata Steel Europe’s operations.</p>
      <p>About two-thirds of employee numbers to be reduced are expected to be office-based (’white collar’) roles; and reduction of procurement costs through smarter sourcing and strengthening cooperation with companies within the Tata Steel group.</p>
