      <h1>Jennifer Arcuri says Boris Johnson didn't 'just have sexual intention' towards her</h1>
      <h2>Appearing on the Victoria Derbyshire show, the tech entrepreneur said Prime Minister Boris Johnson was 'very intrigued by my energy' and 'it was not just a sexual intention'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:27:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:27</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Jennifer Arcuri today refused to confirm or deny she had an affair with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> , but said the Prime Minister did not “just have a sexual intention” towards her.</p>
      <p>The model turned entrepreneur, 34, has been unable to get through to Mr Johnson since allegations emerged that her business ventures received favourable treatment when he was London Mayor.</p>
      <p>Asked whether Mr Johnson, 55, called her when he was busy at the time, she said: “Absolutely.”</p>
      <p>“Every time he told me he would call, he called me,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I was convinced this was a man of his word. I assure you, it was not just a sexual intention. He was very intrigued by my energy, my ability to get things done.”</p>

      <p>The American blasted the PM on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show for failing to answer her calls and read out a text she sent him last week.</p>
      <p>The message said: “Is this the price of loyalty? To be hung up on, ignored and blocked?</p>
      <p>“Why would I remain silent if you can’t even speak to me and I have been nothing but loyal to you?”</p>

      <p>She said: “He didn’t have to ignore me. It could have been a 30-second phone call, just to let me know that he’s acknowledging the fact that he, while he gets to be Prime Minister, gets to feed me to the wolves.</p>
      <p>“I am very upset that he could not man up and pick up the phone and call me. Why keep me away? Why treat me like the enemy? I would love an apology.”</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri's business received £126,000 in public money and she went on three foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor between 2008 and 2016.</p>

      <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct has postponed a decision on whether to investigate him for misconduct in public office.</p>
      <p>In an earlier ITV interview, she said she was “the collateral damage of his quest for greatness”.</p>
      <p>She said she wished he had declared her as an interest in official records if it “saved me this entire embarrassment”.</p>
      <p>And she accused him of allowing her to be “fed to the lions” in an “atrocious” display of behaviour.</p>
