      <p>(Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle startup Byton said on Monday it has received a distributor license from California, paving the way for the company to launch its first electric SUV vehicle, Byton M-Byte, in the United States.</p>
      <p>The license will facilitate Byton to sell and service vehicles through its own infrastructure as well as via retail partners in the country.</p>
      <p>The company will launch its electric SUV in China in 2020 and in the United States and the European Union in 2021.</p>
      <p>Byton also said it has established Byton Cars California LLC as its retail entity, and once this retail company secures a California dealer license, it will be able to sell and lease directly to customers in California and sell online in other states.</p>
      <p>The company, which has a presence in the United States and Germany as well, is among several largely Chinese-funded EV startups betting on U.S. production to compete with Tesla Inc and other auto giants in the EV space.</p>
      <p>Byton was launched in September 2017 by Future Mobility Corp, a company co-founded by former BMW and Nissan Motor executives.</p>
