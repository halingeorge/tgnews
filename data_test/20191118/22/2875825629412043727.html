      <h2>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here saw Kate Garraway get completely wiped out when she tried to push over rugby star James Haskell... and fans are living for it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:43:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:43</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>TV presenter Kate Garraway was hilariously wiped out by a large bag as she tried to push over hunky James Haskell.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old Good Morning Britain star took a running leap in attempt to knock over the rugby champion, 34, but it completely backfired.</p>
      <p>Instead, a worn out Kate fell flat on her back in the funny moment as bulky James remained standing.</p>
      <p>Kate has now been made into a meme on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> with fans commenting on the fall as they can't stop laughing.</p>
      <p>The tweet was captioned with: "When you push a door that says pull <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ", as others shared laughing faces in reaction.</p>

      <p>She recently spoke about facing one of her biggest personal fears by taking part in the 2019 series by confronting her body hang-ups.</p>
      <p>While many would fear running into giant, hairy spiders, or dangerous and deadly snakes, Kate has opened up about one of the most relatable fears of taking part in the show - the jungle shower.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the Mirror before she enters the camp on Sunday night, Kate revealed her reasons for wanting to cover up when it comes to the famous waterfall shower.</p>
      <p>"I am very nervous about that because I've got an ordinary body. I've not got a celebrity body. That's the problem, I've not got a celebrity body," she said.</p>

      <p>However, Kate added she may feel more confident the longer she remains on the show.</p>
      <p>"I'm taking in a skimpy bikini and I'm going to see if the experience of being in the jungle is enough to make me let go of that fear, and by the end of it I actually put that bikini on," she admitted.</p>
