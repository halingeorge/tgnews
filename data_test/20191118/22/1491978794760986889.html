        <i>• Seven goalscorers in Italian record victory<br/>• Switzerland win group with 6-1 win in Gibraltar</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Italy</b> produced the biggest win against European opposition in their history when they crushed <b>Armenia</b> 9-1 in Palermo. The Azzurri, who had already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/nov/18/republic-of-ireland-v-denmark-euro-2020-qualifying-live">qualified for</a> Euro 2020 as winners of Group J, had seven goalscorers with Federico Chiesa claiming their last goal in the 81st minute. Ciro Immobile and Nicolò Zaniolo were the only players to score twice.</p>
      <p><b>Spain</b> enhanced their credentials as one of the favourites for Euro 2020 by beating <b>Romania</b> 5-0 in Madrid. Gerard Moreno scored twice in 10 minutes in the first half at the Wanda Metropolitano, adding to Fabián Ruiz’s opener after only eight minutes.</p>
      <p>Romania’s Adrian Rus then scored an own goal in the final minute of the first half. Spain had already won their group and will be seeded next summer, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania">Romania</a> certain of a Nations League play-off place.</p>
      <p><b>Switzerland</b> won Group D and sealed their place in the finals with a 6-1 win away to <b>Gibraltar</b>. Cedric Itten opened the scoring for the Swiss but they had to wait until the second half before the expected glut of goals arrived.</p>
      <p>In other qualifiers <b>Finland</b>, who had already qualified, lost 2-1 in <b>Greece</b>. The winners of Euro 2004 do not even have the consolation of a play-off place.</p>
      <p><b>Sweden</b>, runners-up behind <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/spain">Spain</a> in their group, finished their campaign with a 3-0 win at home against <b>Faroe Islands</b>. Mattias Svanberg, a 20-year-old midfielder with Bologna, scored on his debut.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile <b>Norway</b>, who have a Nations League play-off place, won 2-1 in <b>Malta</b>. <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b>, also in the play-offs, beat <b>Liechtenstein</b> 3-0.</p>
