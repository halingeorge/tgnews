      <p>John, 72, discusses his operation two-years-ago and what sort of effect it had on his body. The “Tiny Dancer” singer opens up to BBC One’s “Elton John: Uncensored”, per <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7700135/Elton-John-compares-Bionic-Woman-prostate-cancer-surgery.html"><i>DailyMail</i></a>. John suffered a major infection following the surgery</p>
      <p>“I literally had to learn to walk again. I was extremely sick,” the music icon explains. “Luckily I survived it. Now I am fine. But there are very few bits of me left!”</p>
      <p>“There is no hair, a pacemaker, there are no tonsils, there is no prostate, there is no appendix,” he continues. “I have had kidney stones. I am like the ‘Bionic Woman’. I am like Lyndsay Wagner or Steve Austin. Whichever one you want to call it.”</p>
