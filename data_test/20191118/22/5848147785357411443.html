      <h1>The nine-year-old planning his PhD while his peers are playing downball</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:06:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Not content with graduating from university at the ripe old age of nine years old, Belgium’s Laurent Simons now has his sights set on a PhD in electrical engineering.</p>
      <p>At an age when most students his age are transitioning from pencils to pens, Laurent is due to earn his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Eindhoven University of Technology next month.</p>
      <p>The pre-teen says he next plans to attend medical school and learn how to create artificial organs, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/europe/university-graduate-child-genius-scli-intl/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>Described by his lecturers and tutors as “simply extraordinary”, Laurent comes from a family of doctors.</p>
      <p>But even his parents, Lydia and Alexander Simons, are hard-pressed to explain how quickly their son absorbs information.</p>
      <p>“I ate a lot of fish during the pregnancy,” Lydia joked of the so-called ‘brain food’ during an interview with CNN.</p>
      <p>While Laurent’s university is passing him through at a faster pace than usual, educational director Sjoerd Hulshof said it’s not unheard of to customise a curriculum for individuals with unique needs.</p>
      <p>“Laurent is the fastest student we have ever had here,” Mr Hulshof said.</p>
      <p>“Not only is he hyper intelligent, but also a very sympathetic boy.”</p>
      <p>Laurent has not yet decided where he’ll pursue his graduate degree, or degrees.</p>
      <p>His father doesn’t seem concerned about the pace at which his son is advancing.</p>
      <p>“He does whatever he likes,” Mr Simons said.</p>
      <p>“We need to find a balance between [him] being a child and his talents.”</p>
