      <p>The Republic of Ireland failed to automatically qualify for Euro 2020 after drawing with Denmark and will now have to earn their place at next summer’s tournament through the play-offs.</p>
      <p>Needing a win to secure qualification, the Irish were held to a 1-1 draw by Denmark at a raucous Aviva Stadium on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Matt Doherty equalised for the hosts with five minutes remaining but Ireland were unable to score again as Martin Braithwaite’s 73rd-minute opener proved pivotal.</p>

      <p>The Irish players collapsed to the ground at the final whistle while Denmark celebrated a draw that ensures they automatically qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Ireland can still join Denmark at the tournament via the play-offs, with a potential semi-final away to Wales, Slovakia or Bosnia-Herzegovina due to take place in March.</p>

      <p>Reacting to the draw, Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy said: ‘I am immensely proud of the players. They pushed them right to the limit.</p>
      <p>‘If my players and my team leave everything on the pitch I will take the result as it comes so I will have to take the defeat.</p>
      <p>‘You just need that bit of luck. We had opportunities but I am not going to criticise the lads they have been brilliant, we lost one game out of eight. Very proud of them.</p>
      <p>‘We can beat anyone in the play-offs. The players will go back to their clubs and we don’t have a game until March.</p>

      <p>‘I’ll be getting round them and reminding them it has been a good campaign and that we can play like that, so why not play like that in March.’</p>
      <p>Captain Shane Duffy, meanwhile, said: ‘It’s disappointing, I thought we were the better team and one slip has cost us.</p>
      <p>‘We believed we could beat them, it was difficult when they went 1-0 up but we kept going and we have to pick ourselves up for some big games in March.</p>

      <p>‘There is no blame in this team, we win and lose together. We pick ourselves up and we go again.</p>

      <p>‘They didn’t create that many clear-cut chances, we had a few, I had the feeling this was our game, this was our moment.</p>
      <p>‘We gave everything, but the win wasn’t there. It’s a hard one to take right now. We have scored a few late goals in this campaign but it wasn’t to be.’</p>
      <p>Striker David McGoldrick admitted it was a ‘heartbreaking’ evening for Ireland and felt the home side would have scored a decisive second goal had they had another five minutes to play.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘We gave it our all and that’s what the manager asked for.</p>
      <p>‘We deserved to win the game, but we drew and it’s heartbreaking. I had a few chances, I had a header which hit my shoulder. I have to do better as a striker and I accept that.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe another five minutes and we would’ve got a second.’</p>
