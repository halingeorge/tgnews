      <h1>‘Utterly shameless’: Nikki Haley and George Conway clash over his comments on Elise Stefanik</h1>

      <p>Nikki Haley and George Conway got into a Twitter spat over his comments about Republican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Conway, 56, referred to Stefanik as “lying trash” and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/george-conway-under-fire-for-sharing-fake-photo-of-gop-congresswoman-and-calling-her-lying-trash"><u>shared a fake photograph</u></a> of the 35-year-old Republican giving the middle finger during the impeachment hearings. Many found his comments offensive, and the comments earned a response from Haley on Monday.</p>
      <p>Haley called Conway’s remarks “pathetic,” adding, “This is absolutely uncalled for and disgusting. What is wrong with people? George Conway is the last person that can call someone ‘trash.’”</p>

      <p>Conway launched a Twitter response to Haley's tweets, claiming she is vying for the vice presidency in her latest defense of President Trump, and he recalled recent comments in which she said she <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nikki-haley-trump-is-truthful-and-i-never-doubted-his-fitness-for-office">believes the president is “truthful.”</a></p>
      <p>“Oh, @NikkiHaley, just the other day you said that the world’s biggest pathological liar, @realDonaldTrump, was a ‘truthful’ man. *That’s* the very essence of disgusting, trashy, and pathetic — utterly shameless and transparent dishonesty,” Conway tweeted, later adding, “You’ll say anything to get the vice-presidential nomination, won’t you, @NikkiHaley?”</p>

      <p>Haley, who was Trump’s U.N. ambassador at the beginning of his presidency, has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/no-truth-whatsoever-nikki-haley-denies-rumors-that-shes-gunning-for-pences-position"><u>denied that she is edging</u></a> her way onto Trump’s 2020 ticket to replace Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
      <p>Conway has also been advocating for Trump’s impeachment, even <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-dont-frankly-want-to-be-on-television-george-conway-makes-rare-tv-appearance-for-impeachment-hearings">providing commentary on MSNBC</a> during the impeachment hearings last week. Conway is <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/shes-in-a-cult-george-conway-can-make-marriage-work-if-kellyanne-leaves-white-house"><u>married to Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway</u></a>, who has been a staunch supporter of the president and successfully managed his 2016 campaign.</p>
