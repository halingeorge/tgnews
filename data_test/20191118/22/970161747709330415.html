      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> believe they can sign England sensation Jadon Sancho and prolific striker Erling Braut Haaland during the January transfer window, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have endured a dismal start to the 2019-20 campaign and are ready to spend big in January to boost the club’s hopes of qualifying for next season’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite winning two of their last three games, United will resume the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> campaign after the international break sitting just seventh in the table, nine points adrift of the top four.</p>

      <p>Ed Woodward brought three players – Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James – to Old Trafford last summer and is ready to back under-fire manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> with another spending spree.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have expressed interest in signing Sancho and Haaland and <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-ready-to-spend-big-on-sancho-and-haaland-in-january/5nnf2uw06tag15uyshqnoic49">Goal</a> say there is optimism at the Theatre of Dreams that the highly-rated duo will be joining in January.</p>

      <p>It is claimed Woodward has renewed hope of landing England international Sancho after the 19-year-old clashed with Borussia Dortmund manager Lucien Favre.</p>
      <p>Sancho was fined and dropped from the first-team after returning late from international duty earlier in the season, and then subbed off in the first-half of Dortmund’s defeat to Bayern Munich two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The potential unease has given Manchester United fresh optimism of striking a deal with Dortmund, but any transfer would cost around £100million.</p>
      <p>Woodward is also keen to bring Haaland to the Premier League, with the Norway international scoring a staggering 22 goals in 18 matches so far this season.</p>

      <p>According to Goal, a deal worth £85m is being lined up and Manchester United would be willing to send Haaland back to Red Bull Salzburg for the remainder of the 2019-20 campaign after capturing his signature.</p>
      <p>United’s pursuits of Sancho and Haaland may ensure the Manchester club shelve their interest in West Ham midfielder Declan Rice and Juventus forward Mario Mandzukic.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer’s United, who beat Brighton before the international break, travel to Premier League new-boys Sheffield United on Sunday afternoon.</p>
