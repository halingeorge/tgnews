      <h1>FEC warns de Blasio over presidential fundraising irregularities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:24:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:24</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Marsh</a></address>
      <p>Federal regulators slapped Mayor Bill de Blasio’s failed presidential campaign with new questions Monday about its fundraising tactics — two months after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/20/bill-de-blasio-pulls-the-plug-on-his-sputtering-presidential-bid/">he dropped out of the race.</a></p>
      <p>The Federal Election Commission wrote his federal political action committee, Fairness PAC, Sunday flagging $123,000 in “apparent excessive contributions.”</p>
      <p>Hizzoner’s campaign reimbursed the federal Fairness PAC for polling expenses — but failed to cut the check by the deadline, according to the letter that was filed by the FEC.</p>
      <p>Reimbursements are allowed but were required by no more than 30 days after de Blasio <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/bill-de-blasio-officially-launches-2020-presidential-campaign/">declared his national candidacy</a> on May 16.</p>
      <p>Outside of that month-long window, contributions from political committees are limited to $5,000 a year, the letter states.</p>
      <p>The reimbursement from the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/02/de-blasio-blames-alarm-clock-after-showing-up-late-to-tv-interview/">perpetually tardy mayor</a> happened about two weeks too late, on June 30.</p>
      <p>The FEC letter warns that failure to “adequately respond” by Dec. 23 “could result in an audit or enforcement action.”</p>
      <p>It adds that deadline extensions are not allowed.</p>
      <p>This complaint <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/20/feds-demand-answers-about-de-blasios-campaign-fundraising/">is separate from another FEC probe</a> into de Blasio’s use of his state political account to pay for some of his presidential campaign’s expenses.</p>
      <p>Jon Paul Lupo, a de Blasio spokesman, said “today’s letter about a payment that was properly reported four months ago by both Fairness PAC and De Blasio 2020 is neither new, nor conclusive.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to work with the FEC on any pending issues about reimbursement timing,” Lupo said.</p>
