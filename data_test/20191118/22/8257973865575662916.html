      <h1>Pompeo: United States will not consider Israeli West Bank settlements illegal</h1>

      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- The Trump administration declared Monday that it will no longer consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank a violation of international law.</p>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of State <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mike-Pompeo/?tps=1">Mike Pompeo</a> announced the change in policy during a press conference Monday afternoon, stating U.S. policy on the matter has been inconsistent and that declaring the settlements illegal had not helped to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace.</p>
      <p>"After carefully studying all sides of the legal debate, this administration agrees with President Regan: the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law," Pompeo said.</p>
      <p>Pompeo clarified that the United States would express no view on the legal status of "any individual settlement" in the West Bank and would leave the determination to Israeli courts.</p>
      <p>He added that the U.S. was also not "addressing or prejudging the ultimate status of the West Bank," saying Israelis and Palestinians must resolve the issue themselves.</p>
      <p>"The hard truth is there will never be a judicial resolution to the conflict and arguments about who is right and wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace," he said.</p>
      <p>The deal sends a blow to Palestinians who seek to establish a state independent from Israel.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Benjamin_Netanyahu/?tps=1">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/04/06/Netanyahu-plans-to-annex-West-Bank-settlements-if-re-elected/6771554590136/">pledged to annex</a> West Bank settlements if re-elected to the post.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is currently tasked with forming a government with political rival Benny Gantz, who applauded the decision on Monday.</p>
      <p>"The fate of the settlements should be determined by agreements that meet security requirements to promote peace," he <a href="https://twitter.com/gantzbe/status/1196516965449379841">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>
