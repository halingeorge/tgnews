      <p>I'm A Celebrity fans were demanding to know where shamed Kiosk Keith was after noticing he was missing.</p>
      <p>Some I'm A Celebrity viewers questioned where Kiosk Keith had gone when Jacqueline Jossa and Andrew Maxwell finished their Dingo Dollar challenge.</p>
      <p>The celebrities reached the Outback Shack and were greeted by popcorn, crisps and Kiosk Kev.</p>
      <p>Kev started doing shifts at the shack last series after Kiosk Keith was sacked back in 2018.</p>
      <p>Keith, real name Raymond Grant, was accused of turning up drunk to work and behaving inappropriately towards a female colleague.</p>

      <p>Keitg mysteriously disappeared part way through the 2017 series with hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly assuring fans he was under the weather and would be back.</p>
      <p>But he didn't return though, and in January 2018, show bosses confirmed Keith had been sacked.</p>
      <p>ITV said in a statement: “Ray is no longer under contract on the show. There are no plans for him to return this year.”</p>
