      <h1>Aussies care more about home’s pet-friendliness than living close to friends</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:10:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/eblack/" target="_blank">Euan Black</a></address>
      <p>A new Suncorp survey has found Australians prioritise pets over friends when looking for a new home.</p>
      <p>The Brisbane-based bank asked more than 1600 Australians what home features and lifestyle factors most influenced their search for a new home.</p>
      <p>Most placed more importance on finding a pet-friendly home than one close to friends and family.</p>
      <p>Suncorp’s executive general manager for lending, Glenn Haslam, said the survey showed pets were “adored members of the modern Australian family”, and that this was “even more true for younger generations”.</p>
      <p>Of those aged 18 to 34, 59 per cent said a home’s pet-friendliness was more important than living near their mates.</p>
      <p>That Australians care more about a home’s pet-friendliness than moving close to friends and family might surprise some readers.</p>
      <p>But it made perfect sense to 28-year-old renter Hayley O’loughlin.</p>

      <p>A lawyer and dog owner living at New Farm, Brisbane, Ms O’loughlin describes Winston, her six-year-old toy cavoodle, as “the sweetest boy in the world”, “one of the family”, and her and her husband’s “first-born child”.</p>
      <p>She told <i>The New Daily </i>finding a pet-friendly property had never been that difficult – though she said that was probably because Winston only weighs six kilograms and doesn’t shed hair.</p>
      <p>“Whenever we were looking for a place, the first thing we said is, ‘Are you pet-friendly, because we have a dog, and we need him to live with us’. And we never found any issues with that,” Ms O’loughlin said.</p>
      <p>“We included favourable images [in the application]. We sent them photos of [Winston] in a Hawaiian shirt, and tried to win them over that way, [by saying] ‘look, he’s sweet and never barks, and he’s not going to cause anyone any trouble’.</p>
      <p>“Because I think the biggest concern for property managers and owners, particularly if you’re in a body corporate, is if the dog barks and annoys other people.”</p>

      <p>According to tenants’ rights advocates, the ease with which Ms O’loughlin has navigated the rental market as a pet owner is the exception rather than the rule.</p>
      <p>Rent.com.au CEO Greg Bader said finding a pet-friendly property is “bloody hard” for most renters – even though 62 per cent of Australian households own pets, <a href="https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/how-many-pets-are-there-in-australia/">according to the RSPCA</a>.</p>
      <p>“That’s the simple truth,” he told <i>The New Daily. </i></p>
      <p>“Of all the properties we have in Australia, about 10 per cent say ‘pet-friendly’, you can have a pet. About 50 per cent say ‘no pets’, and about 40 per cent don’t specify.”</p>
      <p>Mr Bader said landlords need to appreciate they are leasing a home, not just an asset, and provide renters more freedom to make spaces their own.</p>
      <p>Tenants Union of NSW senior policy officer Leo Patterson Ross agreed.</p>
      <p>“I think there’s a lot of mythology amongst landlords and agents about how much damage pets can cause. We really haven’t seen evidence that it’s a widespread problem,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Most of the time, people who have pets as part of their family take care of their pets very well and take care of their home very well.”</p>

      <p>Tenants in the Australian Capital Territory can own a pet without seeking their landlord’s permission, and Victorian renters will have very similar rights when new laws come into effect in July 2020.</p>
      <p>But tenants in most other states still have to seek written permission from their landlords before inviting a pet into their home.</p>
      <p>And landlords in Western Australia are allowed to charge renters a “pet bond” of up to $260.</p>
      <p>“That these rules exist at all is an indication of just how much power landlords have to set the agenda, to set the culture around renting,” Mr Patterson Ross said.</p>
      <p>“Which is why we need much more sensible and active engagement from government on mitigating that power.”</p>
