        <b>WASHINGTON, (Sputnik) - The US Supreme Court has temporarily overridden a legal ruling that required accountant to hand over the President Donald Trump’s tax records to impeachment investigators, according to a decision announced on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"IT IS ORDERED that the mandate of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, case No. 19-5142, is hereby stayed pending receipt of a response, due on or before Thursday, November 21, 2019, by 3 p.m. ET (Eastern Time)," <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111819zr_6537.pdf">the ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts said</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>On Thursday, attorneys for Trump asked the Supreme Court last to let him keep his tax returns secret, requesting that the US high court reverse a ruling compelling his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA to turn over his tax <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911121077291924-us-supreme-court-allows-lawsuit-against-gunmaker-over-school-massacre/">returns to the Manhattan district attorney</a>.</p>

      <p>If the Supreme Court justices <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909121076780166-us-supreme-court-allows-nationwide-enforcement-of-trump-admins-asylum-restrictions/">agree to consider the case</a>, it will pave the way for a landmark dispute over the reach of presidential immunity during the 2020 presidential campaign and the current impeachment proceedings in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives against the president.</p>
