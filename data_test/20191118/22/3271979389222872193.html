      <p><b>Barbra Streisand</b> and<b> James Brolin</b> never got a $400 million divorce, as a tabloid claimed one year ago today. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked the story as soon as it was published. One year later, the happy spouses are still together.</p>
      <p>The phony report, published by the <i>National Enquirer</i> on November 18, 2018, alleged that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/barbra-streisand-james-brolin-divorce/">Streisand and Brolin were divorcing</a> due to his wandering eye and her controlling attitude. The story quoted a so-called “insider” as saying the couple had “been moving in different directions, burying themselves in their careers and only interacting when they fight.” The “source” further predicted that the tow would be “done before the New Year.” Not only were they still together well after the new year, they’re still together as the next one approaches.</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> presented plenty of evidence at the time of the bogus article, and in the year since, there’s plenty more to point to. In July, the <i>Funny Girl</i> star <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzYn2tKnpnJ/">posted a throwback picture of the couple</a> on their wedding day in 1998 to celebrate 21 years of marriage. Additionally, <a href="https://youtu.be/LBojyNBljHU">Brolin appeared on <i>CBS This Morning</i></a> in April and described his marriage as “really good.” It’s clear the two are in a very healthy place.</p>
      <p>Back in June, however, just before the couple celebrated their 21st anniversary, the <i>Enquirer</i> was back at it. The magazine wrote a false article claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/barbra-streisand-heart-attack-health-truth/">Streisand was on the brink of a heart attack</a> over marriage problems with Brolin. “Barbra has looked and acted like she has the weight of the world on her shoulders,” a so-called “source” told the magazine. “It’s no wonder she’s on the verge of a collapse!” <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the story after checking with our own source close to the couple, who assured us it was all fabricated. As usual, time has proven our insider to be more reliable.</p>
      <p>Just one week later, the <i>Enquirer</i> alleged <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/barbra-streisand-james-brolin-retire-furious/">Streisand was furious with Brolin for refusing to retire</a>. At the time, Brolin was starring in the successful sitcom, <i>Life In Pieces, </i>and the outlet purported this was driving his wife crazy as she thought they should be spending more time with each other and working less. The story also touched on Streisand’s alleged health problems from its report a week earlier, but those were no more true a week later. Of course, the magazine left out the fact that Streisand had a number of big concerts planned for 2019, so she’s not retiring or in poor health. And unsurprisingly, the outlet made no mention of the divorce story it ran eight months earlier, as it didn’t fit into its newest made-up narrative. It’s safe to say the tabloid has zero insight into the couple’s marriage.</p>
