      <h1>Dallas Cowboys Cornerback Is Now Out For The Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:30:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Dallas Cowboys cornerback Anthony Brown will miss the rest of the 2019 season due to a triceps injury, Dallas head coach Jason Garrett announced today.</p>
      <p>Brown will undergo season-ending surgery to repair a torn triceps, which he suffered in yesterday’s win over the Detroit Lions. Brown was one of several key Cowboys to exit the game in the fourth quarter with injuries.</p>
      <p>Defensive lineman DeMarcus Lawrence and safety Xavier Woods both returned after getting hurt, so they’re likely fine moving forward. Offensive lineman La’El Collins injured his left knee and his status is more uncertain.</p>

      <p>Brown appeared in nine games this season, making four starts. He recorded 17 tackles and five passes defensed.</p>
      <p>Brown has been a key contributor in the secondary for Dallas since being drafted in the sixth round out of Purdue in 2016. Considering the Cowboys’ struggles against the pass this year, Brown could be a key loss.</p>
      <p>At 6-4, the Cowboys are one game ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles for first place in the NFC East.</p>
