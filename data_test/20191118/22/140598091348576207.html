      <h1>England frontline as good as any team at Euro 2020, insists Gareth Southgate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/matt-law/" target="_blank">Matt Law</a></address>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate already believes there will not be a better front three in next summer’s European Championships and Marcus Rashford has acknowledged the forward talent pool he is part of is “frightening.”</p>
      <p>Southgate’s team finished Euro 2020 qualifying with 37 goals, of which 26 of them were netted by members of his front three.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane top scored with 12, followed by Raheem Sterling on eight and Rashford netted for the third successive <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/17/kosovo-vs-england-euro-2020-qualifiers-live-score-latest-updates/">qualifier against Kosovo</a>. Jadon Sancho chipped in with two, while Tammy Abraham scored his first international goal against Montenegro last week.</p>
      <p>There will be much focus between now and June on how England can find the right formulas in defence and midfield, but Southgate does not need to worry about his forwards.</p>
      <p>The strength in depth was perfectly demonstrated over the course of England’s final two qualifiers. When S<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/16/injury-rules-joe-gomez-englands-euro-2020-qualifier-kosovo-jordan/">terling was forced to sit out the Montenegro game</a>, Kane scored a hat-trick, Rashford netted and Sancho provided the assist for substitute Abraham.</p>
      <p>Callum Hudson-Odoi failed to take his chance in Kosovo, but when Southgate needed fresh impetus, Rashford replaced the Chelsea teenager and scored, Sterling chalked up two assists on his return to the team and Kane was on target for a sixth successive match.</p>
      <p>Southgate’s first-choice front three are currently Kane, Sterling and Rashford, but the Manchester United star believes that it is the options England have in that department that make them so devastating.</p>
      <p>Asked about playing with Kane and Sterling, Rashford said: “Yeah I think it is obviously a good combination, but we have played games without that particular front three and it is frightening what we can do as a group of attackers.</p>
      <p>“You have to use it to your advantage and maybe it isn't working in one game for that three and someone has to come in and make the difference – we have to use that to our advantage, 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>“The competition is good for the team, but I have been in two tournaments now and the squad is so important. And with the qualities that every individual has in this team, it is something we have to use to our advantage.</p>
      <p>“People are going to be playing at different moments, but when you are on the pitch you have to do your best and try to come up with the goods.”</p>
      <p>Southgate recognises that he is in a privileged position to have so much attacking talent at his disposal and that it could make up for the deficiencies at the back.</p>
      <p>“When you look at that front three, that will be as good as any team in the tournament,” said Southgate. “There’s no doubt in my mind about that.</p>
      <p>“There’s competition for them, they know that if they are not on it then there are young ones that are only going to get better, that are coming through as well.</p>
      <p>“So, absolutely, we often look, you know, you tend to look at what we aren’t doing well and we sometimes ignore the weaknesses of the opponents. Over the next two months, I really want to spend time studying all the other top teams and exactly how they’ve been playing and prepare, as early as we can, for all the games we’re going to face.”</p>
      <p>Kane scored his 20th goal for club and country in Kosovo, while Rashford now has nine in his last 10.</p>
      <p>“It has been a good month-and-a-half, but you take it a game at a time and just try and keep improving,” said Rashford.</p>
      <p>On Kane, Rashford added: “His finishing is second to none. If you want someone to rely on and is going to get you goals, he is the man for the job.</p>
      <p>“So for us playing in and around him it gives us a lot of confidence because if there is a game where you only get one chance, you know that if it falls to him it is more than likely going to be a goal. It does breed confidence throughout the team.</p>
      <p>“I think he has done that terrifically when you speak about being a leader, to lead by example is always the best way and he has been very good for England.”</p>
      <p>On his captain, Southgate said: “I think most countries in the world would give for a No 9 like him.”</p>
