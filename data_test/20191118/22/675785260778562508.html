      <h2>The England boss believes his side are among the continent's best and deserve to be one of the top seeds at next summer's finals, where they will begin at Wembley</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> insists <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> will not be scared of expectation levels going into Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>England qualified among the top seeds and are also one of the favourites to win the tournament with games being staged at Wembley.</p>
      <p>It is a tag which has weighed heavily on the shoulders of previous generations but Southgate says his current crop of players will not be intimidated.</p>
      <p>And they have enough quality to live up to their hype.</p>
      <p>Three Lions boss Southgate said: “I think we’ve dealt with that well over the last 18 months.</p>

      <p>“We’ve not shirked from that in these qualifying matches where, in the past, there’s been a tension around the performances and the style of the games.</p>
      <p>“So the players have the belief, and we’ve got to keep giving them that belief, but we don’t tell them lies, we are pretty honest with our appraisals of their performances and the sorts of matches they’re going in to and they keep reaching those targets.</p>
      <p>“But it’s about what’s next and I know in the end, we’ll always be judged ultimately by the tournaments in the summer.</p>
      <p>“We could sit here and say we’re ranked here or ranked there, but what we have done over a period of time now is we’ve been ranked in the top four or five since the World Cup, and we’ve earned that because our results against teams in the Nations League and during the World Cup.</p>

      <p>“We’re there on merit but you always have to keep proving that.</p>
      <p>“The teams that were ranked top four going into the World Cup didn’t end up there. There’s no opportunity to switch off and we keep looking to improve.”</p>
      <p>Southgate also believes that England will have the best No.9 at the Euros with Harry Kane and the forward line is strong enough to frighten opponents.</p>
      <p>Southgate said: “Most countries in the world would give for a No 9 like him (Kane).</p>
      <p>"I think that when you look at that front three, that will be as good as any team in the tournament. There’s no doubt in my mind about that.</p>
      <p>“There’s competition for them, they know that if they are not on it then there are young ones that are only going to get better, that are coming through as well.</p>
      <p>“Over the next two months, I really want to spend time studying all the other top teams and exactly how they’ve been playing and prepare, as early as we can, for all the games we’re going to face.”</p>
