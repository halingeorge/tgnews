      <p>While a Regina Provincial Court judge found Jacob Charles Badger responsible for a shooting that badly damaged a man’s hand, a struggle for the gun prior to the blast helped persuade the judge to spare Badger an attempted murder conviction.</p>
      <p>“I infer that Mr. Badger accidentally discharged the shotgun during a brief wrestling match with (the complainant),” Judge Murray Hinds said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Unable to conclude Badger intended to kill the complainant, Hinds instead found the 27-year-old man guilty of aggravated assault.</p>
      <p>Badger <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/crime/jacob-badger-denies-shotgun-shooting">unsuccessfully argued he had nothing to do with the shooting</a>, which occurred on April 10, 2018 at a house on the 1900 block of Winnipeg Street.</p>
      <p>Hinds didn’t buy that part of Badger’s testimony, but he struggled as well with that of the complainant, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/crime/identification-evidence-allowed-against-accused-shooter">who told the court he doesn’t remember the incident and doesn’t know who shot him</a>.</p>
      <p>“In particular, I do not believe (the complainant) does not know who shot him,” Hinds said. “Overall, I found (the complainant) to be a reluctant witness who did not want to implicate the accused, Jacob Badger.”</p>
      <p>In convicting Badger, Hinds turned to two elements of the evidence: the fact Badger had “a unique opportunity to have taken part in the shooting,” and two “spontaneous utterances” made by the complainant at the scene, identifying Badger as the shooter.</p>
      <p>Court heard Badger — known to residents of the house as “Jake from State Farm” — was visiting the Winnipeg Street residence early that morning, but left. Less than 15 minutes later, two masked men walked in. One pointed a double-barrelled shotgun at the complainant’s head.</p>
      <p>The complainant grabbed the gun barrel with his right hand and a brief struggle ensued, during which the gun went off. The complainant suffered a gruesome wound to his hand and buckshot injuries to his legs and chest.</p>
      <p>A 9-1-1 call made by the complainant’s mother contained the first clue as to the shooter’s identity. Having been asked on the recorded call who had shot him, the man responded, “F—g Jake from State Farm.” Minutes later, while he was being loaded into an ambulance, the complainant pointed out Badger — standing nearby while being arrested by police — and said something to the effect of, “That’s the guy who shot me,” police testified.</p>
      <p>While Badger’s hands were found to contain gunshot residue, Hinds couldn’t make much of it as the officer handcuffing Badger wore gloves possibly contaminated by gunshot residue from his own service weapon. Hinds concluded, based on evidence heard during trial, it was possible the residue found on Badger was transferred by the officer.</p>
      <p>Despite the severity of the injuries and the fact a shotgun was used, Hinds had a reasonable doubt <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/crime/closing-arguments-heard-in-shotgun-shooting-case">about Badger’s alleged intent to kill argued by the Crown</a>. Hinds referred to the struggle for the gun and the fact Badger didn’t persist in his attack following the shotgun blast, finding Badger’s intent that night might as easily have been “to threaten or intimidate” the complainant.</p>
      <p>The case was set over to Nov. 27 for Crown and defence counsel to decide on a date for sentencing submissions.</p>
