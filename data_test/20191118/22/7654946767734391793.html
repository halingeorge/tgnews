      <p>Takes one to know one.</p>
      <p>A Miami professor and expert on organized crime has been charged with laundering dirty money from Venezuela — and pocketing more than $250,000 for himself.</p>
      <p>University of Miami professor Bruce Bagley, who co-edited the 2015 tome “Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime, and Violence in the Americas Today,” was charged Monday in Manhattan federal court with channeling some $2.5 million in dirty money into the U.S., according to court papers.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim the 73-year-old international relations educator opened bank accounts for the sole purpose of moving money for corrupt foreign nationals, accepting 14 deposits between November 2017 and October 2018.</p>
      <p>The money came from the United Arab Emirates and Swiss bank accounts, the complaint says.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Bagley received $200,000 per deposit, and would then withdraw around 90 percent of the funds via cashier’s check, which was named out to a person described in court papers as a “Colombian individual.”</p>
      <p>That unnamed individual allegedly told Bagley the funds were “proceeds from foreign bribery and embezzlement stolen from the Venezuelan people,” according to court papers.</p>
      <p>The professor is facing two counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>
      <p>He’s expected to appear before a judge in Florida Monday, ahead of his transfer to New York.</p>
      <p>Bagley faces up to 20 years behind bars if convicted.</p>
