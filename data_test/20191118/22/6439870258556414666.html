      <p>CONCORD, N.C. (WBTV) - <i>From Charlotte Motor Speedway:</i> Racing fans acquainted with the lights, cameras and action of America’s Home for Racing will receive a culture shock on Friday, when Speedway Christmas presented by Cook Out lights up the night at Charlotte Motor Speedway.</p>
      <p>The 10th edition of Speedway Christmas presented by Cook Out – the largest drive-through lights show in the Southeast – will showcase a staggering 4 million lights on a 3.75-mile course, allowing Charlotte Motor Speedway visitors an incomparable Christmas experience. Santa's Safari serves as this year’s themed portion of the drive-through lights display, featuring safari animals from the Serengeti. The whimsical displays meld the holidays and the African plains into a fascinating exhibition of lights.</p>
      <p>“We work 6 days a week, minimum of 10 hours a day, getting closer to opening which is Friday, we put in 12,13,14 hours a day," said Michael Gibson of Charlotte Motor Speedway.</p>
