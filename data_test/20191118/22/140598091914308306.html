      <p>When <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/17/kosovo-vs-england-euro-2020-qualifiers-live-score-latest-updates/">Fikayo Tomori was introduced as an 84th-minute substitute against Kosovo</a>, it not only committed the defender to England but also meant that nine of the national team’s last 21 debutants have graduated from the Chelsea academy.</p>
      <p>The fact Tomori was on the pitch in time to see Mason Mount become the youngest Chelsea player to score for England since Jimmy Greaves only underlined the influence the Stamford Bridge club are now having on the national team.</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham scored his first England goal in the victory over Montenegro last week and Callum Hudson-Odoi started in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>There could be more Chelsea graduates in Gareth Southgate’s Euro 2020 squad with midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek recovering from injury, while right-back Reece James could yet make a late run.</p>
      <p>As well as Tomori, Mount, Abraham, Hudson-Odoi and Loftus Cheek, Chelsea have also taken pride from the international debuts of Declan Rice, Dominic Solanke, Nathaniel Chalobah and Jack Cork, who all joined the club between the ages of six and 10 before eventually moving on.</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/07/fikayo-tomori-talks-england-call-up-frank-lampards-chelsea-plan/">the number of Chelsea graduates were put to Tomori</a>, the 21-year-old said: “Oh really? Yeah that is crazy.</p>

      <p>“I’m not too sure how it has happened, we just want to play football. We enjoy playing football for the club, we want to keep on improving and obviously the manager’s given us a chance to show ourselves in the Champions League and Premier League.</p>
      <p>“On the biggest stage, when you’re playing well the England guys are going to be watching. We’ve just tried to take our opportunities as they’ve come and, obviously, I’m happy that all of us have made our debuts.”</p>
      <p>Mount was 20 years and 311 days when he scored against Kosovo on Sunday night, making him Chelsea’s youngest England goalscorer since Greaves, who was 20 years and 277 days, in November 1960.</p>
      <p>“Mason’s been working so hard, he’s had a few caps and he’s come close (to scoring) a couple of times,” said Tomori. “I think against Montenegro he had a shot but it got put down as an own goal, so for him to get that goal, that was a very proud moment for him and I think a bit of a relief for him as well.”</p>
      <p>The pair were playing together on loan at Derby County in the Championship last season and Tomori added: “I think if you asked him the same question 12 months ago about making his England debut, I think he’d have been a bit, not weirded out, but a bit confused.</p>
      <p>“Obviously he got called up last year as well, but the fact he’s played now and scored a goal, whereas 12 months ago he was in the Championship – it’s a crazy journey.”</p>
      <p>Tomori was eligible for both Canada and Nigeria before earning his first competitive cap against Kosovo, but the defender has revealed <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/22/chelsea-defender-fikayo-tomori-reveals-extra-support-place-bulgaria/">he had already decided to commit himself to England </a>after being called up to the last two squads.</p>
      <p>“As a little kid, you want to make your debut for England,” said Tomori. “To get into the squad was one thing, but then your debut is another thing, so obviously it was a very proud moment for me.</p>
      <p>“I think once I got the call from England last month, it (my future) was pretty much finalised, it was just about getting my cap. People still talked about the fact that I hadn’t played and could still switch, but it never really crossed my mind.</p>
      <p>“If you told me 12 months ago that I’d make my England debut, I’d probably have looked at you funny because it just seemed so far away, but now that I’m here I’m grateful. It’s been a lot of hard work and determination, a lot of focus, and, hopefully, I can get more caps and maintain that focus I’ve shown.”</p>
