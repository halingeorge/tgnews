      <p>ATLANTA -- Fast food chain Chick-fil-A will no longer fund two organizations that have historically been against same-sex marriage, according to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/chick-fil-longer-fund-anti-lgbtq-organizations/story?id=67111125">ABC News.</a></p>
      <p>The Georgia-based chain has been under fire from the LGBTQ community for reportedly donating money to The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/chick-fil-longer-fund-anti-lgbtq-organizations/story?id=67111125">ABC News</a> it will refocus its donations to groups centered on "hunger, homelessness and education" in the new year.</p>
      <p>"Beginning in 2020 the Chick-fil-A Foundation will introduce a more focused giving approach, donating to a smaller number of organizations working exclusively in the areas of hunger, homelessness and education," Chick-fil-A said in a statement Monday.</p>
      <p>"We have also proactively disclosed our 2018 tax filing and a preview of 2019 gifts to date on chick-fil-afoundation.org," the statement added. "The intent of charitable giving from the Chick-fil-A Foundation is to nourish the potential in every child."</p>
      <p>Tim Tassopoulos, the president and COO of Chick-fil-A, added that "no organization will be excluded from future consideration -- faith-based or non-faith-based."</p>
      <p>The chain currently boasts more than 2,400 restaurants across the country.</p>
      <p>Its stance on LGBTQ rights has been the subject of boycotts, anti-boycotts and more for years, since CEO Dan Cathy first drew condemnation from activists in 2012 when he said he supported "the biblical definition of the family unit" -- marriage only between a man and woman.</p>
