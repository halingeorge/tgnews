        <b>Ireland are down but not out after a 1-1 draw with Denmark at the Aviva Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s side went into this evening’s qualifier clash with the Danes, a team they’ve played six times in two years now, knowing that a win would seal a place at Euro 2020 next summer.</p>
      <p><a href="http://fai.ie/">The Boys in Green</a> put in a spirited performance but yet again lacked the cutting edge needed in front of goals. Denmark were poor but a lapse in concentration at the back allowed Martin Braithwaite to poke home before Ireland responded through Matt Doherty to set up a tense and thrilling finale.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/ireland-denmark-player-ratings-euro-2020/">However, Ireland couldn’t get that elusive second goal they needed on a night were most supporters will have left the stadium feeling down but proud of the performance.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Following the game, Liam Brady and Richie Sadlier both praised the Irish effort as having been one of the best performances in years.</p>

      <p>While Didi Hamann agreed that the performance was great, he was adamant in his assessment that Ireland did not warrant a place in the finals given the basis of their performances throughout the qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>“I have to agree, I don’t think there’s any doubt that this has been the best performance in the whole qualifying campaign,” Hamann said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t buy into all this, this has been the best performance if we’d played like this in the two years or 18 months before because if you look at the whole qualifying campaign. They played eight games and scored seven goals. They didn’t get what they deserved tonight but over the whole qualifying campaign, I don’t think the team did enough to warrant a place in the finals.</p>
