      <h1>I'm a Celeb viewers blast decision to send Kate to main camp over Caitlyn 'a joke'</h1>
      <h2>Viewers were furious that Kate Garraway was moved to the more comfortable camp over Caitlyn Jenner, who was in tears that morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:22:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:22</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Viewers fumed at tonight's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> after they slammed the decision to send <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kate-garraway">Kate Garraway</a> to the main camp.</p>
      <p>Kate and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> completed a harrowing Bushtucker trial where they were trapped in a tank with cockroaches, crickets and rats.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, they were told that the Snake Rock camp, which includes Jacqueline Jossa, Ian Wright, James Haskell and Andrew Maxwell, had chosen one of them to move into the main camp.</p>
      <p>In Snake Rock, life is hard and campmates sleep on the floor with a diet of just rice and beans.</p>

      <p>Things are much nicer in the main camp, with the added bonus of not being eligible for Bushtucker trials.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec revealed that the campmate lucky enough to be chosen to move into the main camp was Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn had a difficult morning in the camp, crying and already missing her family.</p>

      <p>Plus, she performed much better than Kate in the Bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>Because of this, viewers took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to call the decision to move her to main camp instead of Caitlyn unfair.</p>
      <p>"The way caitlyn deserved to go to the main camp. kate just f****d up that whole thing tbh", said one.</p>

      <p>"Kate is a f****n wuss I'd be so annoyed if I was Caitlyn, blaming all the failure on her", ranted another.</p>
      <p>"Kate is very annoying, fuming she's in the main camp", said a third.</p>
      <p>"Kate literally did s**t all in the trial and gets to go to main camp? What a JOKEEE, Caitlyn Jenner deserves to go", exclaimed a fourth.</p>

      <p>Another added: "Kate garraway did not deserve to go to main camp whinging woman".</p>
      <p>"But gutted for Caitlyn though to be fair, Kate seemed in much better spirits even before going to main camp", pointed out another.</p>
      <p>Kate's wails while she attempted the Bushtucker trial also seemed to get on viewers' nerves.</p>

      <p>"Can we not have Kate do the next trial??? Her voice is so irritating", requested one.</p>
      <p>"Actually tempted to mute the tv during the trial just so I don’t have to listen to Kate whining", said another.</p>
      <p>"Oh my god I can’t even cope with Kate she’s the most irritating person, the critters are CRITTERS they will crawl wherever the f**k they want?! SHES SO ANNOYING", a third ranted.</p>
