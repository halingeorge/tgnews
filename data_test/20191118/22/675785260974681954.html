      <h2>ARGENTINA 2-2 URUGUAY: The Barcelona superstar score one and made another in Tel Aviv in the battle between South American rivals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:01:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author">Press Association, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/press-association/</a></address>
      <p>Lionel Messi converted an added-time penalty as Argentina salvaged a 2-2 draw against their South American rivals Uruguay in a friendly in Tel Aviv.</p>
      <p>Three days after marking his return from a three-month international ban by scoring the winner against Brazil, Messi once again underscored his value to his country.</p>
      <p>He floated a precise 63rd-minute free-kick from which Sergio Aguero headed home to cancel out Edison Cavani's 34th-minute opener for the home side.</p>
      <p>And after Luis Suarez put Uruguay back in front from a set-piece, Messi's persistence paid off after Martin Caceres had been harshly penalised for handball in the box.</p>

      <p>Argentina had dominated the early exchanges and came close to breaking the deadlock in the 13th minute when Paulo Dybala had a shot blocked in a crowded box.</p>
      <p>Uruguay lost defender Sebastian Coates to an apparent hamstring strain shortly afterwards but they continued to grow into the game with Suarez asserting his presence.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayans' patience was rewarded in the 34th minute when Suarez knocked on a superb cross by Lucas Torreira and Cavani had the easy job of poking the ball over the line.</p>

      <p>Dybala had the ball in the net four minutes later but it was ruled out for a clear handball, and Messi ended the first period by forcing a save from Martin Campana before setting up Rodrigo De Paul who missed a golden chance.</p>
      <p>In a low-key start to the second half, Messi continued to pull his side's strings but there were few chances of note until just past the hour mark, when his free-kick found Aguero to equalise.</p>
      <p>Five minutes later Suarez netted to put Uruguay back in front, and despite Argentina's attacks through Dybala and Aguero, Oscar Tabarez's side looked set to hold firm.</p>
      <p>When Aguero headed over in the 90th minute it appeared Argentina's last chance had gone.</p>
      <p>But when the ball struck Caceres' arm in the fourth minute of added time, Messi took the chance to earn a draw.</p>
