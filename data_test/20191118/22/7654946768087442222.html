      <h1>Chirlane McCray recalls past depression battle: ‘I just wanted to die’</h1>

      <p>First Lady Chirlane McCray offered a gripping recounting of her own thoughts of suicide — fueled by constant racist bullying she endured as a child — as she kicked off her annual mental health conference Monday.</p>
      <p>McCray described to the audience the torment she endured as one of the only black children growing up in Longmeadow, Mass., in the 1960s — her classmates mocked for her skin color, teachers refused to have her in their classrooms, and construction workers spit at her as she rode her bike.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know how to handle all that,” she vividly recalled during her keynote at the Thrive conference at New York Law School Monday.</p>
      <p>“I was afraid, I was lonely, I was anxious and so often I just wanted to die,” she said — pausing before continuing her 15-minute address.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t until years later when I started working on my own mental health challenges, anxiety and substance misuse, that I realized my parents probably suffered too from untreated depression,” she said.</p>
      <p>It’s the first time McCray has publicly discussed how depression and vicious school-age bullying led her to consider suicide. She has previously discussed her marijuana use.</p>
      <p>The first lady received a standing ovation from the group of 140 attendees, including mayors, other elected leaders and behavioral health professionals at the event.</p>
      <p>The number attending the opening session of the two-day conference was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/just-seven-mayors-to-attend-chirlane-mccrays-annual-thrivenyc-conference/">much smaller than the 224 anticipated</a> by McCray’s staff.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said she anticipated more people to arrive as the conference continued.</p>
      <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio also addressed the gathering Monday afternoon and the pair will greet attendees during an evening reception at Gracie Mansion.</p>
      <p>McCray, who launched the city’s $1 billion mental health plan ThriveNYC, also acknowledged its shortcomings.</p>
      <p>The program <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/17/chirlane-mccrays-thrivenyc-fell-short-of-mental-health-goals-mayors-report/">has come under attack</a> by critics for its lack of metrics and for focusing on helping individuals with symptoms like those suffered by McCray.</p>
      <p>Just 12 percent of Thrive’s budget helps people with serious mental illness — like schizophrenia.</p>
      <p>“We still have an array, a fragmented array, of behavioral health services that let’s too may people feel through the cracks and we still don’t have a unified vision for how to achieve mental health for all,” McCray said in her opening remarks.</p>
