      <p>MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — Sindou Diallo scored 24 points and NAIA member Montana Tech shocked defending Big Sky Conference champion Montana 74-72 on Monday night.</p>
      <p>It was the first lost to a non-Division I team in 11 games under coach Travis DeCuire, their first since losing at D-II Alaska Anchorage early in the 2002-03 season and the first loss at home since the 1980-81 season.</p>
      <p>With just over a minute to play, Troy Owens Jr. hit a 3-pointer to pull the Orediggers, playing the game as an exhibition, with one. After a miss by the Grizzlies, Taylor England hit a long 2-pointer for a 73-72 lead with 24 seconds to go. The Grizzlies had a turnover, Montana Tech made one of two from the line with 7.9 seconds to go and Sayeed Pridgett’s shot at the buzzer went off the rim.</p>
      <p>Montana Tech won for the 12th time against 47 losses in a series that dates back to the 1907-08 season. The last win, following 12 losses, was in the 1947-48 season.</p>
      <p>Kendal Manuel scored 25 points for the Grizzlies (1-3). Pridgett and Kyle Owens both added 14 points.</p>
      <p>In the previous 10 wins over non-D-I schools under DeCuire, the Grizzlies averaged 76.6 points on offense and held opponents to 55.1 points.</p>
