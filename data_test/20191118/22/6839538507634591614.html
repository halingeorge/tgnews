      <p>A hazardous smoke haze blanketing Sydney has dragged our air quality well below that of world pollution capitals Beijing and Jakarta. Health authorities have a stern warning for asthma sufferers.</p>
      <p>Health authorities have urged asthma sufferers across Sydney to stay inside as a thick blanket of bushfire smoke settles across the region.</p>
      <p>Sydney’s air quality on Tuesday is among the lowest in the world – with NSW Environment’s air quality measurements reading 2334 at around 9am in Sydney’s North-West - almost 20 times worse than Jakarta and Beijing.</p>
      <p>The reading makes the city’s air quality the worst in the world and twice as bad as Kolkata’s which today sits at 999, according to the real-time Air Quality Index.</p>
      <p>With safe levels sitting at between 34-66, residents are being urged to take care.</p>

      <p>Jakarta’s notoriously polluted air today measures at 119 while Beijing’s measures at 155.</p>
      <p>The thick haze, blown in from a fire raging at Wollemi National Park, could be smelt and seen Sydney-wide on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Sydney’s east, northwest slopes and parts of the southwest are choking through hazardous levels while other parts of the state are struggling through very poor and poor ratings.</p>
      <p>The level of PM2.5 and PM10 particles sits at 2334 particulates per cubic metre of air in Sydney’s North-West, 540 in Sydney’s East and 641 in the Central Coast.</p>
      <p>The particles can trigger breathing problems in people with asthma, emphysema and angina.</p>

      <p>Those with respiratory or heart conditions are being urged to stay indoors with windows closed, use reliever medication where necessary, avoid vigorous exercise and cover their nose and mouth with a mask.</p>
      <p>Asthmatics aren’t the only ones to struggle through the haze, with the particles causing sore eyes, nose and throat for others.</p>
      <p>Symptoms can last for several days.</p>
      <p>Anyone with asthma or a lung condition who develops symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing is urged to follow their asthma action plan.</p>
      <p>Gabriele Branescu, duty forecaster at the Bureau of Metereology, says the haze will persist through to the afternoon when it should subside before picking up again on Wednesday.</p>
