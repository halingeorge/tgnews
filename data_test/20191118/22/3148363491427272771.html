      <p>Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/18/three-deaths-reported-after-shooting-at-oklahoma-walmart/">reported</a> that three deaths resulted from a shooting outside the Walmart around 10 a.m. Two individuals were fatally shot while sitting in a car, and a third person died outside the vehicle when police arrived.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7698537/Three-people-dead-shooting-Oklahoma-Walmart.html">reported</a> that the deceased individual outside the car was the gunman, and that he allegedly took his life after being confronted by an armed citizen.</p>
      <p>The gunman was wearing all black when he allegedly shot multiple rounds into a car where his estranged wife was sitting with her boyfriend, killing both. He was then “confronted by an armed citizen…[and] turned the gun on himself.”</p>
      <p>The Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/duncan-oklahoma-shooting-three-dead-after-shooting-at-a-walmart-authorities-say">reported</a> that witnesses indicated “the suspect shot the two people inside the car before an armed shopper approached with a gun—prompting him to shoot himself.”</p>
