      <h1>Selena Gomez Clarifies Her Bella Hadid 'That Sucks' Instagram Comment: ‚ÄòIt Was All a Misunderstanding‚Äô</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:13:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Selena Gomez set the record straight once and for all on her relationship with Bella Hadid: There is no behind-the-scene drama between them, despite social media speculation there could be because <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29819563/selena-gomez-bella-hadid-instagram-comment/">Hadid took down an Instagram Gomez commented</a> on this weekend.</p>
      <p>In reality, the entire thing was one big misunderstanding, Gomez clarified on fan account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/selssbrina/">Selssbrina's Instagram</a> this afternoon (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5BZYNcBiTb/">via TheSelenaRundown</a>). Hadid deserves no one's hate, and Gomez regrets posting her candid reaction without knowing the full situation.</p>
      <p>"I shouldn't of spoken without knowing the truth. I'm sorry," Gomez wrote. "Please don't be hurtful. She is a wonderful person, and it was all a misunderstanding."</p>

      <p>How did all this happen? Gomez originally commented "Stunning üòç" on a Dior photo that Hadid shared. Hadid took the photo down shortly after Gomez commented on it. Hadid and Gomez had public drama in 2017 when Gomez was dating Hadid's ex-boyfriend The Weeknd; the women <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a44029/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-unfollow-bella-hadid-on-instagram/">unfollowed each other on Instagram</a>, and fans (and media outlets) noticed.</p>
      <p>But Gomez and The Weeknd <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a12115489/selena-gomez-and-the-weeknd-relationship-timeline/">broke up</a> in October 2017. Two years out from the drama, Gomez refollowed Hadid on Instagram at the beginning of this month. <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29702891/selena-gomez-bella-hadid-instagram-refollowing/">People noticed</a>. This weekend's "stunning" comment was Gomez's continued show of goodwill to Hadid. (Hadid has also publicly supported Gomez,<a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a27471888/bella-hadid-likes-selena-gomez-cannes-photo/"> liking an Instagram of the singer in May</a>.)</p>
      <p>Fan account Selssbrina posted about Hadid deleting the post Gomez commented on. "That sucks üò¢," Gomez commented on that account. That comment took off, generating news coverage about Gomez's candid reaction. And so Gomez returned to the platform today to set the record straight: There is no feud or drama, just Gomez supporting a great woman.</p>
