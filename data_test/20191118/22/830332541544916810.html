      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A Texas industrial sand mining company's announcement that it has devalued two of its mines marks the bleak conditions facing Wisconsin's frack sand industry.</p>
      <p>Hi-Crush Inc. said last week that its August and Whitehall mines have been devalued by $109.7 million and $105.7 million each. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that this is in addition to a $131 million write-off for rail cars, terminals, other assets and goodwill.</p>
      <p>The August mine has been idle all year, and production has been cut back at the Whitehall plant.</p>
      <p>The company says the decision resulted from an oversupply of sand and a shift to locally produced sand in the highly productive oil fields of Texas and New Mexico.</p>
      <p>Brian Mayhew, professor of accounting at UW-Madison, says Hi-Crush recognizes the mines are not worth what they paid for them.</p>
