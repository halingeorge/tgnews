      <p>(CNN) - Former Vice President Joe Biden tops the Democratic primary field in the early voting state of South Carolina, according to new polls from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3649">Quinnipiac University</a> and the <a href="https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/porl/Final%20Press%20Nov%2018.pdf">University of North Florida</a>.</p>
      <p>About a third of likely voters in South Carolina plan to support the former vice president, according to both polls.</p>
      <p>Quinnipiac has Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders following him with 13% and 11%, respectively. In single digits are South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 6%, businessman Tom Steyer with 5%, businessman Andrew Yang with 4%, California Sen. Kamala Harris with 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker with 2%. No other candidate receives above 1% in Quinnipiac's poll.</p>
      <p>Steyer has now hit the polling threshold to qualify for the December debates, reaching above 4% in the Quinnipiac poll, his fourth. He still hasn't reached the fundraising threshold, so he isn't officially on the stage, with a few weeks left to qualify.</p>
      <p>The University of North Florida poll, which is not a qualifying poll for debates, found similar results for the top few candidates, with Warren and Sanders at 10% each and Steyer at 8%.</p>
      <p>Black voters who are likely to participate in the South Carolina primary strongly back Biden (44%) over other options (10% Steyer, 10% Warren, 8% Sanders, 4% Harris), according to the UNF poll.</p>
      <p>Likely voters in the Quinnipiac poll think the most important issue for basing their vote on in 2020 is health care (30%), followed by the economy (20%).</p>
      <p>The UNF poll finds that a majority of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina would prefer a candidate who would build on the Affordable Care Act (55%) than replace it with "Medicare for All" (39%).</p>
      <p>Voters would rather vote for someone who can beat President Donald Trump just slightly more than someone who represents their views -- 51% to 44%. About three-quarters say that they would vote for their least preferred Democratic candidate if they won the primary over Trump, while 11% said they wouldn't vote, and 7% would support Trump.</p>
      <p>The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted from November 13-17 among 768 likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.</p>
      <p>The Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida poll was conducted from November 5-13 among 436 likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of 4.7 percentage points.</p>
