      <p>Katherine McNamara, who plays an adult Mia Smoak, revealed her trip to Russia with her father will have a major impact on their relationship.</p>

      <p>"Well, if there’s anything we know about Mia, she thrives on a seedy environment — and Mia loves Russia," McNamara told <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/18/arrow-katherine-mcnamara-russia-season-8-episode-5-preview/">Entertainment Weekly</a>. "She takes to it like a fish to water. It’s fascinating to her.

      <p>McNamara also teased that the father/daughter team-up will also allow Mia to see her father in a new light.</p>
      <p>"That becomes a huge challenge for them, but it gives Mia an opportunity to understand her father a bit more and to really see the difficult choices that have been put in front of him his entire time being the Green Arrow," she added. "I think it allows her to come to terms a little bit more with the decisions that he’s made and with her blaming him for abandoning her, in a sense, to be this hero. She’s slowly starting to see his perspective a bit more, just as he’s starting to see hers. They bond in a sense because they start to realize how similar they are."</p>
