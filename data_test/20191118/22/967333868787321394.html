      <h1>Mr. Krabs’ Revenge: Dachshunds Dig Up Angry Crustacean</h1>
      <h2>August and Arlo, a pair of dachshunds from the land of Down Under, recently made a not-so-shocking discovery when their digging adventure at a Sunshine Coast beach led them to an angry crustacean.</h2>

      <p>Video filmed by beachgoer Jackson MacCue shows the tail-wagging doggos joyfully getting down and dirty in the sand - that is, until their digging skills bring them face-to-face with a certain crabby crab. Disaster strikes for the pair roughly seven seconds into the clip and sends one pooch running scared behind the other.</p>
      <p>Not the sort to stand down, though, both Arlo and August - after regaining their composure - sneak back toward the pincers-wielding crab. It’s unclear who won the beachy standoff, as the video abruptly cuts off as the pups are still mid-dance.</p>
