      <h1>The Mandalorian: Baby Yoda's Name Remains a Secret (For Now)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:11:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Johnson</a></address>
      <p>So, is that adorable infant introduced in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-mandalorian/"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a> a baby Yoda, or not? According to one of the Disney+ show's stars, that's going to remain a mystery for the time being.</p>
      <p>“You have to see the shows to figure out who this baby Yoda really is, and what he is all about, or even if he is really a baby Yoda,” said actor Carl Weathers. Weathers plays Greef Carga, head of the Bounty Hunters Guild who doles out assignments to The Mandalorian and other bounty hunters.</p>
      <p>“He has his own name, and he is very interesting and very knowledgeable and very cute,” Weathers added. “I never use that word, but he is a cute little guy.”</p>

      <p>If the infant character does indeed have his own name -- and not Yoda's -- it would align with the fact that the 900-year-old Yoda has already been dead for several years, relative to <i>The Mandalorian's</i> timeline. That's not to say the baby couldn't be a clone or have some other relationship to the legendary Jedi Master, however.</p>
      <p>Created by Jon Favreau, <i>The Mandalorian</i> stars Pedro Pascal, Gina Carano, Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Emily Swallow, Omid Abtahi, Werner Herzog and Nick Nolte. The first two episodes are streaming now on Disney+.</p>
