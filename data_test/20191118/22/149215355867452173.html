      <p>Pete Buttigieg is stuck on a polling rollercoaster.</p>
      <p>The South Bend, Indiana, mayor and 2020 candidate got good news over the weekend when a new <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879075/pete-buttigieg-leaps-16-points--into-lead--latest-iowa-poll">CNN/<i>Des Moines Register</i>/<i>Mediacom</i> poll</a> put him at the top of the Democratic field in Iowa. But his high hopes promptly sunk with a new <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3649">Quinnipiac University poll</a> out Monday that shows him floundering in South Carolina.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg racked up a respectable 6 percent support among likely voters in South Carolina, which will be the first southern state to hold a presidential primary next year. But when only black voters are taken into account, he earned the support of precisely 0 percent of them. Several other candidates also got negligible support among black voters, but Buttigieg has the highest percentage of white support in comparison and draws nearly all of his support from that demographic.</p>
      <p>That dismal showing might have something to do with how 60 percent of black respondents said they hadn't heard enough about Buttigieg to decide if they found him favorable or not. Still, that total puts him around the midpoint for recognizability among all the candidates, meaning things haven't looked this bad for Buttigieg since his followers <a href="https://twitter.com/LizMcLeod/status/1196141121660952576">learned how to dance</a>.</p>
      <p>Quinnipiac surveyed 768 likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters via landline and cell phone from Nov. 13–17, with a margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.</p>
