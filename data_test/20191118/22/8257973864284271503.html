      <h1>Dubai bar offering women free drinks based on their weight</h1>

      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- A Dubai bar is drawing in female customers with an unusual promotion -- the more they weigh, the more free drinks they receive.</p>
      <p>The Fusion Club at Cassells Al Barsha Hotel announced it will be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/a-dubai-bar-is-giving-women-free-drinks-based-on-their-weight-11175287/">running a special</a> through the end of the year offering $0.12 in free drink credit for every pound a female customer weighs -- meaning a woman weighing 150 pounds would receive about $18.50 worth of free drinks.</p>
      <p>Bar managers said there is a scale available in the bar, but customers can also use the honor system to merely tell their weight to bartenders.</p>
      <p>"Although we have a weighing machine at the bar entrance, we do not insist our guests to verify the weight," Anil Kumar, the hotel's food and beverage manager, <a href="https://www.insider.com/dubai-bar-offering-women-free-drinks-equal-to-their-weight-2019-11">told Insider.</a></p>
      <p>"We believe in the magnanimity of our lady guests," he said. "They can just write the weight on a paper and give it to the bartender discreetly, and enjoy drinks equal to the value they wrote on the paper. Very simple, no strings attached."</p>
      <p>The promotion's motto is, "It's good to gain weight."</p>
