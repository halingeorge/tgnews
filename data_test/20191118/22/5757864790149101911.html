      <p>If you think the sight of someone walking their sweater-clad dog is just about the cutest thing in the world, you’re absolutely correct. But what if that person was wearing a sweater that showed an image of their dog wearing a sweater? If you think that sounds even cuter, you’re in for a treat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://people.com/pets/custom-sweater-with-dog-in-sweater/">According to</a> <i>People</i>, New York-based apparel company <a href="https://www.sweaterhound.com/">Sweater Hound</a> will knit you a sweater that displays an image of your dog in a sweater—all you have to do is submit your favorite photo of your <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/564264/dogs-puppies-facts">dog</a>. And, because not all dogs love wearing sweaters in real life, your dog doesn’t have to be wearing a sweater in the photo you upload.</p>
      <p>Each <a href="https://www.sweaterhound.com/collections/sweaters/products/dog-wearing-sweater-sweater">sweater</a> is made from a combination of acrylic and recycled cotton, and will prove to your pet that you truly do love them more than anyone else (unless you already own sweaters emblazoned with the faces of your friends and family).</p>
      <p>The sweaters, which cost $98 each, come in both child and adult sizes, and you can choose between cream, navy, black, and gray. The options don’t stop there—Sweater Hound offers <a href="https://www.sweaterhound.com/collections/sweaters">sweaters</a> that show your dog wearing just a bow tie, a bow tie and a sweater, a Santa hat and scarf, reindeer ears and a sweater, or even a “Super Dog” cape and domino mask outfit.</p>

      <p>If sweaters aren’t really your style, there are also hoodies and sweatpants decorated with a smaller, logo-sized image of your dog. Or, you could snuggle with your prized pooch underneath a warm blanket bearing a rather giant image of said pooch.</p>

      <p>While the company does specialize in creating dog-related products, they’ll do their best to accommodate people who love salamanders in Santa hats, birds in bow ties, and other pets wearing clothes. You can email them at Hello@Sweaterhound.com to discuss your <a href="https://www.sweaterhound.com/pages/cats-other-furry-friends">options</a>.</p>
      <p>If you’re hoping to get someone a gift from Sweater Hound this holiday season, you should act fast: You have to place your <a href="https://www.sweaterhound.com/">order</a> by December 4 in order to guarantee delivery before Christmas, and that date will likely change as the days go by.</p>
