      <p>Despite being a beauty writer for more than five years, I never gave much thought to my foundation. My original philosophy was that if I was going to use concealer, contour, and add some blush, there’s no real point in overthinking what went underneath.</p>
      <p>Until I tried <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-le-teint-radiance-awakening-foundation-spf-22-P405083">YSL Beauty Touche Éclat Foundation</a>.</p>
      <p>If there’s one YSL beauty product that most people know about, it’s <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-radiance-perfecting-pen-P218431">the iconic Touche Eclat Highlighter Pen</a>. But for me, I’m a bigger fan of its <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-le-teint-radiance-awakening-foundation-spf-22-P405083">Touche Éclat Le Teint Radiance Awakening Foundation ($54)</a>.</p>
      <h3>My previous makeup routine involved five products to even out, define, and highlight my skin – now I just need one</h3>
      <p>Before I started using it more than four years ago, I viewed foundation simply as the base layer in my makeup routine. Concealer, bronzer, blush, and highlighter would come afterward and all this was just for my complexion; I haven’t even started on my brows, eyes, and lips.</p>
      <p>My makeup ritual was time-consuming and costly considering all the products I had to use, even for an “everyday” look. On top of all that, I was struggling to find a foundation that didn’t irritate my overly sensitive skin.</p>
      <p>After reading rave reviews about <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-le-teint-radiance-awakening-foundation-spf-22-P405083">YSL Touche Éclat Le Teint Radiance Awakening Foundation</a> online, I bit the bullet and finally tried it. Four years later, it’s still one of the best decisions I’ve made.</p>
      <p>I’ve managed to eliminate bronzer, blush, and highlighter from my daily routine, saving me a lot of money along the way and cutting my old routine in half. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-le-teint-radiance-awakening-foundation-spf-22-P405083">Touche Éclat Foundation</a> isn’t just another base for your skin, it’s also boosted my skin’s natural radiance and glow.</p>
      <h3>The formula includes plant extracts that help soothe skin, vitamin E to protect against free radicals, and SPF 22</h3>
      <p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-le-teint-radiance-awakening-foundation-spf-22-P405083">Touche Éclat Foundation</a> is infused with ruscus extract, a botanical ingredient that helps soothe, protect, and brighten skin while vitamin E nourishes and protects against free radicals. These are damaging factors on both a cellular and environmental level (like pollution) that can speed the aging process. The formula also includes SPF 22 for a little sun protection. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-le-teint-radiance-awakening-foundation-spf-22-P405083">Touche Éclat’s</a> ingredients work to improve my skin’s overall health while giving it just the right amount of coverage and glow.</p>
      <p>I originally thought that the skin-care-level ingredients would make <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-le-teint-radiance-awakening-foundation-spf-22-P405083">Touche Éclat</a> a light-coverage foundation, almost like a BB or CC cream; it’s actually the opposite. It provides medium coverage but I can build it up if I think my skin needs it. It helps even out discoloration, blemishes, and redness, but does it in a way that still manages to let my natural skin take center stage. In fact, my skin gets so many compliments and I know it’s really my skin’s health because I no longer have layers upon layers of makeup caked on my face.</p>
      <p>As far as my routine goes now, it only takes me about 15 minutes and six products to do my “everyday” makeup – including my brow shapers and lipstick. Obviously, special occasion makeup is a different story.</p>
      <p>My favorite part about <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=2417&amp;amp;u1=biipf_103119_ysl-beauty-touche-clat-foundation-product-review&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftouche-eclat-le-teint-radiance-awakening-foundation-spf-22-P405083">Touche Éclat Foundation</a> is that it’s long-lasting. So far, it’s survived four New York City summers – no other foundation has ever managed to achieve this. Even in the middle of August when humidity in New York is at its highest and I’m sweating just standing still, this foundation doesn’t melt off. It’s not billed as a sweat-proof formula, but it’s actually so long-wearing that it stays put through my 2-mile post-work runs. The only negative I have is the price tag. At $54 a bottle, it’s a pretty big investment.</p>
      <p>However, if I take into consideration that my skin’s health has improved and that I’ve saved a ton of time and money with this one base product, it’s not too shabby of a trade-off. It’s certainly something I’d want to spend more upfront knowing all the longterm benefits.</p>
