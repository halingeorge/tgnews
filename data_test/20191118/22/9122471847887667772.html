      <h1>The 7 Teams That Attended Colin Kaepernick’s Workout Have Been Identified</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:46:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>More than 24 NFL teams were reportedly planning on attending Colin Kaepernick’s workout at the Atlanta Falcons’ facility on Saturday afternoon. Kaepernick decided to move the workout to a high school 60 miles away, though, and that number decreased by quite a bit.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, who’s been out of the league for three seasons, ended up working out in front of a lot of media and fans.</p>
      <p>According to the NFL wire, seven teams attended:</p>
      <blockquote>Detroit, Kansas City, New York Jets, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Tennessee, Washington.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier reports suggested Buffalo was in attendance, though the Bills refuted that.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick made a brief statement following his workout.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready. I’m staying ready. And I’ll continue to be ready. To all the people that came out today to support, I appreciate y’all, I love y’all. To the people that aren’t here, I’m thinking of you, I appreciate you supporting from where you are. We’ll continue to give you updates as we hear. We’ll be waiting to hear from Roger Goodell, the NFL, 32 teams. We’ll let you know if we hear from them. The ball’s in their court. We’re ready to go,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>If an NFL team is serious about signing Kaepernick, they’ll probably bring him in for a private workout. Nothing regarding that has surfaced in the wake of Saturday’s performance, though.</p>
