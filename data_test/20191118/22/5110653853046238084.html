      <h1>DraftKings Picks Week 12: NFL DFS lineup advice for daily fantasy football cash games</h1>

      <p>Our Week 12 DraftKings cash lineup willcapitalize on some offenses that have become quietly competent, or at least ones that have flown under the radar enough to avoid aggressive price adjustments on NFL DFS sites.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/draftkings-picks-week-11-nfl-dfs-lineup-advice-cash-games-daily-fantasy-football-sleepers-values/12p7o6k2owi9p14fetepe3xkve">Last Sunday's main slate attack</a> focused on mid-tier receivers with target floor and receiving upside, which got us across the finish line thanks to John Brown and Calvin Ridley. We also ran with the pack on D.J.Moore and made out fine there.</p>

      <p>We now get a slate that features teams in the midst of disappointingseasons that have started to inspire confidence from a fantasy perspective, at least in certain spots.</p>
      <h3>DraftKings Week 12 Picks: NFL DFS cash lineup</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Playing under a $50K salary cap for Sunday afternoon ET contests.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>QB Sam Darnold, Jets vs. Raiders ($5,800). </b>The Raiders defense faredbetter recently againstPhilip Riversand Ryan Finley. However, this unit still allows the sixth-most DK points to quarterbacks and visits Sam Darnold, who's coming off consecutive 20-plus-point weeks.</p>
      <p><b>RB Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers ($8,200). </b>Kamara leads all running backs in receptions since coming off bye and injury leave two weeks ago. Pricing for 2018 Kamara would get him easily to $10K, Christian McCaffrey range, and I like his chance of getting to 4X value and 25 DK points more than CMC hitting 4X value this week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/1x0x7s3rojv001j4w68nm8zos7">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1o9fjg2z6mzra1nyyh9xc82iar">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1w752s5mgwmem1ie8oz1iw01e9">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RB Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Steelers ($5,900). </b>Mixon hit 3X value for me last week and gets priced up a modest $400 on a trip home to face Cincinnati's big bro from Pittsburgh. This is still a slow adjustment from DraftKings given that Mixon ranks fourth in the league in touchessince Zac Taylor put in his rookie QB.</p>
      <p><b>WR DJ Chark Jr., Jaguars @ Titans ($6,400). </b>Mid-tier price for a player Nick Foles see as the alpha in this offense. In the Jags starting quarterback'sfirst week back, Chark led the league in both targets and air yards, smashing with104 yards and two scores on eight catches.</p>
      <p><b>WR Jarvis Landry, Browns vs. Dolphins ($6,300). </b>There are some grossly underpriced receiversin offenses that have become competent. Only two players have seen more targets over the past four weeks than Landry, so we like him to pay off in this "revenge" spot.</p>
      <p><b>WR Michael Gallup, Cowboys @ Patriots ($5,900). </b>Gallup ranks fifth among receivers in targets since Week 9, knotting him with teammate Amari Cooper for a 23-percenttargetmarket share. Assuming Stephon Gilmore gets Amari Cooper and Jason McCourty gets Gallup, I prefer the (healthier) latter at lowercost.</p>
      <p><b>TE Ryan Griffin, Jets vs. Raiders ($4,200). </b>Griffin gets to build on his 25-DK-pointweek with a price that doesn't really factor his usage sans Chris Herndon, who is now on IR. When you remove the Week 10 outing where Chris Herndon factored more heavily, Griffin ranks fifth in TE targets since Week 8.</p>
      <p><b>FLEX DeVante Parker, Dolphins @ Browns ($5,200). </b>Share No. 2 in Fins-Browns! Let's go!Parker has seen 20 targets in the two weeks since Preston Williams went on IR, commanding a 26-percenttarget and 43-percentair yards market share from Ryan Fitzpatrick.</p>
      <p><b>DST Bengals vs. Steelers ($2,100).</b> The path to sevenDK p oints is paved with quarterbacks making mistakes.We get basement price to exploit Mason Rudolph, <a href="https://premium.pff.com/nfl/positions/passing/summary?position=QB&amp;season=2019&amp;week=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17">PFF</a>'s lowest-graded quarterback among 31 with 250 or more attempts this season.</p>
