      <p>CHICAGO - Every day, News 3 Now works to serve the people of southern Wisconsin. </p>
      <p>Our news team was honored with an Emmy Award on Saturday, through the <a href="https://chicagoemmyonline.org/">Chicago/Midwest chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.</a></p>
      <p>Our team was recognized for our news coverage of the <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/weather/record-breaking-flooding-hits-west-madison-areas-west-of-city/784183916">historic flooding our area saw in August 2018.</a></p>

      <p>It <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/bridges-damaged-in-black-earth-flooding-must-be-replaced/787059900">washed away roads</a> and bridges, <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/madison-s-tenney-dam-to-release-more-water-or-risk-devastating-flooding-along-the-yahara-river-/785267472">destroyed homes</a> and <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/photos-shoe-box-in-black-earth-drying-out-after-flooding/784241811">damaged businesses.</a></p>
