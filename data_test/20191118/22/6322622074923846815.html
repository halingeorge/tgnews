      <p>(Nov 19): Asian stocks looked set for a muted open as investors continued to look for signs of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations. The dollar and Treasury yields retreated.</p>
      <p>Futures in Japan and Australia were little changed with Hong Kong contracts slipping after escalating violence in the city Monday. On Wall Street, stocks fluctuated throughout the day, but ended up eking out gains. The dollar extended a slide after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell met with President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday to discuss the economy. Topics discussed included dollar strength and negative rates.</p>
      <p>Markets around the world are in a holding pattern, sensitive to any developments on trade after months of closely followed negotiations. Word that White House would extend a license to allow U.S. companies to do business with Chinese telecom firm Huawei competed with reports that said Beijing was skeptical about reaching a broad deal anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the British pound climbed following a series of opinion polls that showed U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s party well ahead of the opposition. Oil fell the most in about two weeks from an eight-week high.</p>
