      <p><b>DUNCAN, OklahomaÂ (AP)</b> - Two men and a woman were fatally shot Monday morning outside a Walmart store in southwestern Oklahoma, and the shooter is among the dead, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Two victims were shot inside a car and the third was died in the parking lot just before 10 a.m. outside the store in Duncan, Police Chief Danny Ford said.</p>
      <p>Authorities did not immediately describe a motivation for the shooting. Ford said at a news conference that it appears a gunman shot the male and female victims and then turned the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks authorities said during the news conference Monday afternoon that there was never an active shooter inside the store and he described the shooting as an isolated incident. He did not further explain.</p>
      <p>Two bodies covered with sheets were visible in the parking lot Monday afternoon. One body was in the driver's seat of a red, two-door car. The other body was lying on the ground next to the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Bullet holes were visible in the car's windshield. Police said in a Facebook post that a handgun was found at the scene. At the news conference, Ford described the gun as semi-automatic but said he had no further details. He said the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation was still processing the scene.</p>
      <p>Ford said he believed nine shots were fired.</p>
      <p>Authorities have not released the identities of those killed but did confirm the shooter was among the dead. Ford said all three knew each other but declined to describe their relationships or other identifying information pending notification of immediate family.</p>
      <p>He said all three were dead when police arrived at the scene just minutes after the shooting.</p>
      <p>Duncan is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City. The Walmart is in a commercial center that includes a sporting goods store and a dollar store along U.S. Highway 81, the main road that passes through Duncan heading south toward Texas.</p>
      <p>Aaron Helton, of Duncan, said he was parking outside the Walmart where he planned to buy groceries when he heard about nine gunshots.</p>
      <p>"I arrived and there were three bodies," Helton said.</p>
      <p>Walmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins said in an email that no staff members were involved in the shooting and that the store was not evacuated. Ford told The Associated Press that based on the social media posts of the woman who was killed, he believed she may have been a Walmart employee at some time.</p>
      <p>It was at least the third shooting at a Walmart in the U.S. this year. A Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, reopened Thursday after being closed since August, when a gunman opened fire in the busy store, killing 22. Just days before, two Walmart employees in Mississippi were killed by a man authorities described as a disgruntled Walmart worker.</p>
      <p>The killings in Oklahoma come amid a spate of high-profile shootings across the U.S. A 16-year-old student at a high school in the city of Santa Clarita outside Los Angeles shot and killed two classmates and wounded three other teens Thursday before shooting himself in the head. He died the next day.</p>
      <p>In New Jersey, players and spectators ran for cover Friday night when a gunman opened fire at a high school football game, wounding two people. And on Sunday, four people were killed and six wounded in Fresno, California, where police say two shooters sneaked into a backyard party and shot into a group of Hmong family and friends</p>
