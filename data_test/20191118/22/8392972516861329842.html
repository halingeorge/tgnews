      <h1>I'm A Celebrity viewers in awe of Caitlyn Jenner as campmates take first jungle showers</h1>
      <h2>Hunky James Haskell also stripped off for a wash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:08:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:08</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>Fans of Caitlyn Jenner were bursting with pride this evening as the 70-year-old ex Olympian stripped down for a jungle shower on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn and rugby hunk James Haskell became the first campmates to flash some flesh this series as they got down to their smalls to keep clean.</p>
      <p>The pumping efforts of Adele Roberts and Nadine Coyle meant the water was available to go in the campsite.</p>
      <p>And Kate Garraway was among the other stars to lend a helping hand and pour the water from above the heads of Caitlyn and James.</p>

      <p>But the sudden gushes of water seemed to take Caitlyn by surprise, leaving her spluttering.</p>
      <p>James, however, seemed less surprised by the spurting water and managed to lather up without any difficulty.</p>
      <p>And even though dozens of viewers expressed admiration on Twitter for James' physique, it was Caitlyn's moment under the makeshift waterfall that stole the attention.</p>
      <p>Disappointingly, negative comments surrounding her gender transition were all over Twitter.</p>

      <p>However, there were also many positive remarks from those watching who found her bravery inspirational.</p>
      <p>"Seeing caitlyn jenner, a 70 year-old transgender woman, having a shower in a bikini on mainstream TV honestly is so important and amazing🥰 #ImACeleb," tweeted one person.</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Say what you want about Caitlyn Jenner but not many people would be brave enough to go on tv in a bikini in the shower after all the criticism and judgement she gets! 👏🏼 #ImACeleb #imacelebrity."</p>

      <p>"Caitlyn almost drowning in the shower is a big mood #imaceleb," joked another person.</p>
      <p>And yet another praised her: "Hats off to caitlyn jenner, I’m sorry but she’s a transgender woman, she is 70 years old, she jumped out of a plane at 70 YEARS OLD and now she’s brave enough to shower in front of the world when she knows exactly what people will be thinking and saying👏🏼👏🏼 #ImACeleb."</p>
