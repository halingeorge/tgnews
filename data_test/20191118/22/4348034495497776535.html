      <p>An affiliate of Smif-N-Wessun’s Tek, Brooklyn, New York’s Rome Streetz is one of the MCs buzzing in the current Big Apple underground. Over the years, he’s put in work with the likes of Snowgoons, Agallah (fka 8-Off), and 38 Spesh. In 2019, he has released several projects, including <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0CRVHGPg72wkLeaMKrzYTo?si=H0eRCSoSQDCmqIjJmz-oLw"><i>Headcrack</i></a>, with producer Futurewave. More recently, Streetz unleashed the third installment of his <i>Noise Kandy</i> series, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6ctvH6ATLSBDYr9GDn14y2?si=8GJyjI8jTVm49Uqtck967w"><i>The Overdose</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The LP includes production by Statik Selektah, sadhugold, and Dirty Diggs, among others, as well as a featured verse from Planet Asia. It concludes with “96 Nauti Windbreaker Sh*t.” Produced by fellow BK representative JR Swiftz (Westside Gunn, Flee Lord), the sparse two-minute display comes to a video. Like his raps, the visual is grim. It shows the unchanged parts of the city, from the avenue to the Hudson River. Wearing the title Nautica garment, Rome raps about revenge, transitioning from the street game to the Rap game, and trying to come up in a rugged world.</p>

      <p>“<i>Life of a rolling stone / It’s ’96 Nauti windbreaker sh*t / Livin’ dangerous / Leavin’ all my opps’ faces with razor rips / Peep these ni**as bitin’ my style, they all plagiarists / The b*tches scream ‘turn that sh*t off’ when I played your sh*t,</i>” he charges.</p>
      <p><b>#BonusBeat:</b> Recently, Rome spoke to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-455642906/tracks">the <i>Crush-A-Lot Podcast</i></a> about making this album. He detailed recording<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X4qyseVcWk"> “World In My Palm”</a> before Joey Bada$$ and Pro Era, and how supportive Statik Selektah has been of his talent. Streetz also credits Roc Marciano as an architect to a style of Rap that is getting due recognition:</p>
