      <p>A Dutch court sentenced a Pakistani man to 10 years behind bars on Monday for planning to assassinate anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders after the MP announced a cartoon competition depicting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
      <p>The man, identified as Junaid I. by local media, was arrested in August 2018 at a train station in The Hague after he posted a film on Facebook in which he said he wanted to “send Wilders to hell” and urged others to help.</p>
      <p>Judges at The Hague's district court found the 27-year-old man, who had travelled from France, guilty of “planning a murder with a terrorist motive” and “incitement to commit a terrorist deed”.</p>
      <p>“The suspect more than once said that Wilders' death would be a good deed,” said presiding judge Jan van Steen, who added four years in jail to the six years sought by the prosecution.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, the suspect wanted to commit the murder in one of the parliamentary buildings, the heart of Dutch democracy,” Van Steen said. The suspect had denied any terror-related motives.</p>
      <p>He said during the trial that he was “peace-loving” and had only travelled to the Netherlands from France to protest against Wilders' cartoon competition.</p>
      <p>The Facebook video was seen by more than 153,000 people and shared 14,000 times.</p>
      <p>Far-right leader Wilders <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1429927/dutch-anti-islam-lawmaker-cancels-blasphemous-caricatures-contest">cancelled</a> his plans two days later to stage the cartoon competition, a move that angered many Muslims, particularly in Pakistan where widespread protests were held.</p>
      <p>Wilders, 56, known for his peroxide bouffant hairdo and firebrand anti-immigration and anti-Islamist statements, lives in a safe house and has been granted 24-hour protection by the Dutch state.</p>
      <p>The court did not say how Junaid I. planned to kill Wilders but found that in a bugged phone call after his arrest he said he took “specific things with him [...] without which his mission would not be complete”. He had also walked around with a “large backpack, which he did not have when he was arrested” and lied about what it contained, the judges said.</p>
