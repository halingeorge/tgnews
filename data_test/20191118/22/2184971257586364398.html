      <p><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/boris-johnson/"><b>Boris Johnson</b></a> has written to <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/jeremy-corbyn/"><b>Jeremy Corbyn</b></a> ahead of Tuesday's head-to-head televised debate with a series of questions he claims the Labour leader has "ducked" during the campaign.</p>
      <p>The prime minister requested his opponent deliver answers "at or ahead of the debate", which will be broadcast live at 8pm on ITV, to the following four questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are proposing a second referendum on EU membership. In that referendum, would you recommend the UK should remain or leave?</li>
        <li>Would you end, maintain or extend free movement, and would immigration be higher or lower under Corbyn's Labour?</li>
        <li>How much would you be willing to pay into the EU budget in return for "access to markets"?</li>
        <li>Can you guarantee that every Labour candidate supports your Brexit policy?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The letter, dated 18 November, echoed many of the messages delivered by Mr Johnson on the campaign trail, ending with a warning of "dither, delay and uncertainty" should Labour gain power.</p>
