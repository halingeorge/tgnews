      <h1>Trevor Lawrence Reacts To The Injury To Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:35:06+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa won’t play another down of football this season. The Alabama star quarterback suffered a season-ending injury against the Mississippi State Bulldogs this past Saturday.</p>
      <p>The college football world is coming together to support Tagovailoa during this ordeal. Former and current players and coaches are voicing their support for the star quarterback. Tagovailoa is clearly an iconic figure in the sports world.</p>
      <p>Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence is the latest to discuss Tagovailoa’s injury. He spoke to the media and gave his reaction to the injury on Monday. He says he sent Tagovailoa a text message over the weekend, wishing him well.</p>
      <blockquote>“I just hate it for him,” Lawrence said, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Trevor-Lawrence-sent-Tagovailoa-supportive-message-after-injury-138827008/">247Sports</a>. “He’s a really good guy. I know the competitor he is and it just sucks not being able to finish the year. I think the biggest thing from it is to just enjoy every moment because you never know what’s going to happen.”</blockquote>
      <p>Wise words from a young, elite quarterback. Lawrence clearly feels sorry for Tagovailoa and Alabama.</p>
      <p>Clemson and Alabama met in last year’s national championship game. It was a coming-out party for Lawrence, who led the Tigers to a 44-16 blowout victory over Tagovailoa and the Crimson Tide.</p>
      <p>The two players clearly share no hard feelings despite playing against each other last season.</p>
      <p>Let’s hope Tagovailoa can have a full, speedy recovery.</p>
