      <p>Google just released Google Chrome 78.0.3904.108 and with it is the return of the 'Close other tabs' feature that Google mistakenly took out in previous versions.</p>
      <p>With the release of Chrome 78, Google removed the 'New tab', 'Close other tabs', 'Reopen closed tab', and 'Bookmark all tabs' context-menu options as they stated these functions could be performed with other methods or were not used enough.</p>

      <p>For people, like myself, who used 'Close other tabs' throughout the day, Google recommended that users drag the tab they want to keep over to the first tab and then right-click on it and select 'Close tabs to the right'.</p>
      <p>I have to say, after using this method for a few weeks, their suggested method is just annoying and makes Chrome less usable rather than better.</p>
      <p>The good news is that 'Close other tabs' is now back in the latest version of Chrome 78 released today.</p>

      <p>Google, now that it's back, don't touch it again!</p>
