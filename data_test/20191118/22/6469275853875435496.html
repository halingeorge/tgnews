        <b>Preston North End pair Alan Browne and Sean Maguire both featured in the Republic of Ireland's 1-1 draw with Denmark at the Aviva Stadium on Monday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The result meant the Irish fell short in their bid to qualify automatically for Euro 2020 and they will have to negotiate a play-off in March.</p>
      <p>Browne was named in the starting XI after impressing Mick McCarthy in last week's friendly against New Zealand.</p>
      <p>He played the full game, while Maguire joined the action from the bench in the 82nd minute.</p>
      <p>Martin Braithwaite gave Denmark the lead in the 73rd minute, Wolves' Matt Doherty equalising five minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Despite late pressure, McCarthy's side couldn't find the second goal needed to send them to the Euros automatically.</p>
