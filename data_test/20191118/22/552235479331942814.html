      <h1>Steve Clarke wants Scotland to forget 'revenge' and focus on third place finish</h1>
      <h2>The Scotland manager wants the focus to be firmly placed on building morale ahead of March play-offs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:29:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Steve Clarke insists Scotland’s crack at Kazakhstan is a play-off dress rehearsal rather than a revenge mission.</p>
      <p>The national side suffered a humiliating 3-0 defeat in Nur-Sultan in March that ended automatic qualification hopes for Euro 2020 and cost <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alex-mcleish">Alex McLeish</a> his job.</p>
      <p>The Kazakhs are in Glasgow for the return clash tomorrow night but the manager is not interested in avenging the loss.</p>
      <p>Clarke’s focus is on rebuilding Scotland’s shattered morale and finishing a woeful Group I campaign with a flourish following wins against San Marino and Cyprus.</p>
      <p>The Nations League play-offs are up in March and the gaffer said: “I’m not one for revenge. It’s important because we want to finish third.</p>

      <p>“That’s an opportunity for us to finalise that.</p>
      <p>“We want to go into the play-off game on the back of three wins and it’s a chance to do that.</p>
      <p>“We want that feelgood factor we’ve all talked about for months and months.</p>
      <p>“Slowly it’s starting to come back so we want to continue that.”</p>
      <p>Clarke is hoping the Tartan Army is on board tomorrow evening on the back of the hard-fought win in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Ryan Christie and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> did the damage in Nicosia but there were still some defensive alarm bells with the makeshift backline.</p>
      <p>But Clarke said: “The pitch wasn’t great, it was very sticky. But a few times we lost the ball in dangerous areas and they picked us off. So we have to get the balance right between being really good going forward – which we are – and a bit more cautious and safe at the back.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The fans will have gone home from Cyprus pleased.</p>
      <p>“They’ll analyse the performance differently to how we will but it’s a win. It will be nice to see a few of them back at Hampden on Tuesday.”</p>
      <p>Clarke has struggled to get his strongest side out since taking charge in May – and this week was robbed of star turns such as Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-mctominay">Scott McTominay</a> and Ryan Fraser.</p>
      <p>But he insisted he DOES know his favoured starting XI – even if he might never get the chance to see it.</p>
      <p>Clarke was satisfied with what he saw in Cyprus though and said: “If everybody was fit and available I’d have a good idea.</p>
      <p>“But I felt the team had a good balance in Cyprus.”</p>
      <p>Clarke is hoping <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-naismith">Steven Naismith</a> will be available after limping off after a hour in Cyprus –and Kenny McLean could also come in to consideration.</p>
      <p>But the manager might be reluctant to change too much after seeing some of his new faces impress in Nicosia, including full back Liam Palmer who banished the demons of his nightmare international debut in Kazakhstan.</p>

      <p>Clarke said: “I noticed nobody has really talked about Liam. I remember Liam, when he went to Kazakhstan, was roundly criticised.</p>
      <p>“Unfairly. It was his first cap and a really difficult night.</p>
      <p>“But since then he’s done well for us.</p>
      <p>“He did well in Russia, did well at home to San Marino and I thought he was excellent in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>“So I’d like to give him a mention.</p>
      <p>“Right back has been a problem position for us but I trust Stephen O’Donnell because I know him inside out having worked with him at club level.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But Liam got the chance to go into the team and he deserves to stay there given his performances. It’s not for any other reason. I think he’s doing really well for us.”</p>
      <p>“Kenny picked up a knock with his club but we didn’t pull him out of the squad because we had enough withdrawals.</p>
      <p>“Kenny now has an outside chance of being available for the game on Tuesday. We’ll assess what we have injury wise and if we feel we need to pull Kenny back into the squad I think we can do that.</p>
      <p>“We’ll get back and have a little look.</p>
      <p>“Some continuity is normal but in the last few games I’ve made four or five changes for both matches. Right now I’m not envisaging I’ll make that many this time.”</p>
