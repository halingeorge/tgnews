      <p>Reports of Shah Rukh Khan collaborating with south filmmaker Atlee Kumar have been circulating recently. The film is said to be titled ‘Sanki’ and now according to a report by <i>Times of India</i>, the movie will go on the floors in March next year.</p>
      <p>At an event, Kumar was asked about working with Khan and he replied, “I have a huge amount of love and respect for #SRK sir and he also loves my work. Soon, hopefully, we will do something about it.”</p>
      <p>Khan and Kumar’s apparent film is said to be an original one and will not be a remake of Atlee’s earlier films ‘Mersal’ (2017) or ‘Theri’ (2016), reports <i>Pinkvilla</i>. Whilst an official announcement is yet to be made, Khan had previously said that he is working on a lot of scripts and is yet to finalise his next move. Khan also assured fans that he will make the big announcement within a few months.</p>
