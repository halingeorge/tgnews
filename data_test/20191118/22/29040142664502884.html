      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Disney+ has launched in the U.S., The Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The next batch of launch countries we know of involves France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. on March 31, 2020, but Disney+ is projected to launch in most markets over the next two years.</p>
      <p>International movie magic: <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU80140YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=f04_Aley">Disney+</a> ($7/month at Disney+)</p>
      <h3>Where you can get Disney+ right now</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Netherlands</li>
        <li>U.S.</li>
        <li>Canada</li>
        <li>Australia</li>
        <li>New Zealand</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the Netherlands were the lucky dutch-speaking ducks that got to try Disney+ during the public beta, the service is now out and availble in five countries, and that's where the availability list will be sitting for the next few months.</p>
      <h3>What about the rest of the world?</h3>

      <p>The next concrete launch date we have right now is <b>March 31, 2020 for France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.</b>. Disney's announcement video <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1192557075651383296">and tweet</a> stated that these are not the only countries getting the Disney+ magic that day, but they are the only ones we know of at this time. As for the rest of the world, the tentative global rollout timeline Disney shared originally is as follows, though it is obviously subject to change.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Western Europe in the first half of 2020</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Eastern Europe in the first half of 2021</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Latin America in the first half of 2021</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Asia and Pacific country launches throughout 2020 and 2021</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The difference in media laws — and pre-existing content exclusivity agreements in many countries — also means that when Disney+ arrives in your country, it may not have all of the same content it does in the launch countries. For instance, French law forbids theatrically-released films from being put on a streaming service in that country for three years, so even though France gets Disney+ in March, don't expect to see Endgame there until at least 2021.</p>
      <h3>What if I can't wait that long?</h3>
      <p>You'll have to jump through a few hoops — setting up a U.S. Apple or Google Play account for billing, for instance — but <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpns-work-disney-plus">using a VPN</a> you can pretend you live in the United States and subscribe to Disney+.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that using a VPN to get service means you'll need to use a VPN or DNS service on every single device you try to watch Disney+ on, and even then you can sometimes run into location errors. If you really can't wait for it to launch in your country, though, signing up via VPN is a damn sight better than torrenting the shows instead.</p>
