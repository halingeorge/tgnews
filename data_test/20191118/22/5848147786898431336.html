        <b>WARNING: <i>THE CROWN</i> SEASON 3 SPOILERS AHEAD</b>
      </p>
      <p>Season 3 of Netflix’s <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/tv/2019/10/22/crown-season-three-trailer/"><i>The Crown</i></a> opens with the Queen noisily spooning marmalade onto her breakfast toast while Prince Philip watches news on TV.</p>
      <p>It’s general election day in 1964 and Philip (Tobias Menzies) tells his wife a “friend at the lunch club” claims the likely new prime minister, Harold Wilson, is said to be a KGB mole.</p>
      <p>“That’s ridiculous,” says the Queen (Olivia Colman.)</p>

      <p>She was right.</p>
      <p>The scuttlebutt about Wilson turned out to be false but <i>The Crown’s</i> storyline that the Queen knew about a mole within the walls of Buckingham Palace itself is true.</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Blunt">Sir Anthony Blunt</a> was surveyor of the Queen’s art, and according to the 10-part TV hit, was well acquainted enough with the monarch to chat with her about paintings when they met in palace corridors.</p>

      <p>The historian turned out to be part of infamous spy ring the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-28143770">Cambridge Five</a>.</p>
      <p>Blunt was recruited by the Soviets in the 1930s before working for MI5 during World War II.</p>
      <p>He was unmasked, in real life and in <i>The Crown</i>, when American authorities tipped off Britain, Blunt confessed and the news was broken to an appalled Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>The twist is that for his confession Blunt received full immunity from prosecution and the government agreed to keep his spying career an official secret for 15 years.</p>

      <p>A signature of <i>The Crown</i> is it dazzlingly weaves the Windsors’ personal goings on – Princess Anne’s dalliance with Andrew Parker Bowles, Prince Charles’ theatrical aspirations – with events unfolding around them including the <i>Apollo 11</i> Moon landing.</p>
      <p>When Helena Bonham Carter signed to play Princess Margaret, she was sent a document outlining the historical events the season will cover.</p>
      <p>“We get briefed on all the facts and then we’re told maybe they fudged an event for dramatic purposes,” she told <i>The Hollywood Reporter.</i></p>
      <p>“It can’t be that inaccurate, but no one was taping these conversations. It’s not documented. It’s not a documentary.”</p>

      <p>The third episode sees the Queen’s grief over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberfan_disaster">1966 disaster in the Welsh mining village of Aberfan</a>, when a mountain of waste removed from a mine collapsed.</p>
      <p>A total of 144 people, including 116 children, were buried alive.</p>
      <p>Fans hailed <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/crown-reveals-how-aberfan-mining-tragedy-impacted-monarchy-1254905"><i>The Crown’s</i> depiction of the dreadful story</a> as “utterly heartbreaking” and Colman as an “absolute legend”.</p>
      <p>Less harrowing is the show’s glitzy portrayal in episode two of Princess Margaret’s 1965 tour of the US with photographer husband Lord Snowdon.</p>

      <p>The pair were guests of honour at a <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a29689549/princess-margaret-lyndon-b-johnson-meeting-the-crown/">White House black tie dinner</a> hosted by president Lyndon  B Johnson and first lady Claudia ‘Lady Bird’ Johnson, and attended by 150 notables including actor Kirk Douglas.</p>
      <p><i>The Crown’s</i> depiction of the dinner – screened 54 years to the day after the event – shows Margaret (Bonham Carter) instructed by her sister to charm the president and secure a financial assistance package for Britain.</p>
      <p>Cue Margaret making indiscreet comments about late president John F Kennedy, suggesting a drinking contest (“last man standing is the winner”) and singing with a bedazzled Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p>The new BFFs are also shown holding a limerick-off, during which Margaret, her husband (Ben Daniels) and the president recite ribald rhymes.</p>
      <p>So, did it actually happen?</p>

      <p>With Kennedy family members including matriarch Rose present, the princess – a life-long diplomat despite her wild reputation – is not likely to have whaled on JFK publicly.</p>
      <p>But <i>The New York Times</i> reported that “The party lasted longer than most White House affairs”, with Margaret and her husband staying until 1.35am.</p>
