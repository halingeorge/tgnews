        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lisa-fowler/">Lisa Fowler</a>’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lucy-benjamin/">Lucy Benjamin</a>) accusations against Sharon (Letitia Dean) regarding the death of Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) lead to a dramatic series of fallouts in EastEnders, leaving Louise (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tilly-keeper/">Tilly Keeper</a>) fearing that her fragile mum is suffering from another breakdown.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having previously suffered from psychosis, Lisa was sectioned some time ago after taking Louise captive while she was injured from a fire at the prom. Since then, Lisa has had her demons under control but after Mel was killed following a road accident, Lisa accused Sharon of killing her.</p>
      <p>Viewers saw Mel cross the road to her crashed car after hearing Hunter call to her and in the chaos, she was hit by a lorry before Sharon’s eyes. Lisa knows that Mel was about to blow the secret to Phil (Steve McFadden) that Sharon’s baby isn’t his. Believing that Sharon took murderous steps to silence her, Lisa told Phil what she knew and went on to brandish Sharon a murderer.</p>

      <p>Her hysterical claims didn’t wash with Phil as Sharon managed to keep a lid on the truth coming to light about her fling with Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) and, as Lisa displayed erratic behaviour, Phil cornered her and warned her to stop spreading her lies – or he would kill her.</p>
      <p>As Lisa remains determined to get to the truth, convinced that Sharon had a hand in Mel’s death, Louise becomes traumatised by recent events and fears that Lisa will be taken away again. As she seeks comfort in Sharon, she admits that she fears the worst and doesn’t know what is happening to her mum.</p>
      <p>With no-one believing her, will Sharon stand by and allow Lisa’s health to be shattered just to protect her own damaging secret? Or will she make an admission to Louise?</p>
