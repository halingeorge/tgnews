      <h1>YoungBoy Never Broke Again’s Mother Claims He Kicked Her Out of the House He Bought Her</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:15:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/trentfitzgerald/" target="_blank">Trent Fitzgerald</a></address>
      <p>It looks like there's some serious drama going on in <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/youngboy-never-broke-again/">YoungBoy Never Broke Again</a>'s family.</p>
      <p>During an Instagram Live session that surfaced online on Monday (Nov. 18), YoungBoy’s mother, Sherhonda, claimed the rapper kicked her out of the house he bought for her. Apparently, the two had a heated argument, which led to YoungBoy’s mother being thrown out of the home.</p>
      <p>“I’m not finna to let you play with me,” she said. “Kentrell (the rapper’s real name) got me a fucking house. He get you house and if you do what he fucking says, he get it took.”</p>
      <p>Sherhonda then adds, “I don’t give a fuck, you can have your house. I’ll sleep under the interstate. Bitch I’ll sleep on a muthafuckin' park bench. You will not hold your money over my muthafuckin' head, I don’t give a fuck.”</p>
      <p>This scenario feels similar to the moment Blueface kicked his mother and sister out of his house back in June. At the time, Blue kicked <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/07/blueface-mother-sister-girlfriend-house/">his mother, Karlissa, and his sister, Kali, out of his California home</a> while on IG Live. In the video, Blueface and Kali are engaged in a verbal argument while their mother records it. After bickering for a few minutes, Blueface then picks up his mother's clothes and throws them out the door. Afterward, the "Thotiana" rapper called his mother a clout-chaser.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, YoungBoy, who just dropped his new project <a href="https://www.amazon.com/YoungBoy-Explicit-Youngboy-Never-Broke/dp/B07YXGG182?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07YXGG182"><i>AI Youngboy 2</i></a>, can work things out his mother.</p>
      <p><i>XXL</i> has reached out to YoungBoy's camp for comment.</p>

      <h3>6 Feet Deep, Gravediggaz</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Original title:</b>
        <i>Niggamortis</i>
      </p>
      <p>Known as its original title of <i>Niggamortis</i> overseas, Gravediggaz’s debut album got a tamer title for the U.S. consumer.</p>

      <h3>Cypress Hill, Cypress Hill</h3>
      <p><b>Original title:</b> <i>America’s Most Blunted</i></p>

      <p><b>Original title:</b> <i>We Fell Into a Plastic Bottle of Shwingalokate, So We Opened a Radio Station</i></p>
      <p>For the sake of marketing, it’s probably a good idea De La decided to considerably shorten the title of the group's sophomore LP.</p>

      <h3>Reasonable-Doubt, Jay-Z</h3>
      <p><b>Original title:</b> <i>Heir to the Throne</i></p>
      <p>There’s no doubt Hov clearly had his eye on the crown when he initially named his debut album <i>Heir to the Throne</i> before switching it up to <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>.</p>

      <h3>Untitled, Nas</h3>
      <p><b>Original title:</b> <i>Nigger</i></p>
      <p>The N-word was a little too controversial for Nas’ ninth studio album, so Esco begrudgingly dialed it back, opting for no title.</p>
