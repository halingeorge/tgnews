      <p>What lies beyond the Ring Gate? Trouble, a whole lot of trouble!</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-expanse"><b>The Expanse</b></a> was canceled before its time by SYFY, but Amazon Prime revived the series with a two-season order. Earlier today, Amazon dropped a brand new trailer for <b>The Expanse</b> season 4. It also sets up a new mission for James Holden, Naomi Nagata, Alex Kamal, and Amos Burton. Last season, the crew of the Rocinante inadvertently opened a path to thousands of uncharted worlds rich with natural resources. Now, the space land rush is on!</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the planet Ilus is coveted by Earthers, Martians, and Beletrs alike. To complicate matters even further, the long-dead alien civilization behind the Ring Gate may have left some unpleasant surprises behind. Now, ancient ruins are reactivating and there’s struggle for control of the planet.</p>

      <p>Burn Gorman’s Adolphus Murtry makes himself known in the new trailer. He’s the leader of the Belters who have claimed Ilus for their own. And Murtry is more than willing to start a war to hold on to their new home. However, he may come into conflict with Amos long before shots are fired.</p>
      <p><b>The Expanse</b> season 4 will hit Amazon Prime on Friday, December 13.</p>
