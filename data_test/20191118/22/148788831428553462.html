      <h1>‘Fast and Furious: Spy Racers’ Animated Series Reveals Cast (Including Vin Diesel’s Daughter) and New Images</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:00:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/ben-pearson/" target="_blank">Ben Pearson</a></address>
      <p>Justin Lin’s <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> doesn’t hit theaters until May 2020, but if you’re dying for more stories set in the <i>Fast</i> universe, you won’t have to wait nearly that long to see one. <i><b>Fast and Furious: Spy Racers</b></i>, the new animated series from Universal and DreamWorks Animation, arrives on Netflix in just over a month, and the studio just sent out a batch of new images from the show as well as the full cast list. Check them out below, and learn who Vin Diesel’s daughter is playing in the series.</p>
      <p>We’ve known for a little while that this new series would focus on Dominic Toretto’s cousin, Tony, but now we know that Tony will be voiced by <b>Tyler Posey</b> (<i>Teen Wolf</i>). Here’s the official synopsis:</p>
      <blockquote>Teenager Tony Toretto follows in the footsteps of his cousin Dom when he and his friends are recruited by a government agency to infiltrate an elite racing league serving as a front for a nefarious crime organization called SH1FT3R bent on world domination.</blockquote>
      <p><b>Tim Hedrick</b> (<i>DreamWorks Voltron Legendary Defender</i>) and <b>Bret Haaland</b> (<i>DreamWorks All Hail King Julien</i>) are the series showrunners, and they executive produce alongside <b>Vin Diesel</b>, <b>Chris Morgan</b>, and <b>Neal Moritz</b>, who have all been key creatives in the live-action films.</p>
      <p>Posey is joined by <b>Camille Ramsey </b>(<i>American Vandal</i>) as Layla Gray, a notable underground racer who works for SH1FT3R; <b>Luke Youngblood</b> (<i>Harry Potter</i>) as Frostee Benson, a 13-year old tech genius; <b>Charlet Chung</b> (<i>Overwatch</i>) as Echo, a wildly talented artist and natural spy; and <b>Jorge Diaz</b> (<i>Jane the Virgin</i>) as Cisco Renaldo, both the muscle and the sweetheart of the crew.</p>
      <p>Guest stars include Vin’s daughter <b>Similce Diesel </b>as Frostee’s younger sister Sissy; <b>Manish Dayal</b>  (<i>The Resident</i>) as Shashi Dhar, the leader of the criminal organization SH1FT3R; and <i>American Vandal</i> season one standout <b>Jimmy Tatro</b> as a local knucklehead named Mitch. Plus, <i>Hamilton</i> breakout <b>Renée Elise Goldsberry</b> – who is also very good in this year’s indie film Waves – plays the team’s secret agent liaison Ms. Nowhere; I suspect she’s a member of the same secret organization as Kurt Russell’s Mr. Nobody.</p>
      <p>Additional guest characters will be voiced by <b>Carlos Alazraqui</b> (<i>The Fairly OddParents</i>), <b>Eric Bauza</b> (<i>The Adventures of Puss in Boots</i>), <b>Grey Griffin</b> (<i>DC Super Hero Girls</i>), <b>Kevin Michael Richardson</b> (<i>Trolls: The Beat Goes On!</i>), <b>Fred Tatasciore</b> (<i>Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia</i>), and <b>Tru Valentino</b> (<i>Archibald’s Next Big Thing</i>).</p>
