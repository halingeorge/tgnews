      <h1>Analyst Suggests LSU Could Have An “Oklahoma” Problem</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:06:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>LSU has seized the No. 1 ranking in college football in decidedly atypical fashion for a Tiger team. Whereas in the past LSU has been led by its defense, it is the team’s offense that is carrying the load this season.</p>
      <p>Led by quarterback Joe Burrow, the likely Heisman Trophy winner, LSU’s offense might be the most explosive in the country. The Tigers are second in the nation in total offense, second in scoring offense and third in yards per play.</p>
      <p>However, the team’s defense isn’t performing at its usual level. That’s why one analyst thinks the Tigers might be in trouble if they reach the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>247Sports’ Chris Hummer <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/LSU-football-defense-College-Football-Playoff-Oklahoma-comparison-138816612/">outlined his case</a> for LSU having what he deems an “Oklahoma” problem. Oklahoma’s potent offense got the Sooners to the CFP the last two seasons, but a porous defense doomed any chance of a national title.</p>
      <p>Hummer compares LSU’s defensive stats through 10 games to where Oklahoma was at the same point last year, and there are some similarities, among other issues he points out.</p>
      <blockquote>LSU doesn’t make up for its middling defensive stats by producing sacks (68th nationally) or turnovers (56th). The Tigers’ saving grace is they’re tough on third down (20th nationally) and in the red zone (20th nationally).<br/><br/>Perhaps the most concerning thing for LSU is its fellow unbeatens, Clemson and Ohio State, compare favorably to the Tigers offensively. Clemson is fourth nationally in yards per play and Ohio State is sixth. Defensively, however, the Buckeyes and Clemson Tigers are first and second respectively in yards allowed per play. Remember, LSU comes in at 53rd in that category.</blockquote>
      <p>LSU’s defense still contains a lot of high-end talent, so perhaps the Tigers tighten things up over the next few weeks. Even if they don’t, they should be able to outscore almost anybody they play.</p>
      <p>The one team that perhaps poses the biggest threat on paper is Ohio State, which has played better competition than Clemson, and like Hummer mentions below, is virtually on par with LSU offensively.</p>
