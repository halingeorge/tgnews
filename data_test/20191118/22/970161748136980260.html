      <p>Mateo Kovacic insists <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> is the ‘perfect teacher’ for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>’s young guns and has lifted the lid on how the manager behaves around the squad.</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s all-time record goalscorer returned to Stamford Bridge in the summer following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maurizio-sarri/">Maurizio Sarri</a>’s departure and has already made a big impact in west London.</p>
      <p>Under Lampard, Chelsea have climbed to third in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> table, receiving plaudits for their exciting and attacking style of football.</p>

      <p>Kovacic says Lampard is a ‘great guy’ who enjoys laughing and joking with the Chelsea squad and insists his team-mates are enjoying playing under the legendary midfielder.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been nice, nice of course,’ Kovacic told Chelsea’s official website. ‘Now I see why he was such a great player.</p>
      <p>‘His mentality is really strong. That’s what he wants to bring to us: to have a strong mentality, a winning mentality. He always won a lot of trophies.</p>

      <p>‘He has a great connection with every player. He is a great guy, he likes to joke, he likes to laugh. He’s the perfect teacher for us.</p>
      <p>‘We need to learn from him, and for now we are enjoying it, he is as well enjoying it, so it’s a nice connection.</p>
      <p>‘Now the moment is good, when the tough moments come it will be a test for us and for him, but we need to keep training as we are doing.</p>
      <p>‘We are working really hard. Four months he has been here, and every training was hard, and that’s important being at such a great club like Chelsea.’</p>

      <p>Former Real Madrid man Kovacic, who turned his loan spell at Chelsea into a permanent transfer last summer, helped the Blues win the Europa League in May.</p>
      <p>Kovavic produced a superb performance in the final against Arsenal but said: ‘I don’t think about what I have achieved or what I have to achieve; I think about what the team has to achieve.</p>
      <p>‘That’s obviously trophies. Chelsea is a club that has always won trophies, needs to win trophies, and this year we need to go for everything. Then what happens, happens.’</p>
