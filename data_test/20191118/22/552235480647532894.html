      <h1>Jack Ross reveals Hibs were always his most likely destination despite Hearts links</h1>
      <h2>There was interest in the former Sunderland manager from both capital clubs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:29:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Jack Ross was a candidate for both the Hibs and Hearts managerial vacancies, but says Easter Road was always his likely destination.</p>
      <p>The former Sunderland boss was officially presented to the media after penning a three-and-half-year deal to replace <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> last week.</p>
      <p>With both capital clubs in the unusual position of seeking a new manager at the same time, Ross was linked with both, having previously been Under 20s coach at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>Things progressed quickly after meeting with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a>’ chief executive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Leeann Dempster</a> and head of football operations Graeme Mathie and both parties felt the other was a good fit,</p>
      <p>“I was in a position where I was out of work and two really big jobs became available at the same time in Scotland,” he said.</p>
      <p>“One, you can be associated sometimes, rightly or wrongly. Two, there may be an interest from you in getting back into management.</p>

      <p>“But once I had the initial conversations with Hibs and things progressed from there, I was consistent and strong in my want to come here. Graeme would emphasise that.</p>
      <p>“I just felt as if it was the right club for me to come back to Scotland to. Once things developed, it was really a case of me trying to prove my worth to them and get the nuts and bolts of everything agreed. It was pretty straightforward once we both felt as if we were right for each other.”</p>
      <p>Next on the list for Ross is appointing an assistant manager, with John Potter expected to leave Sunderland in order to join him at Hibstoday. “Obviously there’s a large number of staff already at the club who have been looking after the players in the interim period,” said Ross.</p>
      <p>“I hope to name assistant manager by today which I think is an important first step for me, someone who will understand my processes and how I work and then we will work with the people in situ and go from there.</p>
      <p>“Coming in mid-season is always more challenging than coming in pre-season, you have to make sure as best you can for games and we have right away between now and December a lot of games, a busy period. So hopefully we’ll confirm that over the next day or so.”</p>
      <p>Current Sunderland boss Phil Parkinson confirmed that the process has already begun. "There has been contact between Hibs and Sunderland about John Potter,” he said.</p>
      <p>"We are held further talks about that yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"There is the obvious lure of going back to Scotland for John and if he does go, we will wish him all the best."</p>
