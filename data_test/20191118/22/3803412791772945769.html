      <p><a href="https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a> is now available, which means we're all out there catching 'em all in the new region of Galar. One of the new features is Max Raid Battles, which are essentially boss battles with wild Dynamax Pokémon in the Wild Area. There are a few ways to participate in these, but one of the best ways is with friends for a fun co-op Pokémon experience. Here's all you need to know about how to take down those tough Pokémon with your friends.</p>

      <p>Before you can start taking on Max Raid battles, you will need to find them first. In order to find the Pokémon dens that these Max Raid battles take place in, you need to reach the Wild Area first.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the Wild Area is introduced pretty early on in the game, shortly after you get your starter Pokémon and embark on your journey. The Wild Area is a large and vast area that is full of many different species of Pokémon, depending on the weather of the section you're in, and where you find Max Raid dens, among other treasures and goodies. It's important to note that some Pokémon you'll encounter in the Wild Area will be a much higher level, and you won't be able to capture the stronger Pokémon without the proper number of gym badges.</p>
      <p>For Max Raid Dens, you need to look for the red glowing rocks with a hole in the center. If it is a Max Raid Den, then there will be a glowing pillar of light coming from the center hole. But you should always interact with the Raid Dens, regardless if there is a Max Raid battle, as you'll earn Watts from them, which you can spend on items and bike upgrades.</p>

      <h3>How to find open Max Raid Battles started by others</h3>

        <li>Setting up the Link Code means you've just created a <b>private</b> Max Raid Battle.</li>
        <li>If you want to <b>join</b> a Link Code Max Raid Battle, just interact with the Raid Den as normal but <b>input</b> the 4-digit Link Code number.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Anyone who inputs the Link Code will automatically join in on the original lobby created with the Link Code.</p>

      <p>All Max Raid Battles are designed for four trainers to work together in order to take down these larger-than-life Pokémon. However, if your friends are not playing, or you just don't want to deal with strangers, you can always just work alone.</p>
      <p>Just select the <b>Don't Invite</b> option when interacting with Raid Dens, and the game will provide three computer AI trainers to help you out. They may not be the best trainers, but hey, every little bit helps.</p>

      <p>At first, the Dynamax Pokémon that you'll find in Max Raid Battles may be intimidating, since they're huge, tanky, and have stronger moves and abilities than normal wild Pokémon. But they're really not that difficult to take down, as long as you pay attention.</p>
      <p>Since you are able to see the typing for the Dynamax Pokémon before you start the battle, plan ahead. Pick a Pokémon that is strong against it, and Dynamax your Pokémon at the start for maximum effectiveness. Since every trainer will have their own turn to Dynamax, and a Dynamaxed Pokémon lasts for three turns, take advantage of it. Usually, you'll be able to take down a Max Raid Battle Pokémon in one hit if you Dynamax your Pokémon and use a move that the Max Raid Pokémon is weak against.</p>
      <p>Once a Max Raid Battle Pokémon is defeated, you have the option of catching it or skipping it. I would recommend always catching it since these do not run, and you're guaranteed the catch. You'll also get a ton of good rewards regardless of whether or not you catch the Pokémon after defeating it.</p>
      <h3>Gotta catch and Dynamax 'em all!</h3>
      <p>Max Raid Battles are a new feature introduced in Pokémon Sword and Shield, but it's a great way to work with others to take down tough foes and get great rewards. It's easy to lose yourself in the Wild Area for a few hours just going around collecting Watts and doing Max Raid Battles, so it's a great way to easily collect and fill up your Pokédex.</p>
