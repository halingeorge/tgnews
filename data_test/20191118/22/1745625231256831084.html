      <p>The YouTube Original will premiere in spring 2020 and feature a $50,000 prize.</p>
      <p>James Charles is scouting rising beauty stars on <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/youtube/">YouTube</a> with his new reality TV show, set to air exclusively on his YouTube channel in Spring 2020.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.insider.com/james-charles-beauty-influencer-competition-show-2019-11">Insider</a></i>, the 20-year-old YouTuber, who announced that he will host, direct and produce the show, is on the hunt for make-up-artists who have what it takes to not only produce content but tap into the cosmetic and beauty industry in a way that can draw a following and inspire people.</p>
      <p>“Being a superstar influencer takes a whole lot more than just blending eyeshadow, and I can’t wait to find out who has what it takes to make it to the top,” Charles said. “Producing my own show for YouTube is going to be a crazy challenge but I’m so ready — and hopefully the beauty community is too.”</p>
      <p>The reality show, developed in partnership with the platform as a YouTube Original, will enlist six established beauty YouTubers to compete in challenges that have yet to be disclosed. The audition asks for a 5-minute YouTube video tagged #JamesCharlesCasting modeled after Charles popular ‘Chit Chat Get Ready With Me’ video, which has over 4 million views.</p>
      <p>Prospectives have until November 21 to submit their application, after which, the chosen contestants will be flown to Los Angeles to compete for the grand prize of $50,000.</p>
      <p>Charles took to his Twitter to share his excitement about the casting call videos.</p>

      <p>“Didn’t Elle and Blair Fowler do this back in the day? I swear I remember something kind of similar,” asked one Redditor.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to hold my judgement [sic] till i’ve actually seen it, he’s not revealed very much right now. I think it’s more interesting than just makeup but we’ll have to see how well the execution is,” posted another Reddit user.</p>
      <p>This venture with YouTube Originals is one of the first major forays back into the limelight for Charles, who was embroiled in several scandals earlier this year, including a public dispute with fellow influencer Tati Westbrook, and <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5598429/james-charles-nude-photo/">leaking his own nudes on Twitter</a> after being the victim of blackmail. According to <i><a href="https://www.papermag.com/james-charles-subscribers-2637006896.html">Papermag</a></i>, the conflict with Westbrook caused a large rift in the online beauty community and led to Charles losing over two million subscribers.</p>
      <p>“Most of my career over the past few years has been about me making mistakes and trying to learn and grow from them,” Charles said in a public apology video on his channel. “I haven’t always done the best job of that, I can admit that. But I have always tried.”</p>
