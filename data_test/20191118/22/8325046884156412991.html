        <li>Many people pointed to the success of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/popeyes">Popeyes’ chicken sandwich</a> as convincing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/chick-fil-a">Chick-fil-A</a> to end its donations to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes on Monday.</li>
        <li>However, Chick-fil-A appears to have cut its controversial donations earlier this year – before Popeyes rolled out its chicken sandwich.</li>
        <li>A Chick-fil-A representative said the company’s decision was separate from Popeyes’ sandwich rollout.</li>
        <li>Chick-fil-A’s expansion efforts are far more relevant to the donations decision than the arrival of Popeyes’ chicken sandwich.</li>

      <p>When news broke on Monday that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-ending-donations-criticized-by-lgbtq-activists-2019-11">Chick-fil-A would no longer donate to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes,</a> many people had one question: Is Popeyes responsible for this?</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A announced that it had changed its donation strategy to focus on groups addressing education, homelessness, and hunger. The company will no longer make multiyear commitments, instead reassessing commitments annually.</p>
      <p>The news comes in the aftermath of the chicken sandwich wars earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The arrival of Popeyes’ chicken sandwich in September raised questions as to whether Chick-fil-A was still the king of the chicken sandwich. With <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-sales-boost-even-when-off-menu-2019-10">Popeyes’ chicken sandwich returning to menus in early November,</a> some people saw Chick-fil-A’s decision to end the controversial donations as a reaction to the buzz around its rival.</p>
      <p>“@PopeyesChicken put the squeeze on you with that chicken sandwich, now you’re desperate for more market share,” tweeted New York Times columnist Charles Blow.</p>

      <p>Many of the comments on Popeyes forcing Chick-fil-A to change direction are at least somewhat tongue-in-cheek. But, with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-sales-boost-even-when-off-menu-2019-10">Popeyes’ sales skyrocketing when the sandwich launched,</a> it is easy to see why people have made the connection.</p>
      <p>However, a Chick-fil-A representative told Business Insider that the company’s decision has nothing to do with Popeyes. And, taking a closer look at the documents that Chick-fil-A released on Monday, it is clear that the change has been in the works since long before <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-vs-chick-fil-a-which-is-better-2019-8">Popeyes’ chicken sandwich debuted in August</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Chick-fil-A donated $1.6 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and $150,000 to the Salvation Army. According to tax returns released on Monday, Chick-fil-A once again donated to $1.6 million to the FCA and $115,000 to the Salvation Army in 2018.</p>
      <p>However, both organizations are missing from Chick-fil-A’s list of <a href="https://www.chick-fil-afoundation.org/news-events/why-we-give-continuing-the-legacy-of-our-founder">2019 donations,</a> which includes groups such as Morehouse College, Westside Future Fund Inc, and the Steve &amp; Marjorie Harvey Foundation. In other words, while the Chick-fil-A Foundation’s official tax returns for 2019 will not be released for another year, the company seems to have stopped donating to the controversial groups before Popeyes’ chicken sandwich hit menus.</p>
      <h3>Chick-fil-A’s sales were booming even as backlash built</h3>
      <p>So, why did Chick-fil-A actually change its donations policy? There is likely a partially strategic decision – but it isn’t directly related to Popeyes’ chicken sandwich.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A has been expanding across the US and beyond in recent years. It has become the third-largest chain in the US by sales, growing revenue by 16.7% in 2018 to reach nearly $10.5 billion, according to <a href="https://www.nrn.com/data-research/top-200-restaurants">Nation’s Restaurant News.</a></p>

      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-chick-fil-a-took-over-america-2019-8">Since 2012,</a> Chick-fil-A has tried to separate itself from political and cultural battles waged by the right and left. However, as the company has gone from a regional Southern chain to an international brand, coverage of its anti-LGBTQ reputation has grown – despite pushback from the company.</p>
      <p>“We are a restaurant company that’s focused on influence, really great food, really great service,” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-chick-fil-a-took-over-america-2019-8">Carrie Kurlander, Chick-fil-A’s vice president of external communications said earlier this year.</a> “That’s the conversation that we believe we should be in.”</p>
      <p>People inside Chick-fil-A feel much of this coverage is not representative of Chick-fil-A’s values. While the company embraces the Christian faith of founder Truett Cathy – whose son, Dan Cathy, is now CEO – Rodney Bullard, the head of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, says that this faith does not require exclusion.</p>
      <p>“The family has not, particularly Truett, did not shy away from his faith,” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-explains-donations-groups-considered-anti-gay-2019-5">Bullard told Business Insider in May.</a> “And his faith was a faith of opportunity and faith of inclusion, actually.”</p>
      <p>Despite backlash, as of earlier this year, Bullard and others at Chick-fil-A did not think that these partnerships were morally wrong. The partnerships exclusively funded non-religious, youth programs and, according to Bullard, were “relevant and impactful in the community.”</p>
      <p>“For us, that’s a much higher calling than any political or cultural war that’s being waged,” Bullard said.</p>
      <p>In recent years, protests and media coverage of backlash against Chick-fil-A have frequently been sparked by new waves of expansion.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A has been opening more locations in urban areas, such as New York City, and is exploring international expansion, including in Canada. In October, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-backlash-as-expands-into-uk-2019-10">news broke that the six-month lease of a pilot location in the UK would not be renewed</a> following a local <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2951433151553379/?active_tab=about">protest</a> with the stated goal of enlightening “potential patrons to the Chick-fil-A chain and their anti LGBT+ stance.”</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A’s president and chief operating officer, Tim Tassopoulos, made the connection between expansion and the new approach to charitable donations explicit in an interview published on Monday.</p>
      <p>“There’s no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are,” Tassopoulos <a href="https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/retail/exclusive-amid-global-expansion-and-lgbt-pushback-chick-fil-a-changes-charitable-giving-structure-101818">told real-estate publication Bisnow.</a> “There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message.”</p>
      <p>The decision to end its donations to controversial groups was not a hasty choice in reaction to Popeyes’ chicken sandwich. Instead, it is a strategic move from a swiftly growing company, made based on what new potential customers consider acceptable and what they consider unacceptable.</p>
