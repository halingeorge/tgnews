      <h3>U2 are in town ahead of their show at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday, and on Monday night FIVEaa’s Jeremy Cordeaux casually mentioned the band have arranged to come around and see his car collection.</h3>
      <p>Jeremy told listeners (and his floored producer Angie):</p>
      <blockquote>“A dear friend of mine who knows Bono -- I didn’t even know they were in town… anyway, it was said, ‘Would you mind if they come up and look at the garage?’<br/><br/>“I said no that’s fine -- tomorrow or the next day. It’s not my idea, it was just would I mind if they came up and looked at the cars… I don’t know when, so don’t line up at the front of the house.”</blockquote>
