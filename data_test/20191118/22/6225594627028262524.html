        <b>Google Maps is testing a new feature that allows users to find and follow other users, more specifically looking to connect users to top “Local Guides.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you ask experts what makes a platform “social,” most will answer that it is the ability to connect with and/or follow other users.</p>
      <p>Google Maps is set to take its biggest ever step towards being more of a social networking platform, as it begins testing a new feature that allows users to follow top “Local Guides” – its community members who actively review businesses, post photos and share detailled information on Google Maps.</p>
      <p>As part of the test, users in select markets are now able to follow their Local Guides by clicking on a new “follow” button that appears on their profiles. Once you follow someone, their recommendations and updates will be shown for you when using Google Maps, as part of a new “For You” section.</p>
      <p>The test is live in selected market/cities across the world: Bangkok, Delhi, London, Mexico City, New York, Osaka, San Francisco, São Paulo, and Tokyo.</p>
