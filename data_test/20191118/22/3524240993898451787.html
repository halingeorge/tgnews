      <p>Three cows swept into the ocean when Hurricane Dorian struck the US east coast in September were found living on a string of sandy islands miles away from their home, US media reports.</p>
      <p>The bovine trio is believed to have swum four to five miles (six to 10 kilometres) before placing hoof on land — in this case an island of sand dunes and scattered vegetation that is part of North Carolina’s Outer Banks, the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>The animals were recently discovered by park rangers at the Cape Lookout National Seashore, a long chain of undeveloped barrier islands off the North Carolina coast.</p>
      <p>Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm.</p>
      <p>Category One Hurricane Dorian created a “mini-tsunami” that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6.</p>
      <p>The cows were identified by their keeper, Woody Hancock. They will likely be sedated and sent home on a boat, a Park spokeswoman told the Observer.</p>
