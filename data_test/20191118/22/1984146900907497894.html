      <p>I'm A Celebrity's Caitlyn Jenner has revealed she wanted to become a woman a lot earlier than she actually did in a candid chat with her camp mates, which also saw her discuss her famous children.</p>
      <p>The subject of Caitlyn's transition and her reality TV famous family was first raised by Kate Garraway who asked the 70-year-old if she’d ever had any doubts when Keeping Up With The Kardashians started, about letting the cameras in her home.</p>
      <p>She said no and then Jacqueline asked <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-17271943">Caitlyn</a> if her kids knew if she was doing the UK version <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I’m A Celebrity</a> , having competed in the American show over a decade as Bruce Jenner, to which she said they all knew.</p>
      <p>Opening about her struggles with her gender identity, which date back way longer than 2015, which is when Caitlyn first revealed herself to the world as woman in a frank interview with US TV host Diane Sawyer and a now famous Vanity Fair cover.</p>
      <p>She added “I thought I was gonna transition before I was 40, I didn’t want to be an old chick but this is the latter 80’s and I never felt like I fitted in anywhere, I was trying to figure myself out, running around town."</p>
      <p>"At the time, I had a turbo Porsche and it was like the day before Halloween and this car pulled up beside me and it’s my next door neighbour, I said I was going to a Halloween party.”</p>
      <p>Listening intently, James said “It’s interesting about wanting to express yourself and how hard it is in life wanting to express yourself but having a thing where you can’t let it and that you have to drive around town. </p>
      <p>"I think the biggest thing about your thing is all those people thinking about not being able to do it is the fact they should feel comfortable to do it however hard it is because 99% of the time it’ll work out alright.”</p>
      <p>“All my life I struggled with all of those” said Caitlyn.</p>
      <p>James then asked Caitlyn if she had a music track she played whilst driving around town, Caitlyn laughed and said “Yes, Aerosmith’s Looks like A Lady”, the camp all started to sing it.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn smiled and said “When I saw Steven Tyler I told him that.”</p>
