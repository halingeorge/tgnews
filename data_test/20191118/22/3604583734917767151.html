      <h1>Federation University Arts Academy visual arts graduates show off their final works in the annual end of year exhibition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Smith</a></address>
      <p>After 11 years of study, Federation University Arts Academy ceramics student Marian Fox has finally completed her visual arts degree.</p>
      <p>Having been forced to balance competing interests with her arts studies, Ms Fox has taken the long route to graduate - but that's not the end of her studies.</p>
      <p>Ms Fox has finished her course in the best way possible, as recipient of the Cheryl Twomey Memorial Award given to a ceramics student who has displayed exceptional commitment to their studies and shows potential to develop and extend their professional art practice in the future.</p>

      <p>She is also one of 40 graphic design, ceramics, creative arts, print making and other visual arts students who are part of the annual End of Year Exhibition at Ballarat's Mining Exchange.</p>
      <p>"The great thing about the End of Year Exhibition is it allows students to put their work out there and gain confidence," Ms Fox said.</p>
      <p>"I work in ceramics and this year I have created a series of large vessels with various surface treatments and oxides.</p>
      <p>"This exhibition is a significant moment for me as I am finally completing my Visual Arts degree after 11 years. I have had to balance a lot of things and that's why it has taken so long - I am not leaving though - I am coming back to do a post-graduate degree."</p>
