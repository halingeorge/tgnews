      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:46:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Shares of debt-ridden Reliance Communications (RCom) on Monday tumbled over 8 per cent after the company posted a consolidated loss of Rs 30,142 crore for September quarter 2019.</p>
      <p>The company's scrip dropped 3.39 per cent to close at Rs 0.57 -- its record low -- on the BSE.</p>
      <p>At the NSE, it tanked 8.33 per cent to close at Rs 0.55.</p>
      <p>RCom on Friday posted a consolidated loss of Rs 30,142 crore for July-September 2019 due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.</p>
      <p>The company, which is going through the insolvency process, had made a profit of Rs 1,141 crore in the corresponding three months a year ago.</p>
      <p>The apex court last month upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses in calculating the annual adjusted gross revenue (AGR), a share of which has to be paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.</p>
      <p>RCom Chairman Anil Ambani along with four directors has resigned from the company, which is going through the insolvency process, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>Chief financial officer Manikantan V has also resigned, the filing said.</p>
      <p>"Anil D Ambani, Chhaya Virani, Manjari Kacker have tendered their resignation as Director of Company on November 15th, 2019," the filing said.Â </p>
