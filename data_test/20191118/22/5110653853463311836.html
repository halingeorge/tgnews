The stadium, located7,201 feet above sea level in Mexico City, will host a regular-season NFL game for the fourth time (2005, 2016 and 2017).</p>
      <p>The Chiefs have dominated their series with the Chargers of late, winning nine of the last 10, and are favored by 4 1/2 points in Monday night's game. Much of that has to do with their quarterback.</p>

      <p>Patrick Mahomes has 6 touchdowns and no interceptions for a 122.2 passer rating in his two career games against the Chargers. He also is on a hot streak against AFC West teams in general and looking for his seventh division game in a row with a passer rating of 105 or better.</p>
      <p>His QB counterpart Monday night is coming off a rough gamein LA's loss to Oakland last week, but Philip Rivers still entered Week 11 leading the NFL in passing yards with 2,816. Rivers also tends to play well against Kansas City; he has 6,870 career passing yards against the Chargers, his most against any opponent.</p>

      <h3>Who plays on Monday Night Football tonight?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Kansas City Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Chargers in Mexico City</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Kickoff time:</b> 8:15 p.m. ET</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In both our NFL Week 11picks against the spread and straight-up predictions, Sporting News projected a Chiefsvictory over the Chargers on Monday night. Below are the explanations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-11-nfl-picks-against-the-spread/u5np7y4smrzt1jdzpvoum8qln/14">Pick against the spread</a>: The Chiefs were supposed to play this game in Mexico City against the other Los Angeles team last season, a shootout they lost in LA, instead. Kansas City will get back on track with plenty of Patrick Mahomes, set up well by the running game, ripping apart the Chargers' defense. Philip Rivers will keep slumping against an underrated pass rush, and Melvin Gordon will not run well enough to save the night. <i>Pick: Chiefs win 34-27 and cover the spread</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-11-nfl-picks-predictions/1sb3n5rbwqxjg1elyenztbbj0s/14">Straight-up prediction</a>:Let's try this again. The field issues that forced Mexico City's game to move to LA last year reportedly won't resurface, so fans at Estadio Azteca finally will get their Patrick Mahomes show. Speaking of resurfacing, will the old Philip Rivers eventually show up this season? The Chargers are far from done as contenders in the AFC, but they'll trend that way if their QB's struggles continue. They'll need big numbers from him Monday in order to keep up with the Chiefs. <i>Pick: Chiefs 30, Chargers 26</i>.</p>
