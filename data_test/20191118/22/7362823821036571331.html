      <h1>Amazon deforestation in Brazil hits 11-year high, data shows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:45:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author">Bradford Betz</a></address>
      <p>Deforestation in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/brazil">Brazil’s Amazon rainforest</a> has risen to its highest level in more than a decade, according to new data from a government report Monday that seemed to confirm an increase under President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>Between August 2018 and July of this year, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/amazon-fire-brazil-burning-ban-bolsonaro-land-clearing">deforestation</a> reached 3,769 square miles, a 30 percent increase over the previous year, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research said.</p>

      <p>The area of deforestation, roughly the equivalent in size of the U.S. states of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/delaware">Delaware</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/rhode-island">Rhode Island</a> combined, is the largest recorded since 2008.</p>
      <p>Concern about the Amazon rose after Bolsonaro <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/what-brazils-bolsonaro-will-likely-tackle-in-first-months">took office in January</a>. His administration has advocated deregulation around natural reserves and indigenous lands to promote economic development.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/environment">Environmentalists</a> and nonprofit groups have warned that weakening environmental legislation will increase deforestation.</p>
      <p>The annual data published by the space research agency Monday confirms earlier reports that deforestation was on the rise; the latest data is actually 42 percent higher than what was previously reported.</p>
      <p>In July and August, fires in the Amazon region spread at a pace unseen since 2010, before slowing in September.</p>

      <p>Some European leaders have questioned <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/brazil-president-jair-bolsonaro-amazon-fire-surgery">Brazil’s commitment to tackling deforestation</a> and argued that the fires in the Amazon required a global response because of the ecosystem's critical role in draining heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian government has denied any wrongdoing and says it is taking all the steps needed to protect the Amazon.</p>

      <p>As fires raged a few months ago, Bolsonaro sent the military to help battle some blazes and banned most legal fires for land-clearing in the Amazon for two months. Fires in the Amazon eventually fell below the monthly average in September.</p>
