      <p>HOUSTON -- The final year of Yuli Gurriel's five-year contract, which runs through 2020, called for a player option that would allow the first baseman to either renegotiate his salary or opt out and go to arbitration.</p>
      <p>Gurriel, a source confirmed on Monday, agreed to a new contract for 2020 worth $8.3 million, up from the original $8 million, with an opportunity to earn $250,000 more in bonuses. As was determined when he signed his original deal nearly four years ago, he will become a free agent after the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old Gurriel signed a five-year contract worth $47.5 million in July 2016, shortly after defecting from Cuba with his brother, Lourdes Jr., an outfielder with the Blue Jays. After appearing in 36 games for Houston in '16, Gurriel took over full-time duties at first base in '17 while serving as one of many anchors in a loaded lineup that contributed to three straight American League West titles and a World Series championship two years ago.</p>
      <p>Over four seasons, Gurriel is slashing .293/.330/.478 with a 115 OPS+. He reached career highs in 2019 with 31 homers and 104 RBIs, and he was named AL Player of the Month in July after hitting .408 with 12 homers and 31 RBIs.</p>
      <p>Gurriel is one of several key Astros eligible to hit free agency after the 2020 season, along with George Springer, Michael Brantley, Josh Reddick, Brad Peacock and Jake Marisnick.</p>
