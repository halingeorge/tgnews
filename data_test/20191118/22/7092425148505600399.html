        <b>It was a case of mixed emotions for Mick McCarthy after Ireland's 1-1 draw with Denmark.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He revealed he was busy giving out to Matt Doherty about his mistake in the buildup to Denmark's goal and forgot to congratulate him.</p>
      <p>"I was giving out to him about the goal and forgot to congratulate him about the goal scored!"</p>
      <p>Speaking at his post-match press conference, McCarthy outlined how proud he was of his team.</p>
      <p>As for the play-offs, he insisted Ireland can win if they replicate tonight's performance.</p>
      <p>"Mixed emotions, I'm very proud of the lads though.</p>
      <p>"I've got three months to prepare for that [play-offs], play as well as that and we can beat them.</p>
      <p>"We played well, we competed well. If they leave everything on the pitch for me, the lads, I'll take that. That's the only thing I'm disappointed with [the goal conceded].</p>
      <p>"We'd played well up until conceding."</p>
      <p>McCarthy insisted he wasn't disappointed with any result in the campaign in particular.</p>
      <p>"No, I'm here to talk about this performance and this game."</p>
      <p>On Ireland's possession game, McCarthy said they "played exactly how I asked them to play. There'd be no team of mine who go out and just do what they want".</p>
