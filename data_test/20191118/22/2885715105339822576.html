      <h1>Chautala, Vij locked in legal tussle over defamation suit</h1>
      <h2>Talking to The Indian Express, Dushyant said, “I am not going to step back. I will take this case to its logical conclusion unless Mr Vij withdraws his remark passed against me and apologises for his statement”.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:55:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/varinder-bhatia/" target="_blank">Varinder Bhatia</a></address>
      <p>The new Haryana government has two of its top and most powerful ministers locked in a legal battle from which neither is willing to back down. Deputy Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/dushyant-chautala">Dushyant Chautala</a> stands firm on taking the defamation case against state’s Home Minister Anil Vij to its “logical conclusion”, while the latter too appears in no mood to take a step back.</p>
      <p>Both Dushyant and Vij are facing off in a sessions court in Hisar. Last year, Dushyant had alleged a scam in the state’s Health Department, reacting to which Vij had passed an objectionable personal remark against Dushyant. Subsequently, Dushyant, who was an MP from Hisar at that time, had filed a criminal defamation case against Vij, the then state Health Minister.</p>
      <p>Since August 14 last year, there have been 12 hearings in the Hisar’s sessions court in the case. While Dushyant has already closed his “preliminary evidence” and the statements of two witnesses from complainant’s side have also been recorded by the court, the case has now reached the stage of ‘arguments on summoning the accused’ to the court. In most of the subsequent hearings, Dushyant had sought exemptions from personal appearance.</p>
      <p>Talking to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, Dushyant said, “I am not going to step back. I will take this case to its logical conclusion unless Mr Vij withdraws his remark passed against me and apologises for his statement”.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Vij too appeared firm on his stance and told The Indian Express that he will “see what to do, when the time comes”. “Till this time, I do not know what he (Dushyant) has done. I have not received anything yet in writing. I will see what to do when I receive anything and when the time comes,” Vij said.</p>
