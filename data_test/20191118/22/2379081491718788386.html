      <p>* Denotes a series of Notes for which the calculation of the applicable Total Consideration may be performed using the value of such Notes as determined at the applicable price determination time (as set forth in the Offer to Purchase) as if the principal amount of such Notes had been due on the applicable par call date. <br/>** Denotes a series of Notes, a portion of which is held in physical certificated form and is not held through The Depositary Trust Company. <br/>+ Denotes a series of Notes with respect to which, as a result of a prior consent solicitation on this series, requisite consent was received and a supplemental indenture was executed, eliminating substantially all restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions of the indenture governing this series.</p>
      <p>Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal, holders who validly tender at or prior to the Expiration Date and who do not validly withdraw Notes at or prior to the Withdrawal Deadline, subject in each case to the tender in the applicable minimum denominations, and whose Notes are accepted for purchase by AT&amp;T, will receive the applicable Total Consideration specified below.</p>
      <p>The Total Consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of a series of Notes that is validly tendered and accepted for purchase, and not validly withdrawn (and subject to the applicable minimum denominations), will be determined by reference to the applicable fixed spread specified in the Offer to Purchase over the applicable reference yield based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Security.</p>
      <p>In addition to the applicable Total Consideration, holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will be paid accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to, but not including, the Settlement Date. Interest will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all Notes accepted.
