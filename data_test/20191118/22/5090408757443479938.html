      <p>The world wide web is a wild place, and many of the millions of sites out there are better left unvisited.</p>
      <p>This is especially true when you’re at work or with the kids – fortunately, your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-limit-screen-time-on-iphone">iPhone’s Screen Time feature</a> can limit access to websites you’d rather not have pop up on that screen.</p>
      <p>If you <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-block-websites-on-iphone">blocked</a> access to a website you now wish to visit, you can undo the block in a matter of seconds, either by allowing that specific site or by turning off all restrictions. Both actions are handled in the same place.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to do it.</p>
