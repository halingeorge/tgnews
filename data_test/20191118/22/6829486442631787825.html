      <p>It’s a time of transition at triple j. Yesterday, <a href="https://junkee.com/tom-tilley-triple-j/230364">the station farewelled Tom Tilley</a>, the host of Hack for almost a decade. Now, they’re saying goodbye to two more longstanding and beloved presenters: Linda Marigliano and Gen Fricker.</p>
      <p>Marigliano will depart as host of triple j’s Mornings by the end of the year, after almost a decade with the station. Well-known for her instrumental role in <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/good-nights/">triple j’s Good Nights</a>, Marigliano has been a fan favourite for many years.</p>
      <p>And hey, if you’re bummed, she’s bummed too. “I feel overwhelmed with joy and genuine love for this station that has been my family for so many years,” Marigliano has written in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Thank you for having me. It’s been fucking beautiful.”</p>

      <p>Fricker, meanwhile, has been the longstanding host of Lunch, and has been with the station for five years.</p>
      <p>“I’m honoured to have spent the last five years talking absolute garbage with some of my best friends, favourite artists, and the greatest listeners in the world,” Fricker has written. “It breaks my heart to leave, but I will be forever grateful for the chance to be a (small) part of such an iconic institution.”</p>
      <p>If you’re eager to learn who will be replacing the presenters, stay tuned for tomorrow — triple j will announce the 2020 presenters lineup then.</p>
