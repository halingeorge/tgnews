Dre</a> have teased that they are working on a sequel to <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review">West’s latest album</a>: ‘Jesus Is King Part II’<i>.</i></p>

      <p>At this stage is is not known what exactly the pair are working on but, given their monumental musical impact, it can be assumed that it will be a sequel album to West’s gospel-inspired <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review">‘Jesus is King’</a> released last month.</p>

      <p>Both West and Dre have worked with other huge names in hip-hop including <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/jay-z">Jay-Z</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/nas">Nas</a> but have not worked together so closely before.</p>
      <p>Ye has made his admiration clear for Dre in the past. In a 2010 <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446/dr-dre-6-88124/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> article he recalled how overwhelmed he was when he met the Californian rapper/producer.</p>

      <p>“I first met Dre in December of 2003. He asked me to produce a track for <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-game">The Game</a>,” West said. “At first I was star-struck, but within 30 minutes I was begging him to mix my next album. He’s the definition of a true talent: Dre feels like God placed him here to make music, and no matter what forces are aligned against him, he always ends up on the mountaintop.”</p>
