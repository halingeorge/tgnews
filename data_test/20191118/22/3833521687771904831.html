      <p>TORONTO -- An Ontario tribunal has upheld rules passed by the City of Toronto on short-term rentals like Airbnb.</p>
      <p>The Local Planning Appeal Tribunal said in a ruling released Monday that it has dismissed an appeal by several residents who objected to the rules that put limits on how people can rent out their properties.</p>
      <p>The city put the rules in place in part over concerns that short-term rentals like Airbnb were reducing the rental stock as the city deals with a housing crisis.</p>
      <p>Tribunal member Scott Tousaw said in the decision that while the numbers of rental units being affected by the rules are in dispute, the phenomenon is not.</p>
      <p>"Whatever the number, one fact is indisputable: each dedicated (short-term rental) unit displaces one permanent household."</p>
      <p>He said the trend of displacement was growing as short-term rental listings have tripled since 2015, with entire-home listings accounting for two-thirds of listings.</p>
      <p>The Toronto rules only allow the short-term rental of an owner's principal residence, or rooms within the residence, and require them to register with the city and pay a four per cent municipal accommodation tax.</p>
      <p>Rentals of secondary suits or other secondary properties can't be rented out on a short-term basis, following similar rules already in place in Mississauga and Oakville, Ont., and Vancouver.</p>
      <p>Residents who appealed the rules said they were overly restrictive, but Tousaw found the rules still allowed opportunities for business and tourism without threatening the housing supply.</p>
      <p>"These opportunities represent a reasonable balancing of several policy objectives."</p>
      <p>Thorben Wieditz, of the Fairbnb Canada group that had pushed to uphold the rules, said in a statement that the ruling represents "a major victory for tenants across Ontario."</p>
      <p>Airbnb spokeswoman Alex Dagg said in a statement that while the ruling provides some regulatory certainty, and it's committed to work to implement them, it still has concerns.</p>
      <p>"We continue to share our hosts' concerns that these rules unfairly punish some responsible short-term rental hosts who are contributing to the local economy."</p>
      <p>Toronto initially passed the short-term rules in December 2017, but they have since been held up on appeal.</p>
      <p>The rules allow an entire primary residence to be rented out when an owner or long-term tenant is away, up to 180 nights per year.</p>
