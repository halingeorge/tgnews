      <p>James Smith Cree Nation spokesman Winston McLean described the accommodations included in last year's government environmental approval as "woefully inadequate."</p>

      <h3>A Saskatchewan First Nation wants to re-open environmental consultations with the provincial government on a proposed diamond mine east of Prince Albert, with the aim of securing what it believes would be a better deal for its people.</h3>
      <p>James Smith Cree Nation spokesman Winston McLean described the accommodations included in last year’s government environmental approval as “<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/james-smith-cree-nation-considering-options-after-sask-government-greenlights-diamond-mine">woefully inadequate</a>” — but declined to say what the community plans to ask for if new consultations were to take place.</p>
      <p>“We’re pretty confident that they want to have a diamond mine in this province, and it’s not going to go ahead without our people’s interests being addressed,” McLean said Monday in an interview.</p>
      <p>“We’re hoping that they will be receptive to re-opening discussions.”</p>
      <p>McLean declined to comment on what action the community feels it could take to stop a mine from being built in the Fort a la Corne forest, and said he is not aware of another instance in which talks were re-opened after an approval was granted.</p>
      <p>Star Diamond Corp. has been working since 1995 on building a mine in the forest. Last week, Rio Tinto Exploration Canada Inc. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/rio-tinto-exercises-diamond-mine-options-early">confirmed its plan to acquire a 60-per-cent stake in the project for $75 million</a> through a two-year-old option agreement.</p>
      <p>The provincial government gave the proposed open-pit mine its environmental approval last year contingent on a portion of the forest being reserved for band members’ use, as well as annual payment of $161,250 to fund community and environmental programs.</p>
      <p>The First Nation is also expected to be offered an agreement for “training, jobs and business opportunities” if the project proceeds. Impact benefit agreements are typically signed only after it is decided that a project should go into production.</p>
      <p>“Rio Tinto will continue to engage with First Nations groups to keep them informed on activities for the … exploration project,” a spokesman for the Melbourne, Australia-based company said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>“We will work collaboratively with the local communities while we continue with exploration work and the results will be used to decide if the project will advance to further studies.”</p>
      <p>In a separate statement, a spokeswoman for Star Diamond said Rio Tinto and James Smith Cree Nation “continue to work together to establish long-term, mutually beneficial, cooperative and respectful relationship with respect to activities and the project.”</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan Environment Minister Dustin Duncan said the four-year environmental approval has “been a very extensive and comprehensive process.” The approval is <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/government-grants-environmental-approval-for-prince-albert-area-diamond-mine">thought to be the longest set of consultations on a proposed project</a> in the province’s history.</p>
      <p>“We believe that duty to consult has been fulfilled. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/there-will-be-no-mine-until-our-interests-are-satisfied-investors-frustrated-as-diamond-mine-talks-between-province-first-nation-stall">Doesn’t mean that everybody’s going to be happy with the outcome</a>, but we’ve followed the process,” Duncan said at the time the province issued its approval.</p>
      <p>A Ministry of Environment spokesman echoed Duncan’s comments in a brief statement, saying the environmental assessment was “thorough” and included “in-depth consultation” prior to the decision to approve the project.</p>
      <p>“The potential impacts of the project were assessed as part of the environmental assessment process, and can be addressed by proponent commitments through terms and conditions of the ministerial approval, and in permits and licences required for the project,” Darby Semeniuk said in the statement.</p>
      <p>McLean said James Smith Cree Nation welcomes the change in ownership of the project, and has a better relationship with the Anglo-Australian mining giant than with Saskatoon-based Star Diamond, formerly known as Shore Gold Inc.</p>
      <p>While Rio Tinto plans to continue exploring the site before making any decision to bring <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/star-diamond-corp-shaves-510m-from-cost-of-building-mine-near-prince-albert">the $1.4-billion mine into production</a>, industry insiders have suggested its involvement means there is a real chance the project will come to fruition.</p>
      <p>McLean acknowledged that the mine is an opportunity for James Smith Cree Nation, but said it is also a threat to band members’ use of the forest for hunting, fishing and trapping — which has cultural as well as economic significance.</p>
      <p>“Nobody should get their hopes up in terms of a diamond mine tomorrow, especially until our people’s interests have been addressed.”</p>
