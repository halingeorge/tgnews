      <h1>Bethenny Frankel Sells Her SoHo Loft</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:28:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.architecturaldigest.com/" target="_blank">Joyce Chen</a></address>
      <p>Bethenny Frankel's SoHo loft is officially off the market. The former <i>Real Housewives of New York City</i> star originally listed the two-bedroom condo for $5 million in early 2017, but had to lower the price over the last two years. It was last listed for $3.995 million, though it is unclear what the final sale price actually was.</p>
      <p>The Skinnygirl founder bought the condo in a pinch in October 2014 amidst her very public split from her now ex-husband Jason Hoppy, and she's made significant upgrades and renovations in the time since. According to the multihyphenate, that was the plan all along.</p>
      <p>“When I bought the apartment, I was in a situation where I really needed to buy something,” she told <i><a href="https://people.com/home/bethenny-frankel-puts-soho-apartment-on-market/">People</a></i> in 2017. “It was a time when I needed to get some stability for [my daughter] Bryn and myself and I needed a home for us. Our SoHo apartment is an amazing place, but I’d like a bigger place now for both of us.”</p>
      <p>The 2,392-square-foot unit features two bedrooms and two bathrooms, with the sort of luxury materials one would expect from a former <i>RHONY</i> star: walnut flooring throughout, brand-new kitchen appliances from Subzero and Miele, and a marble master bathroom.</p>
      <p>The sunken living room has 14-foot ceilings and a trio of triple-paned arched windows that stretch nearly the entire height of the walls, as well as an elegant stone-manteled wood-burning fireplace, a balcony, and a landscaped atrium. The master bedroom boasts a number of built-in shelves and cabinets, as well as a luxurious walk-in closet that is large enough to accommodate an extensive wardrobe. The master bathroom has a deep soaking tub and separate steam shower, and the second bedroom has built-in speakers.</p>
      <p>Frankel and her daughter presently reside in a 4,000-square-foot SoHo loft located right next to her Skinnygirl offices, which she snapped up in the summer of 2017. “I wasn’t even looking to move, but this was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up,” she <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/bethenny-frankel-takes-us-inside-her-newly-renovated-4000-square-foot-soho-artists-loft?mbid=synd_yahoo_rss">told <i>Architectural Digest</i></a> in May 2018. “All of a sudden I was in it.”</p>
