      <h1>Box Office: ‘Bala’ set to become Ayushmann Khurrana’s third Rs. 100 crore film</h1>

      <p>Ayushmann Khurrana’s ‘Bala’ continues its dominance at the ticket windows. The film enjoyed a fantastic second weekend and currently stands with the grand total of Rs 90.74 crore. It is set to enter the Rs 100 crore club in the coming days and will become Khurrana’s third film to achieve this milestone after ‘Badhaai Ho’ (2018) and ‘Dream Girl’ (2019).</p>
      <p>The star, who is getting acknowledgements and awards for his brave choices says that he wants to continue doing the best films he can do. “I have a lot of hunger to do the best films. It is something that drives me, motivates me to seek out good, new, disruptive cinema and better myself as an actor. They say you learn a lot through your successes and this current phase has told me that I should always push the content envelope and pick and back edgy stories because somehow my brand of cinema has become synonymous with something that’s a little left of centre.”</p>
      <p>On his successful run in showbiz, Khurrana thanked his fans saying, “It feels amazing that my films are being loved by audiences across the country. I believe this box office run is a responsibility given to me to do better work and provide better entertainment to the people of my country.” According to him, this “result is a huge validation that my choices are a perfect match to what audiences want to see in theatres.”</p>
      <p>Khurrana concluded, “It’s a great zone for me to occupy because it gives me the freedom to express myself as an artist without the pressure of playing safe to deliver success. If today, people equate my kind of cinema to good cinema, that’s all that matters to me.”</p>
