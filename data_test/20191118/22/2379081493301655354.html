      <p>(Bloomberg) — Apollo Global Management Inc. is exploring a sale of Qdoba Restaurant Corp., a Mexican food chain it acquired last year, according to Qdoba Chief Executive Officer Keith Guilbault.</p>
      <p>“We’re extremely grateful for the guidance, strategy and resources Apollo has provided,” Guilbault said in an emailed statement. “Now, as Apollo explores a potential sale, it shows the health and strength of the QDOBA brand as we continue to focus on what we do best — creating flavor that our customers love and cultivating a culture that our team members enjoy every day.”</p>
      <p>New York-based Apollo is working with advisers on a potential sale of Qdoba, which could fetch up to $550 million, including debt, according to a person familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified because information is private. It generates about $50 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, this person said.</p>
      <p>Representatives for Apollo declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Apollo closed its $305 million purchase of Qdoba from Jack in the Box Inc. in March 2018. The San Diego-based company, which does business as QDOBA Mexican Eats, has more than 750 locations in the U.S. and Canada, according to its website.</p>
      <p>Since Apollo acquired the company, it has started offering plant-based meat substitutes at its restaurants and opened a new headquarters in San Diego, according to its website.</p>
      <p>Apollo is bringing Qdoba to market after the firm’s attempt to take Chuck E. Cheese parent CEC Entertainment Inc. public via a reverse merger fell apart in July.</p>
