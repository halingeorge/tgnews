      <h1>Antonio Brown Drops New YouTube Video Passionately Speaking Out On NFL Investigation (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Antonio Brown met with the NFL last week and seriously hopes the next step from here is getting back to playing football. The NFL and Brown had a meeting that lasted eight hours concerning the sexual assault allegations filed against him back in September.</p>
      <p>Even if the interview/meeting went well, that doesn’t mean Brown will see the field again this season as his legal issues will seemingly keep him off a team for the remainder of the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the former Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots wide receiver took to Twitter over the weekend to say “It’s Sad they make us guilty til proven innocent system not for us it’s against us ! Lie on my name provide all this shame then I suppose to just return to your game.”</p>
      <p>He also dropped a video of himself training and answering whether or not he’ll play in the league again.</p>
