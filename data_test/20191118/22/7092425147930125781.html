      <p>The failed attempt occurred at Carlisles' on the Belfast Road in Ballynahinch in the early hours of Monday morning.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, detectives also probing the theft of an ATM machine in Belfast.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Richard Thornton explained: "Our investigations into both of these incidents are at a very early stage, and it is unclear at this time if they are linked.</p>
      <p>"In the first report this morning (November 18) made to police at 5.28am, it was reported a bulldozer was being used in an attempt to rip an ATM machine from the wall of a petrol station on the Belfast Road, Ballynahinch . A silver-coloured Volkswagen Passat car with a trailer was also reported at the scene.</p>
      <p>"Those involved in the attempted theft were reported to have fled the scene, empty-handed, but having caused substantial damage to the premises, and to the roof of the forecourt.</p>
      <p>"At approximately 6.55am we received a report of a car, matching the description of the Passat reported at the scene, on fire in the Queens Park area of Saintfield.</p>
      <p>"Did you capture footage of this vehicle on your dash cam? If you saw any suspicious activity, including vehicles or persons, in these areas this morning please, pick up the phone and tell us what you know.</p>
      <p>"This was a brazen and despicable attack by those involved who have caused serious disruption to the business affected and to its customers. This attack has also caused widespread disruption to people using the Belfast Road, which remains closed as we continue with our enquiries.</p>
