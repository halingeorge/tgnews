          <b>If you have a laptop with only one or two USB-C ports, you need a USB-C hub with lots of ports to expand your connectivity options.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Satechi Aluminum Multi-Port Adapter V2 is our top pick because it has all the ports you need to make your laptop more versatile.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A USB Type-C hub or dock is a great way to add more ports on your laptop or tablet, especially if you have a laptop that only has one or two USB-C ports – whether it’s a Mac, PC, or Chromebook, as well as newer iPad Pros and even select Android smartphones</p>
      <p>There are a few things to consider when you’re buying a USB-C hub. For starters, you’ll want to think about exactly how many ports you need and what kind of ports you’ll use most. For example, you might simply want more USB-A ports. Or, you might want a combination of an HDMI port, SD card reader, Ethernet port, USB-A ports, and USB-C port with power pass-through (to charge a laptop).</p>
      <p>You’ll also want to think about the size and style of the hub since it’ll be plugged into your laptop quite often. USB-C hubs can also be expensive, but you want to make sure that the hub will work perfectly and easily.</p>
      <h3>Here are the best USB-C hubs you can buy:</h3>

      <h4>The best USB-C hub overall</h4>
      <h4>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2KG0L1r">Satechi Aluminum Multi-Port Adapter V2</a> is well-designed, supports pass-through charging, and has a large variety of ports.</h4>
      <p>If you’re looking for a versatile USB-C hub and want one of the best out there, then the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KG0L1r">Satechi Aluminum Multi-Port Adapter V2</a> is the way to go. It may be a little bulky, but the trade-off is that it features a ton of ports.</p>
      <p>You’ll get three USB-A 3.0 ports, as well as one HDMI port, one USB-C port, and one Ethernet port. You’ll also get an SD card slot and a microSD card slot, so those of you who are looking for something to easily transfer data from your camera or phone will appreciate this hub. The HDMI port supports 4K monitors and the Gigabit Ethernet port can handle speeds of 10/100/1000Mbps.</p>
      <p>For those with only a single USB-C port on their laptop, this hub supports pass-through charging, so you can plug your computer’s charger into the hub’s USB-C port to charge your computer. It may not charge quite as quick as it does when you plug the charger directly into your computer, but rest assured that you can still charge your laptop with this hub.</p>
      <p>We tested it out on a MacBook Pro so we could transfer photos from an SD card and it worked like a charm. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/6/1/17413728/the-best-usb-c-hub-for-laptops-macbook-pro">The Verge</a> also considers it the best USB-C hub.</p>
      <p>The downsides are that it’s a little pricey and it only has one USB-C port, so if you’re looking for additional USB-C ports specifically, this may not be the way to go (although there aren’t many USB-C-only hubs to recommend at this time).</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Lots of ports, variety of port, nice design</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> A bit expensive, only one USB-C port</p>

      <p>Not everyone wants to spend a ton of cash on a USB hub for their computer. That, however, is where the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M6R3CPB/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_070918_best-usb-c-hubs-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07M6R3CPB&amp;amp;linkId=cc8607d6118576b78d419a89949b4e50">HooToo USB-C Adapter hub</a> comes in. It increases the number of ports on your laptop without a super high price tag.</p>
      <p>The hub has three USB-A 3.0 ports, is lightweight, and works natively with Macs and PCs. In addition, there is one SD card reader, one HDMI port that supports 4K monitors, and a USB-C port for power up to 100 watts, which is pretty remarkable considering the price.</p>
      <p>HooToo upgraded this hub with heat-reduction tech to prevent overheating, while the use of copper wiring and other metals helps to create more efficient data transfers, according to the company.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Three USB ports, card reader, HDMI port, inexpensive, lightweight and pocket-friendly design</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> USB ports on both sides of hub would have been nice</p>

      <h4>The best with cable management</h4>

      <p>The problem with living in the dongle life is, well, the dongle that sticks out like a sore thumb. Other World Computing’s second-generation <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;amp;xcust=biipgf_070918_best-usb-c-hubs&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fshop%2Fowc-usb-c-travel-dock">USB-C Travel Dock</a> neatly tucks beneath the device.</p>
      <p>The OWC USB-C Travel Dock gives you two standard USB 3.1 Type-A ports, an HDMI port to connect to an external monitor or projector, and an SD Card reader. There’s also a USB-C port that delivers power up to 100 watts, which means you can charge a laptop or tablet that the dock is connected to; it can also charge laptops faster than other hubs with power pass-through, thanks to the higher wattage. The square-block design sits neatly on any desk, making it suitable as a desktop companion as well as for travel. It’s an improvement over the first-generation model, which doesn’t have the cable storage system and its USB-C port’s power passthrough supports only up to 60 watts.</p>
      <p>As the name suggests, it’s designed for portability primarily, although most of our recommendations allow for that. We have been testing it for several months and found it to be well-made and its performance to be solid. Power is delivered consistently to a MacBook Pro, and it has no problems connecting to a 32-inch external display. It tucks nicely into our bag’s interior pocket.</p>
      <p>We wish the hub was a bit lighter and that is had at least one more USB ports. We also found the cable to be too short; because our test computer is usually elevated, the hub dangles, but this hasn’t affected performance. A microSD card slot would have been useful, but we worked around this by using an SD Card adapter.</p>
      <p>The OWC USB-C Travel Dock is relatively inexpensive, however, if you don’t need the cable management, consider our budget option. We like that OWC offers a two-year warranty on the product. – <i>Les Shu</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros</b>: Cable storage system, solid performance and reliability, 100-watt power passthrough</p>
      <p><b>Cons</b>: Short cable, only two USB-A ports</p>

      <p>If you’re looking to add some USB-A ports to your computer, then the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DFYQXY7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_070918_best-usb-c-hubs-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00XU6IMWY&amp;amp;linkId=487c4ceba372d6e4d658817e8d1e2ad7">Anker 4-port USB-C to USB 3.0 hub</a> is the way to go. The simple hub only offers four USB 3.0 Type-A ports – the ubiquitous ones you’ll find everywhere – and nothing else, but for some people, that might be all they need.</p>
      <p>With this hub, you’ll be able to connect peripherals like mice, keyboards, hard drives, and so on. This way, you can reuse your existing gear without needing to buy USB-C accessories.</p>
      <p>Another great thing about this hub is that it’s affordable. Anker makes a lot of different types of USB-C hubs, and many Business Insider employees use them with our MacBook Pros. They work well, but there are reports of failure from time to time. Anker offers an 18-month warranty period as well as a 30-day money-back guarantee if you’re unhappy.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Nice design, inexpensive</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Only one type of port</p>

      <p>Perhaps you’re looking for something to nicely complement your MacBook Pro without doing away with the computer’s sleek form-factor. If that’s the case, then the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077JWZDGL/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_070918_best-usb-c-hubs-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B077JWZDGL&amp;amp;linkId=87a7752a2fcb695f10f884383e44e473">HyperDrive 7-Port USB-C Hub</a> is a great way to go.</p>
      <p>The hub slots into a USB-C port on the side of your MacBook or MacBook Pro, giving you one USB-C port, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, a MicroSD card slot, headphone port, and two USB-A ports. The HDMI port can connect to a 4K monitor, while the USB-C port also delivers power.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the best thing about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077JWZDGL/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_070918_best-usb-c-hubs-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B077JWZDGL&amp;amp;linkId=87a7752a2fcb695f10f884383e44e473">HyperDrive 7-Port USB-C Hub</a> is that it’s sleek and stylish, and it sits flushed with the laptop (the color and material even match some MacBook Pros). While it’s designed to be plugged into the left side of the computer, it can easily be plugged into the right side instead (select higher-end MacBook Pro models), if that’s what you prefer.</p>
      <p>This is a similar pick as our <a href="https://amzn.to/2KG0L1r">overall favorite</a>, but you don’t have to deal with a hanging cable. And like the Satechi, this hub is expensive.</p>
      <p>This particular version of the HyperDrive also works with PCs, Chromebooks, and Android phones. If you want a version that is tailored for newer MacBook Pros, there’s an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0779GXWXV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_070918_best-usb-c-hubs-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0779GXWXV&amp;amp;linkId=3ccf7024f25269762c472d609aebcb53">8-in-2 HyperDrive</a> that offers two USB-C ports.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Nice design, lots of ports, blends in with MacBook laptops</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Expensive, no Ethernet port</p>

      <h4>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2CpebZq">Satechi Type-C Aluminum Monitor Stand Hub</a> for iMac is well-designed and offers a good selection of ports.</h4>
      <p>The iMac is a great computer, but it can be a little tricky to access all the ports on the computer because they’re located on the back. The <a href="https://amzn.to/2CpebZq">Satechi Type-C Aluminum Monitor Stand Hub</a> for iMac solves that problem by putting the ports front-and-center.</p>
      <p>The monitor stand is the perfect size for the iMac, so you can place your iMac on top of it and gain access to ports without needing to swivel the computer around. The hub also fits perfectly with Apple’s design sensibilities, and you can choose between silver and space gray.</p>
      <p>When it comes to ports, the hub offers three USB 3.0 ports, USB-C port, SD and microSD card slots, and a headphone jack. It’s a solid lineup and should make day-to-day access to your computer’s ports a lot more convenient.</p>
      <p>The hub isn’t perfect. For example, a few more USB-C ports would have been nice, and it is a little expensive. Still, we’ve been using the hub with a Mac Mini for some time and find it to be well worth the price. It’s not strictly for the iMac, either.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Well-designed, good port selection</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> More USB-C ports would be nice, expensive</p>
