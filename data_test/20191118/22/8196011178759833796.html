      <p>Events in Cardiff tomorrow will dictate the identity of Ireland’s opponents in the Euro 2020 Path B play-off semi-final match on Tuesday, March 26.</p>
      <p>If Wales beat Hungary in their last Group E match, Mick McCarthy’s men will fly to Slovakia next spring hoping to reach a play-off decider five days later against another opponent, most likely either Bosnia-Herzegovina or Northern Ireland. And that showdown could be staged in Dublin, depending on how UEFA’s draw for home advantage in the four play-off finals works out on Friday this week.</p>
      <p>But if Wales end level with Hungary and Slovakia beat Azerbaijan, Ireland will go to Cardiff – a repeat of the do-or-die fixture decided by James McClean’s goal two years ago.</p>
      <p>Should Wales suffer defeat by Hungary, an already complex situation will grow even more complicated, with either Wales, Slovakia, or Northern Ireland being elevated to the Path A play-off pool of four by means of a draw.</p>
      <p>If Wales are bumped up to Path A, Slovakia will host Ireland and Bosnia-Herzegovina will welcome Northern Ireland. If Slovakia are removed from Path B, Ireland will face Wales in Cardiff. And if Michael O’Neill’s team leave the Path B equation, Ireland will travel to Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>
      <p>While Ireland beat Bosnia-Herzegovina in a two-leg play-off tie to qualify for Euro 2016, UEFA’s 2020 regulations provide for one-match semi-finals. Away goals do not count double, and extra time and, if needed, penalty kicks will be used.</p>
      <p>The Bosnians leaked 17 goals in 10 Group J matches, losing five times (twice against Italy, and away to Finland, Armenia and Greece). But Miralem Pjanic (Juventus) and Edin Dzeko (Roma) carry a threat, and they helped to achieve a 4-1 home win against qualifiers Finland.</p>
      <p>Wales are unbeaten at home ahead of tonight’s clash with Hungary, having beaten Slovakia (1-0) and Azerbaijan (2-1) and drawn with Croatia (1-1). They lost in Croatia and Hungary.</p>
      <p>Slovakia have not beaten Ireland in five attempts (including four competitive matches). In the current campaign, their home record is one win (2-0 vs. Hungary), one draw (1-1 vs. Wales) and one defeat (0-4 vs. Croatia).</p>
      <p>Only two things are certain. Ireland will play away from home in their semi-final match next March. And Ireland’s two previous experiences of single-match play-off ties ended in defeat: 0-1 vs Spain (Paris, 1965) and 0-2 vs The Netherlands (Anfield, December 1995).</p>
