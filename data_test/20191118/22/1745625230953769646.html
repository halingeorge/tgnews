      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/cindy-kimberly/">Cindy Kimberly</a> is flooring her over 5.8 million fans in the most recent photo she shared on her Instagram account. In the hot new snapshot, Cindy stunned in a look that was a far cry from how she normally appears.</p>
      <p>In the photo, the model could be seen posing outside in an artistic shot, leaning up against a lightly pink painted wall with a movie poster on it. Cindy wowed her fans by debuting a brand new blond hairstyle that included bangs. Her long locks were parted in the middle and fell all the way down to her chest in voluminous waves. The model looked straight into the camera for the photo op, rocking a stunning application of makeup that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and bright red lipstick.</p>
      <p>The bombshell put her killer figure on full display, rocking a tight-fitting, long-sleeved black zip-up. On the bottom, the social media sensation sported a pair of tight black spandex that she tucked her shirt into. Cindy did not specifically mention to fans where she was in the shot but she credited retailer Revolve for her sexy ensemble while joking that she almost dropped her croissant.</p>

      <p>“This is inspiring me to go blonde [sic] but I just recently dyed my hair blue so I can’t. Looking gorgeous as always,” a second Instagram user wrote, adding a blue heart emoji.</p>
      <p>“My wife always lookin fine, I love you so much,” gushed a third fan.</p>
