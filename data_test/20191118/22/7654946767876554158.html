      <p>GODDARD, Kan. — Authorities discovered a camel, a cow and a donkey roaming together along a Kansas road in a grouping reminiscent of a Midwestern Christmas Nativity scene.</p>
      <p>The Goddard Police Department asked for help Sunday in locating the owners of the “three friends traveling together (towards a Northern star).”</p>
      <p>Police <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPoliceDepartment/photos/a.1532067436832650/2659808440725205/?type=3&amp;amp;theater">said in a Facebook post</a> that if they couldn’t find the owners, they would be “halfway toward a live Nativity this Christmas season.”</p>
      <p>Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Lt. Tim Meyers says the animals belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park.</p>
      <p>One person who replied to the Facebook post inquired, “Are there 3 wise looking men near?” Another speculated that they “may lead you to the Second Coming.”</p>
      <p>Goddard is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Wichita.</p>
