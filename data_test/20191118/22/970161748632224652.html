      <p>What happens when you mix ex-decathlete <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> and former rugby union player <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> with a bucket of cold shower water in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> jungle?</p>
      <p>Pure comedy, clearly.</p>
      <p>For the first episode since arriving at camp, the former professional athletes hilariously try to take a shower but the cold water is too unbearable.</p>
      <p>James was first up out of all of the camp mates to have a shower and he initially looked cool, calm and collected.</p>
      <p>But after he got a face full of freezing cold water, he let out a scream.</p>
      <p>Cut to him telling the camera about the experience: ‘Brisk, is what I would describe it as.’</p>
      <p>Then it was Caitlyn’s turn, who rocked up in a two-piece black bikini and hair tied up in a ponytail.</p>

      <p>But as soon as the water hit her body, she closed her eyes and screamed.</p>
      <p>‘It was just so refreshing,’ Caitlyn said, after getting water in her mouth and coughing up a storm.</p>

      <p>During tonight’s episode, Caitlyn also opened up about living her life in the spotlight while appearing on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians/">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a>, as well as coming to terms with her transgender identity.</p>
      <p>She told her camp mates: ‘I thought I was gonna transition before I was 40.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t want to be an old chick but this is the latter 80’s and I never felt like I fitted in anywhere.’</p>
      <p>Then James responded in support: ‘I think the biggest thing about your thing is all those people thinking about not being able to do it is the fact they should feel comfortable to do it however hard it is because 99% of the time it’ll work out alright.’</p>

      <p>Caitlyn responded: ‘All my life I struggled with all of those.’</p>
