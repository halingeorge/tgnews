      <h1>RBNZ's Hawkesby: Economy is in good shape</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:40:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) Christian Hawkesby, Assistant Governor/GM Economics, Financial Markets and Banking, has been crossing the wires again, in addition to earlier comments whereby an August rate cut has been described as a means to avoiding more later.</p>
      <h3>Additional comments: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>August cut did not mean something bad had happened.</li>
        <li>The economy is in good shape and we are trying to keep it there.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Earlier in today's Asian opening hours, Hawkesby said, "We need to keep rates at a low level for some time,' adding, "Global risks are still to the downside."</p>
      <h4>FX implications: </h4>
      <p>There has been little to zero reaction to the comments today as the price of NZD/USD balances over the support of slightly bullish 21 and 50-day moving averages with price oscillating around 0.64 the figure. There is a focus on US and Chinese trade relations on an otherwise dormant domestic calendar for the week ahead. </p>
