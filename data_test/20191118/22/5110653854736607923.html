      <p>For the first time this season, Chiefs and Chargers fans will have to scan their TV channels for ESPN in order to watch their teams play.

      <p>The Chiefs, technically the road team for Monday night's game in Mexico, are 4 1/2-point favorites over the Chargers.</p>
      <p>Estadio Azteca, which is 7,201 feet above sea level, will host a regular-season NFL game for the fourth time (2005, 2016 and 2017). It was supposed to host a Monday night clash between the Chiefs and Rams last season, but concerns over the quality of the field forced the NFL to move the game to Los Angeles.</p>
