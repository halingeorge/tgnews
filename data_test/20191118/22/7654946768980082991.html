      <p>Cops have upped patrols in Bay Ridge after vandals struck at least 52 cars in two incidents this month, officials confirmed Monday.</p>
      <p>The response comes after someone <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/tires-slashed-on-over-30-cars-in-bay-ridge-overnight/">scratched up and slashed tires</a> on 32 cars on Shore Road near 72nd Street over the weekend.</p>
      <p>A similar incident was reported to cops on Oct. 18, when another 20-30 cars were found just blocks away on Shore Road with flattened tires and keyed exteriors, according to police.</p>
      <p>An NYPD spokesperson said the commanding officer of the local precinct “has deployed Neighborhood Coordination Officers, patrol officers and anti-crime personnel to the area to conduct patrols to monitor the area and search for a suspect(s) during every tour.”</p>
