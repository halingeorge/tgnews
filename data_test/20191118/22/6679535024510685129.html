      <h1>Dalit man’s family to receive compensation from Punjab government</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:17:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Punjab government on Monday offered to pay compensation of ₹20 lakh and a government job to the deceased Dalit man’s wife and free education for his children. The family of 37-year-old Jagmel Singh who was mercilessly thrashed and forced to drink urine earlier this month ended their protest after the announcement.</p>
      <p>The family had refused to allow the post mortem of the body till their demand of ₹50 lakh compensation and a government job for the victim’s wife were met.</p>
      <p>Sandeep Sandhu, political secretary to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, said a compensation of ₹20 lakh including ₹ 8.15 lakh provided under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act will be given to the next of kin.</p>
      <p>Sandhu, who held a meeting with the victim’s family here, further said that a government job would also be given to a family member of Jagmel.</p>
      <p>Besides, an Additional Director General of Police-rank officer will conduct a probe to find out if there was any lapse on the part of police in this case and a challan against all the four accused would be submitted within seven days, he said.</p>
      <p>The government will also bear the education expenditure of his three children till their graduation. He further said that a sum of ₹1.25 lakh would also be given for repair of their house.</p>
      <p>On October 21, the victim, who was a resident of Changaliwala village in Punjab’s Sangrur district, got into an altercation with one Rinku and some other persons. The dispute was resolved with the intervention of villagers, the police said.</p>
      <p>Before his death, the victim had told the police that on November 7, Rinku called him to his house where the two talked about the issue. He had alleged that he was then thrashed by four persons with a stick and an iron rod after being tied to a pillar and was forced to drink urine when he asked for water.</p>
      <p>After the incident, the opposition parties have attacked the Congress government over “barbaric treatment” being meted out to Dalits in the state. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said a “rule of jungle” was prevalent in the state.</p>
