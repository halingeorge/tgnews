      <p>John McDonnell says it's clear whose side Boris Johnson is on: "the billionaires, the bankers and big, exploitative corporations".</p>
      <p>The shadow chancellor said Labour believes "<a href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/general-election-2019/"><b>a new business model is needed</b></a>" as he accused the prime minister of allowing the country's “super rich” to buy access to “tax breaks and corporate giveaways”.</p>
      <p>In a speech in Westminster, he said a government led by Jeremy Corbyn would look to offer employees more of a say and make businesses a "partnership" with those involved.</p>
      <p>"At the heart is our belief that every business should be a partnership between employees and customers, management and shareholders for the long-term success of the enterprise," said Mr McDonnell.</p>

      <p>Mr McDonnell said a Labour government would look to introduce a 20:1 pay ratio in large companies whereby someone on the living wage of about £16,000 a year would see no one in the boardroom earning more than £350,000 a year.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell said he would look to give employees a strong stake in the business they work for.</p>
      <p>He said: "In line with our commitment to building a stakeholder economy we aim to broaden the ownership base of UK businesses to give workers more of a stake in their company.</p>
      <p>"There is evidence to show that this not only advances long-term decision making but also boosts productivity.</p>
      <p>"We have announced the introduction of Inclusive Ownership Funds in which larger companies will be required to transfer 1% of their shares into an employee fund until the fund owns 10% of the company.</p>
      <p>"Shares would be owned collectively by employees with dividend payments distributed up to a maximum of £500 per employee per year."</p>

      <p>Companies that fail to tackle climate change could be delisted from the London Stock Exchange, Mr McDonnell further warned.</p>
      <p>Delisting occurs when a stock is removed from a stock exchange and is usually prompted by a company failing to meet the requirements of the exchange.</p>
      <p>Companies already have to meet rules set by the London Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority and Labour is proposing amending the Corporate Governance Code to put in place a minimum standard to listing relating to "evidence of necessary action being taken to tackle climate change".</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell said: "It will be for, basically, those companies themselves to bring forward their proposals and plans - exactly what sort of proposals they'll be, how effective they'll be.</p>
      <p>"And then during the listing process, they'll be assessed about how successful they are either performing or how successful their plans will be.</p>
      <p>"On that basis, just as with the rest of the code that there is, they'll then be assessed and determined if they can be listed."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/general-election-2019/"><b>opposition party</b></a> has calculated that by 2023/24, the Conservatives will have handed out “tax breaks and corporate giveaways” worth almost £100 billion since coming to power in 2010.</p>
      <p>Labour said they included £86 billion in corporation tax cuts, £5.6 billion in reductions to inheritance tax and £5.5 billion in cuts to capital gains tax.</p>

      <p>The Conservatives said the “top 1%” were paying a greater share of taxes than at any time under the last Labour government while tax receipts from business were at an all-time high.</p>
      <p>Treasury Minister Simon Clarke said: “Corbyn’s Labour have revealed their true colours. They want to stop people from passing on their family homes to their children after they die.</p>
      <p>“Rather than helping people to succeed, they want to take away your family home in higher taxes. Their plans would not hit billionaires – they would overwhelmingly hurt hard-pressed families.”</p>
