      <p>Helen Flanagan has spoken out over her experience in the I'm A Celebrity jungle as the 2019 series starts - and it doesn't make great hearing.</p>
      <p>The Coronation Street star starred in the ITV reality show in 2012.</p>
      <p>And Helen, who is in a relationship with ex-Aston Villa star Scott Sinclair, watched as the show returned to our screens on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The Rosie Webster actress admitted she says it brought back some terrifying memories for her.</p>
      <p> Speaking to fans on Instragram Helen said: "Just the thought even when Ant and Dec come on and say 'we've got this challenge' just gives me the fear.</p>
      <p>"I remember when they used to try to explain things to me about the trials, I'd panic because I would be so scared.</p>

      <p>"I wouldn't even process what they were telling me because I would be so worked up.</p>
      <p>"I remember I did this trial, it was vile.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I hate crocodiles.</p>
      <p>"I had to go under water and I had to go get these stars, but I forgot I had to get them with my mouth.</p>

      <p>"But I was so panicky and worked up, I just didn't think."</p>
      <p>Watching the first challenge she said: "I'm so happy right now that I'm in my dressing gown at home and that is not me.</p>
      <p>"Honestly though, watching that height challenge literally makes me feel sick."</p>
