      <h1>Russia returns three seized Ukrainian ships</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia">Russia</a> returned <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-ship-fires-on-ukrainian-vessels-in-black-sea-ukraine-says">three naval ships captured</a> from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukraine</a> last year in the Kerch Strait, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Monday.</p>
      <p>The Russian Coast Guard seized two gun boats and a tug boat in November 2018 as the vessels maneuvered near the strait, which runs between Russia and Crimea, annexed from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard fired several shots and detained 24 Ukranian sailors for 10 months following the seizure. They were returned as part of a prisoner exchange.</p>
      <p>Ukraine has urged for the return of the ships as a positive gesture ahead of a scheduled Dec. 9  meeting in Paris to discuss a four-way peace agreement on eastern Ukraine.</p>
