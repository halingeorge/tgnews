      <p>Kelowna RCMP still in need of help to locate Kelowna teens Trinity Erickson and Michael Campbell, who have both been reported missing.</p>
      <p>Police <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/rcmp-asking-for-help-in-finding-missing-kelowna-teen/it67671">originally reported Trinity Erickson, 14, missing in a media release issued on Nov. 15</a>, and now Michael Campbell, 14, is also missing.<br/><br/>Erickson and Campbell were last seen Nov. 14 at their separate residences.</p>
      <p>RCMP say there is nothing to indicate foul play at this time and police believe that Erickson and Campbell are travelling together.</p>
      <p>Information suggests they may be in the Armstrong area.</p>
      <p>Erickson is decribed as an Indigenous female, 5'5" tall, 150 lbs. with long dyed blonde hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing pyjamas but it’s presumed that she has changed her clothing.</p>
      <p>Campbell is described as a Caucasian male, 6'2' tall, 150 lbs. with short blond hair and brown eyes.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on the whereabouts of the missing persons is urged to contact local police or Crimestoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).</p>
