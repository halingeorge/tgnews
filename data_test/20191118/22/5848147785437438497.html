      <h1>Plan for tax-deductible child care is on the table, but there is a catch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:54:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/samantha/" target="_blank">Samantha Maiden</a></address>
      <p>Families would be able to claim child care costs of up to $60,000 a year as a tax deduction under a proposal to be launched by Liberal MP Dave Sharma on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But there’s a catch – it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy.</p>
      <p>It’s a debate that has raged for decades – would tax deductibility encourage more women to head back to work and encourage productivity?</p>
      <p>But with <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/08/04/morrison-government-childcare-changes-verdict/">current rebates for childcare</a> covering up to 90 per cent of the cost of care for low-income families, many experts have traditionally argued tax deductibility only benefits the rich.</p>
      <p>New research by the University of New South Wales, <i>(Un)taxing Child-care</i>, has sought to test that assumption, proposing that parents be offered a choice between the current arrangements or instead receive a tax deduction for child-care expenditures of up to $60,000 a year.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“By construction, this ensures that no household is worse off under our proposed reform,” the report states.</p>
      <p>“They can always stick with their current subsidy if they so choose.</p>
      <p>“Only households that would be better off under the tax-deductibility option would choose to avail themselves of that option.”</p>
      <p>The results are surprising because the report has found even parents with a combined income of $55,000 a year could be better off by up to $600 a year.</p>

      <p>However, the biggest benefits go to families with a combined income of $280,000 a year or more who could slash their combined taxable income to $220,000.</p>
      <p>Under the proposal, a family that could afford to pay a nanny $60,000 a year could split the cost 50:50 between two working parents as a tax deduction.</p>
      <p>Each parent would then be able to reduce their taxable income by $30,000.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The plan would represent a windfall gain if it was extended to cover nannies and in-home care, which is not covered by the existing childcare rebate system for most families.</p>
      <p>“In addition to recognising child care as a legitimate work-related tax deduction, our proposal is designed to give parents the choice to increase their labour force participation,” the report states.</p>
      <p>“A tax-deductible child care option gives parents who want to return to the workforce, or work more hours, the ability to do so at an affordable cost.”</p>
      <p>However, the report’s authors Rosalind Dixon, Richard Holden and Melissa Vogt recognise that tax deductibility offers little benefits to low-income earners.</p>
      <p>“An obvious potential objection to our two-pronged approach is that it would disproportionately benefit high-income earners,” Professor Holden said.</p>
      <p>“We argue, however, that this ignores the significant potential benefits of the policy for Australian families in the second-, third- and fourth-income quintiles; the true nature of the policy (as focused on worker productivity rather than welfare); and the powerful gender equality and fairness arguments in favour of the policy.”</p>
      <p>To test the theory, the report authors commissioned Dr Ben Phillips to model the options.</p>
      <p>He found the policy would leave more than 205,000 households better off, representing one in five of households with children.</p>
      <p>The average couple with children would be $618 per annum better off.</p>
      <p>“Although households in the top quintile of the income distribution benefit the most on average with an average benefit of $1080 per annum, those in the second quintile (the bottom 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the income distribution) are on average $626 per annum better off. This represents a 1.9 per cent increase in disposal income,” the report states.</p>
      <p>The Productivity Commission has previously recommended against making child care costs tax deductible, on the basis that it is not an effective means of support for lower- and middle-income families.</p>
      <p>It is also viewed as non-transparent, inefficient, inequitable, inconsistent with established tax-deductibility principles, and unsustainable.</p>
      <p>“An experienced nanny can easily cost $35 per hour, amounting to over $80,000 for similar hours to long day care,” the report claims.</p>
      <p>“The $60,000 cap for legitimate, work-related, out-of-pocket expenses strikes a balance between recognising the high cost of child care and putting some limits on overly expensive gold-plated nanny options.”</p>
