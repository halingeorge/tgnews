      <p>Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway were strapped into cages filled with 30,000 cockroaches in the first gruelling I'm A Celebrity Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>The pair were picked for the Bugged Out challenge by the public.</p>
      <p>The stomach-churning task saw the campers strapped on their backs in perspex cages 20 metres in the air.</p>
      <p>Each cage contained coloured balls which the stars had to drop into a moving basket below, with each ball representing a meal for camp. While they struggled with the balls, the cages were filled with jungle critters.</p>
      <p>Before they started, Jenner quipped that viewers must have realised that everyone in Snake Rock was hungry and "needed an American to come in and save the day".</p>

      <p>"I feel the weight of this entire country on my shoulders," she joked.</p>
      <p>A terrified Garraway said she was "concentrating on surviving" as the pair got in their boxes.</p>
      <p>She screamed as the cockroaches, crickets, rats and mealworms tumbled into the cage, shouting: "I don't know what to do, I can't think. They're going up my noo-noo."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, by the end of the trial both women had managed to drop two balls into the basket, making a total of four meals for camp.</p>
      <p>"Thank God, thank God," said Garraway as the klaxon signalled it was over.</p>
      <p>"That was so much more disturbing than I thought it would be. It's a confined box which I find really scary, it's up very high, and then you've got everything you've ever been scared of in one place," she said later.</p>
      <p>Many took to twitter to say how unfair they found it.</p>
      <p>Michelle Mackintosh said: " <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ImACeleb">#ImACeleb</a> that bounced out that’s not fair!! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BushtuckerTrial">#BushtuckerTrial</a> "</p>
      <p>@prabhzii_x said: "Lowkey this challenge was rigged. Caitlyn got two in and they bounced out. Not fair. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ImACeleb">#ImACele</a> b"</p>
      <p>Alicia said: "Caitlyn got at least 4 more there and they bounced back. Not fair!!!!!"</p>
      <p>And Jack Walker said: "WHAT THE WHAT THE BALL JUMPED OUT THAT'S SO NOT FAIR."</p>
