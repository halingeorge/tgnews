      <p>But he fears invoking Fifa’s five-day rule would be a mistake.</p>

      <p>English Premier League men Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney and Ryan Fraser are missing for the Kazakhstan clash.</p>
      <p>Clarke is satisfied they have genuine injuries — but would fight his corner if he felt clubs were leaning on their players to pull out.</p>
      <p>Clarke said: “As you probably noticed from my short time at Kilmarnock, I don’t mind a fight if I have to fight, as long as it’s for the right reason.</p>
      <p>“If I do have to have a fight, I’ll face it head on. I don’t shirk away from it.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think I’m a soft character. If I need to be strong, I’ll be strong. But for the moment I don’t see any value in it.”</p>
      <p>Clarke could use the Fifa rule book to stop players from playing for their clubs within five days of internationals.</p>
      <p>But he added: “It becomes a case of not wanting to cut off your nose to spite your face.</p>
      <p>“You have to be in a position where you can get your best players. You don’t want to cause upset between players, clubs and international bosses.</p>
      <p>“I also have to take it at face value that every call-off is an injury call-off.</p>
      <p>“The only one which was for personal reasons this time was Matt Phillips. Everyone else was flagged up as an injury.</p>
      <p>“Of course you don’t want to harm the relationship between players and their clubs.</p>
      <p>“It’s easy to say ‘invoke the five-day rule’ — but I’m not sure there are any winners when you do that. It puts the player in a difficult position."</p>
      <p>Clarke would also love to see the SPFL help Scotland qualify for the Euros by imposing a fixtures shutdown the weekend before the first March play-off clash.</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Rod Petrie appealed for that to happen at the weekend.</p>
      <p>But as SunSport revealed league chiefs are struggling to find a way to do that without causing a fixture pile-up.</p>
      <p>Clarke admits he’s now planning to go into the vital clashes without being able to get his squad together for a week.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m going to have three training sessions to get them back on the bike and ready to go.</p>
      <p>“It’s not a lot but, on the back of what we’ve done previously, then I hope it will be enough.</p>
      <p>“I can’t remember if I actually said I wanted a cancellation of fixtures — I don’t think I did.</p>
      <p>“All we are asking for is for a little bit of common sense to come in on that weekend.</p>
      <p>“The flip side of that is that I don’t want Rangers or Celtic to get knocked out of the Europa League before then.</p>
      <p>“But if they are playing on the Thursday night the previous week, then there’s nothing we can do about that.</p>
      <p>“So you have to respect all sides. It’s probably something to speak more about after Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>“It’s better to concentrate on the game on Tuesday night.”</p>
