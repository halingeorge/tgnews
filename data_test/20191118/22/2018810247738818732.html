      <p>In 2005's <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, Ayumi Ito first voiced Tifa Lockhart and since then, has continued to be the character’s Japanese voice. Naturally, she will be returning for next year’s <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i>, but sadly, she has recently received threats of violence.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sankei.com/affairs/news/191115/afr1911150029-n1.html"><i>The Sankei News</i></a> reports that earlier this summer, a woman in her twenties allegedly sent threats to Ito’s talent agency website, writing, “I hate her [Ito] so much I want to kill her” and “I’m going to stab her in the back of her hand with all my might.” This threat was reportedly regarding Ito’s participation in a preview showing for a live-action drama. Besides Tifa, Ito acts in feature films and TV shows.</p>
      <p>That same month, a man in his 30s sent threats to a game company, reporting writing that he wanted the character Ito was voicing to be recast. <i>The Sankei News</i> does not disclose the name of the company; <a href="https://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/20191116/sca19111605020001-n1.html"><i>Sanspo</i></a>, however, lists the company as the producer of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series. The man also allegedly wrote, “[She] makes me want to stab [her] in the eyes and gouge them out with a knife.”</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://this.kiji.is/568267106438890593?c=39546741839462401"><i>Kyodo News</i></a>, neither the man and the woman were acquaintances. Charges have been filed in both cases.</p>
