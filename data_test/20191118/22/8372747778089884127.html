      <p>Amid mass speculation on the president's health, the White House released a statement from President Donald Trump's physician saying that Trump's physical evaluation on Saturday was routine, and that Trump was not treated for any acute or urgent medical issues.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Trump made an unexpected and unannounced visit to Walter Reed Medical Center. Trump previous;y had an annual checkup in February. Fueling the speculation, Trump has previously announced planned checkups, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/politics/trump-physical-walter-reed-protocol-routine-presidential-visit/index.html">CNN</a> reported that it is protocol for Walter Reed staff to be informed of a VIP's arrival.</p>
      <p>"Despite some of the speculation, the President has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues," Dr. Sean P. Conley wrote in a memo. "Specifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations."</p>
