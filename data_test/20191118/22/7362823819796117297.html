      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado">Colorado</a> rancher Patrick Frazee was convicted of murder Monday in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/kelsey-berreth-murder-trial-patrick-frazee">the killing of 29-year-old fiancee Kelsey Berreth</a>, after prosecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat while their 1-year-old daughter was in a nearby room, and then burned her body.</p>
      <p>He was found guilty on a total of six counts: two counts of first-degree murder, one count of tampering with a body, and three counts of solicitation to commit murder, as <a href="https://kdvr.com/2019/11/18/patrick-frazee-found-guilty-of-murder-for-killing-fiancee-kelsey-berreth/">KDVR</a> reported.</p>
      <p>A judge later sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors didn’t seek the death penalty.</p>

      <p>The victim’s body hasn’t been found, and Frazee was convicted with little physical evidence.</p>
      <p>Berreth, a 29-year-old flight instructor, was last seen shopping with the couple’s daughter last Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Before the punishment was formally handed down, Berreth's family and others impacted by her death told Judge Scott Sells how her death had affected them.</p>

      <p>Joseph Moore, who said he considered Frazee to be like a stepson, testified that when he asked Frazee how Berreth was doing in April 2018, he told him that he had figured out a way to kill her and get away with it.</p>
      <p>Moore said Frazee said, “No body, no crime.”</p>
      <p>He said Frazee would repeat that phrase to him several times over the summer and fall in 2018.</p>
      <p>Moore said Frazee was shocked after Berreth’s disappearance garnered attention in media around the country.</p>
      <p>“He’s like, ‘Man, if I had known it was going to blow up this big, I never would have ...’ And he stopped. He did not finish that sentence,” Moore testified.</p>

      <p>Frazee’s on-again-off-again girlfriend, Krystal Lee, testified that her lover asked her to help clean up the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">murder scene</a>.</p>
      <p>“He went from being someone who I loved and cared for and is one of my best friends,” she said in court in early November, as the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/06/kelsey-berreth-murder-patrick-frazees-trial-krystal-lee-kenney-testimony/">Denver Post</a> reported. “He said his little girl was being abused. I know it was wrong, but I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t make the right decisions.”</p>
      <p>Frazee declined to testify, and his lawyers didn’t call any witnesses of their own.</p>

      <p>Berreth’s parents argued in a wrongful-death lawsuit that they believed Frazee wanted full custody of the couple’s daughter. She now lives with them.</p>
