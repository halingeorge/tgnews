      <h1>If I touched the Moon, what would it feel like?</h1>

      <p>Twelve people have walked on the Moon since humans landed there 50 years ago, but no one has ever directly touched its surface.</p>
      <p>Those astronauts wore spacesuits outside the lander.</p>
      <p>No one ever took off a glove or a boot while standing on the Moon.</p>

      <p>“Once we got inside and took off our suits and gloves, we did have some lunar dust on the floor, and rocks that were not bagged,” <i>Apollo</i> astronaut Charlie Duke, who walked on the Moon in 1972, called to tell me.</p>
      <p>“On the way home, I collected the rocks floating around the spacecraft. One would come floating by, and I just picked it up and put it in my garment pocket. When I got back, I stuck them in a little jar that was about the size of a prescription bottle, and then I turned them back in to NASA.”</p>
      <p>Touching lunar rocks inside a spacecraft, or <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/long-journey-our-lu">in a museum</a>, is one thing; removing a glove and exposing yourself to the vacuum of space is another.</p>
      <p>In science fiction, terrible things befall such astronauts: their blood boils away, their insides get sucked out.</p>
      <p>But removing a glove wouldn’t necessarily be instantly fatal.</p>
      <p>For the most part, human skin is tough enough to handle brief exposure to a vacuum. If you had a custom spacesuit with a seal around your forearm, you could probably remove your glove during a moonwalk without suffering permanent damage.</p>

      <p>It definitely wouldn’t be comfortable. In 1960, during a high-altitude balloon test, Air Force Colonel Joe Kittinger’s pressure glove sprang a leak, exposing his right hand to near-vacuum conditions for several hours.</p>
      <p>His hand swelled up and went numb, but he suffered no permanent damage.</p>
      <p>That’s how the vacuum would feel. What about the Moon? Is it hot or cold?</p>
      <p>It depends on where you’re standing.</p>
      <p>On Earth, the hottest sun-baked rocks might reach 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but on the moon – where the sun stays visible for weeks at a time, it never gets cloudy, and there’s no breeze to carry away the heat – it gets even hotter.</p>
      <p><i>Apollo 16</i> landed in the lunar morning, when sun was low in the sky, but as the sun rose the ground heated up.</p>
      <p>By the time they left, Mr Duke said, “the surface was well over 200 degrees.”</p>
      <p>The dark night side, with two weeks of darkness and no insulating blanket of air, gets colder than Antarctica in the dead of winter.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, the temperature of the dust would not be a huge danger to your hand.</p>
      <p>Lunar dust is a great insulator – it’s full of hollows and crevices, and the lack of air prevents heat from flowing from one part of the soil to another (or to your skin).</p>
      <p>Based on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103516304869">measurements of the lunar soil</a> and NASA guidelines on <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20100020960">skin contact with hot objects</a>, you would probably be able to press a bare hand against the hottest lunar soil without feeling uncomfortably warm.</p>
      <p>But if your hand hit a rock, you might find yourself yanking it back in pain.</p>
      <p>It’s like when you take hot clothes straight out of the dryer: Even if all the parts of the clothes are the same (hot) temperature, the lightweight, insulating fabric feels pleasantly warm, whereas the dense, conductive zippers can burn you.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“There’s only one time I remember feeling the heat from the lunar surface,” Mr Duke said.</p>
      <p>The crew had left a metal frame, part of an experiment, in direct sunlight for a couple of days.</p>
      <p>“When I picked it up, I could feel the heat from that aluminium frame through my gloves. It wasn’t enough to, uh, to be worried about; you just thought, ‘This thing’s really hot’.”</p>
      <p>Moon dust may not burn you, but it’s no picnic.</p>
      <p>Like Earth sand, moon dust is effectively made of tiny glass shards, but the sharp edges have not been worn down by erosion. As a result, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/science/apollo-moon-colony-dangers.html?module=inline">can be pretty unhealthy</a>.</p>
      <p>But so long as you avoided touching rocks or metal, washed your hands afterward and didn’t mind some temporary swelling, you could probably touch the Moon and survive.</p>
      <p>Barefoot running is probably still a bad idea.</p>
