      <p>On November 16, <b>SBS</b>'s investigative television series '<b>Unanswered Questions</b>' revealed a BJ (Broadcast Jockey) under the channel name <b>'Baepon TV'</b> who claimed to be <b>Sulli</b>'s boyfriend.</p>
      <p>The BJ ran a stream shortly after her death, sobbing and stating that <i>"he would never forget her." </i></p>
      <p>However, when called into the interview for the documentary program, the BJ stated: <i>"I wanted to express my grief in another way. I didn't mean to mock or disrespect her. I feel that it's not right for celebrities to be hurt by malicious comments. As a rule, celebrities should push through those difficulties. It didn't say Sulli died because of the malicious comments. If you're going to whine about mean comments, you should stop being a celebrity." </i></p>

        <i>"You're the ugliest person I've ever seen in my life."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"What is wrong with you? Why are people like you alive?"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"So we can comment maliciously on you right?" <br/>"Attention starved and disgusting."</i>
      </p>
