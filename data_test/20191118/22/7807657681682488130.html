      <h1>Yes, you can get Disney+ on your iPhone and iPad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:27:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/author/Christine%20Chan" target="_blank">Christine Chan</a></address>
      <p><b>Best Answer:</b> Yes, you can access Disney+ on your iPhone (iOS) and iPad (iPadOS). Additionally, you can watch Disney+ on your Apple TV with tvOS, and use the iOS app to send Disney+ videos to your Apple TV. There is even the ability to download videos to your device.</p>
      <p>It's all about Disney: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU71623YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpreview.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=ZgekE5QV">Disney+</a> (From $7/month at Disney+)</p>
      <h4>So I can use either my iPhone or iPad for Disney+?</h4>
      <p>That's correct. Disney+ is available as an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/disney/id1446075923?l=en">app on the App Store</a>, and it will work on both your iPhone and iPad.</p>
      <p>Additionally, it is also accessible via the Apple TV and tvOS, as well as Mac through a desktop web browser. No matter what Apple device you are using, you'll be able to get Disney+.</p>
      <h4>You can also download videos directly on your device</h4>
      <p>Another big feature with Disney+ is the fact that you can <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-download-videos-disney-plus-ios">download movies and episodes of television series directly onto your device for offline viewing</a>. Make sure to change the download quality setting first, though, because there are Standard, Medium, and High quality settings that affect both download speed and storage needed.</p>
      <h4>What if I'm getting errors and video playback issues?</h4>
      <p>There have been some reports on <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/error-83-disney-plus">error messages</a>, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-fix-connection-issues-disney">connectivity issues</a>, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-fix-playback-issues-disney-plus">playback issues</a>. As with all streaming services, sometimes you will just need to do some basic troubleshooting steps in order to fix the problem, or even just wait if it's Disney+ server related. Either way, we know it's frustrating, so there are some things you can do to try and fix the issues you're having yourself, such as restarting your devices, restarting the app, or checking to make sure your connection speed is good.</p>
      <h4>What if I don't have an Apple device?</h4>
      <p>Don't worry! Disney+ will be available on a plethora of platforms and devices on launch.</p>

      <h4>What is Disney+?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ is the streaming service from entertainment giant, Disney. It includes most of the original Disney classic movies and TV series, as well as offerings from Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Fox, and National Geographic.</p>
      <p>In addition to the existing content for all of these, there are exclusives that you won't find on any other streaming service. These include Marvel originals, like Loki, Wanda Vision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Star Wars series The Mandalorian, and a new show with Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>
      <p>Existing Disney content on other streaming services has already been or will be pulled in the near future to get Disney+ up and running.</p>
      <h4>How much does Disney+ cost me?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ will cost $7 a month, or $70 a year. However, those who are looking to save and would also like access to Hulu (with ads) and ESPN can get a bundle for all three that costs $13 a month.</p>
      <h4>When is Disney+ available?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ launched on Nov. 12, 2019 in the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands. Austraila and New Zealand also got Disney+ on Nov. 19. It'll release on March 31, 2020 in the U.K., France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Ireland.</p>
