      <p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed a glamorous night out on Monday evening as they attended the Royal Variety Performance.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-william/">Prince William</a>, 37, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-middleton-duchess-of-cambridge/">Kate Middleton</a>, 37, wowed guests with their third appearance at the event at the London Palladium.</p>
      <p>The couple – who also attended in 2014 and 2017 – were nothing but smiles as they got to meet guests and performers.</p>
      <p>Kate wore a black lace Alexander McQueen evening gown to the variety show, while husband William opted for a traditional black tuxedo.</p>
      <p>The event is in aid of the Royal Variety Charity – or The Entertainment Artistes’ Benevolent Fund – of which Queen Elizabeth is Patron.</p>
      <p>The money raised from the show will help hundreds of entertainers throughout the UK who need help as a result of old age, ill-health, or hard times.</p>

      <p>This included Petula Clark CBE, Zizi Strallen and Charlie Stemp, who play the Bird Lady, Mary Poppins and Bert.</p>
      <p>William asked where they were performing and Zizi told him it was the Prince Edward Theatre, opening this week, according to the MailOnline.</p>
      <p>Explaining how the cast were rushing to their performance after opening the variety show, she said: ‘We are doing a show tonight’.</p>
      <p>The prince replied saying: ‘I love Mary Poppins!’</p>
      <p>Petula Clark told Kate she would have to bring their children – George, six, Charlotte, four, and Louis, one – to the show, to which she said: ‘They would love it.’</p>
      <p>However, the duchess admitted she and William had left the kids at home for the night.</p>
