      <h1>ONE PUNCH MAN: A HERO NOBODY KNOWS to Release in Late February 2020</h1>

      <p>We finally know when <b><i>One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows</i></b> is releasing! I wasn’t able to participate in the closed beta, but I know a couple of people who did (you can read <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/one-punch-man-a-hero-nobody-knows-closed-beta-impressions">one reaction here</a>), and they really enjoyed it. Well, it looks like on February 28, 2020, I will be able to try the game out for myself. In addition to the announcement of a release date, pre-orders are now available as well. If you pre-order, you’ll get early access to Saitama (Dream Version), plus you’ll get a Saitama mask and additional outfits for everyone’s favorite hero, including his jersey and black suit.</p>
      <p>Oh, also, in the new trailer below, it was revealed that Metal Knight, Stinger, and Melzargard are joining the fight.</p>
      <p><i>One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows</i> will be available for PC (via Steam), PS4, and Xbox One on February 28, 2020.</p>
