      <p>Caitlyn Jenner opened up about living a secret double life as a transgender woman hours after admitting she was seriously considering leaving I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>After a rough night at Snake Rock, 70-year-old Cait spoke to her fellow campmates about her wild life, revealing that she used to cross dress years before fully transitioning in 2015.</p>
      <p>‘I thought I was gonna transition before I was 40,’ she admitted.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t want to be an old chick but this is the latter 80s and I never felt like I fit in anywhere. I was trying to figure myself out, running around town, driving around town, doing all this kind of stuff. Nobody knew, I never met with anybody’</p>
      <p>Asked what she meant by comedian Andrew Maxwell, the parent-of-six clarified: ‘Cross dressing, running around, all that kind of stuff.</p>
      <p>‘I had, at that time, a turbo Porsche and it was like the day before Halloween and this car pulled up beside me and it’s my next door neighbour.’</p>

      <p>‘How’d you style that one out?’ asked James Haskell, to which Caitlyn replied: ‘I said I was going to a Halloween party.’</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘Then I got my first DWF, “driving while female.” You’re driving your car and some guy in a pick up truck beeps his horn and you think, “who the hell’s that” and you look over and he’s like blowing kisses.</p>
      <p>‘I’m thinking, “you poor girls go through this all the time?”’</p>
      <p>Joking that her anthem used to be Aerosmith’s Dude Looks Like A Lady (what a classic), the team all seemed to be impressed with Caitlyn’s honesty and humour, warming the TV personality up after a rough first evening.</p>
      <p>The I Am Cait star found her first night in the jungle difficult after spending the evening sleeping on the ground at Snake Rock before heading up to the confessional hut at 1am to let out her feelings</p>
      <p>‘First night in the jungle and my head is spinning,’ she tearily told the cameras.</p>

      <p>‘I’m trying to figure out whether I’m doing the right thing. I’m thinking, you’re 70 years old now, is being here the right way to use my time. Should I be home playing with my kids, playing with grandchildren?</p>
      <p>‘I mean, I’ve never quit at anything I’ve ever done, [but] I’m standing here and thinking, “maybe it’s time that you learned how to do that.”’</p>

      <p>For what it’s worth, we really hope you don’t go, Caitlyn.</p>
