      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- It is the first of its kind, and you can now stay and shop in a uniquely decorated hotel suite in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
      <p>Conrad New York Midtown has partnered with FAO Schwarz and filled an 1,800 square foot room with classic items from the toy giant.</p>
      <p>They include an iconic piano mat, huge gorilla, towering giraffe, remote controlled spider, ride along train, sweet treats, dolls, ornaments and much, much more.</p>
      <p>Everything is for sale and if you buy items, they will be waiting for you back home.</p>
      <p>Virginia Weik of Conrad New York Midtown dreamed up the idea. It was inspired by her dilemma while traveling with her own two small kids.</p>
      <p>"You have all this down time in a hotel room and they start getting into things they shouldn't," she said.</p>
      <p>By filling the suite with plenty of toys, the children keep busy and you can do some holiday shopping.</p>
      <p>The suite sleeps up to six people and is on the 50th floor. There are some extra perks, like a private tour at FAO Schwarz before the store opens to the public, and a gift certificate.</p>
      <p>The suite will stay decorated through January 5 and starts at $3000 per night. There are still openings.</p>
