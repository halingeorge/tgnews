      <h1>Why Is Pete Buttigieg's Campaign Dancing to a Panic! at the Disco Song?</h1>
      <h2>Mayor Pete Buttigieg has embraced the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF1xet-u_s">“High Hopes”</a> by musical group Panic! at the Disco for his campaign walk-on song, but his supporters are using it to fuel a dance to demonstrate their support for the South Bend Mayor.</h2>

      <p>The dance was popularized on social media after one volunteer stood in the back of a pickup in Nevada to teach supporters young and old the proper moves in October.</p>

      <p>A campaign volunteer also posted a video on Sunday of the entire team at a volunteer summit in New Hampshire doing the dance.</p>

      <p>Supporters were also filmed in Iowa doing the dance with giant blow-up posterboards of Buttigieg’s head in September.</p>

      <p>One volunteer posted a video of their team dancing to the song in November after “cleaning out” a bar of their supply of White Claw hard seltzer.</p>

      <p>Supporters are already posting individual versions of themselves doing the dance in campaign branded gear.</p>

      <p>It is unclear whether the dance is officially part of the campaign training process or something popularized by volunteers to the campaign.</p>
      <p>The Buttigieg campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
