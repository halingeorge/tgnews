      <p>One of the obvious perks of the holiday season is gift cards galore.</p>
      <p>Prepaid gift cards sold by credit card companies are a particularly great gift, because you can put the balance toward just about anything – including your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/paypal">PayPal</a> account.</p>
      <p>And adding a gift card balance to your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/paypal">PayPal</a> account might be a good idea if you often use <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/paypal">PayPal</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s also a great way to eliminate the possibility of forfeiting your funds before you’ve even had a chance to splurge – a lot of us are prone to losing physical copies of things.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to add a prepaid gift card from Visa, American Express, MasterCard, or Discover to your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/paypal">PayPal</a> account.</p>
      <h3>How to add a gift card to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/paypal">PayPal</a></h3>
      <p><b>1.</b> Go into your <a href="https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/money/">PayPal Wallet</a> on a desktop computer.</p>

      <p><b>4.</b> Enter the gift card information.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, you might run into an error trying to add a gift card to your PayPal account as a payment method because gift cards lack personal identifiers, unlike traditionally-issued credit cards.</p>
      <p>If you run into this kind of trouble, register your gift card – there should be instructions on the card that will direct you to a website for registration.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there are also ways to exchange <a href="https://www.paypal-cardcash.com/">non-credit card gift cards for money in your PayPal account</a>, but the cost of the transaction is significant – usually a minimum of 10% of the value of the gift card.</p>
