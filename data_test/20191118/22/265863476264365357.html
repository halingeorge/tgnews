      <h1>Scheana Shay Gushes Over Her New Boyfriend – Says She Thinks He’s ‘The One!’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:49:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Scheana Shay is apparently in a relationship with her personal trainer, Brock Davies and while their romance was made public only a few days ago, it turns out that he might just be the one for her! The Vanderpump Rules star herself said it during a new interview!</p>
      <p>So it seems like Scheana is head over heels with her current man and is not shying away from telling the whole world how she feels about him!</p>
      <p>Scheana made it clear that things are pretty serious between her and Brock and getting even more so as the time goes on.</p>
      <p>While at the first edition of BravoCon, she chatted with HollywoodLife, telling the site that ‘I know I have thought that before, but the difference is that I was just convincing myself. But there was a pit in my stomach. With Mike, with Rob, with Adam…always there was. Even if it was only one, there was always a solid red flag I ignored. The day of my wedding, I had that pit in my stomach, and thought it was just nerves.’</p>
      <p>However, she believes that ‘This is my body saying, ‘This is not right, do not do it.’ So this is the very first time I have been with someone where it feels right and I am not convincing myself of it.’</p>
      <p>The happy couple has been an item for just a few months and have been trying to keep the romance as private as they can.</p>
      <p>But Scheana still couldn’t help but gush over her man during the interview.</p>
      <p>Still, she dished that ‘We agreed mutually. It is still new and I’ve grown so much in the last two years. I have been single and, you know, whenever I start dating someone new and call him my boyfriend…that is it for me. Hopefully single Scheana never coms back. So I am taking it slower in the public, and in 6 months, if this is still going the way that it is, then you will probably see him more.’</p>
