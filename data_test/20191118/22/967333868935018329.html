      <p>According to the company's statement, the outlined transformation programme "is needed to ensure the business can thrive despite severe market headwinds which have led to a sharp decline in profitability. At the same time, <a href="https://www.tatasteeleurope.com/en/news/news/tata-steel-outlines-proposals-for-transformation-programme-to-build-a-stronger-and-more-sustainable-business-in-europe">it aims to secure</a> the foundation for investments required to accelerate innovation and the companyâ€™s journey towards carbon-neutral steelmaking".</p>
      <blockquote>The measures also include "<a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201607091042688866-sale-tata-steel-uk-brexit/">Increasing sales</a> of higher-value steels by improving product mix and customer focus" and the "reduction of procurement costs through smarter sourcing and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201604121037852823-uk-fund-tata-port-talbot-steelworks/">strengthening cooperation</a> with companies within the Tata Steel group".</blockquote>
      <p>According to the statement, the job cuts will affect about two-thirds of the company's staffers in Europe which "<a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201902011072024295-eu-steel-imports/">are expected</a> to be office-based roles".</p>
