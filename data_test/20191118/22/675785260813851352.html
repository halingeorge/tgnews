      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> is already making plans for the 2022 World Cup but admits he might not be in charge by then.</p>
      <p>Southgate says the past week has shown him how quickly “people can fall out of love with you” and insisted his long term future will depend on England being successful at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> manager Southgate made the frank admission on the back of his most testing week in charge after his handling of the row between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez has been widely questioned.</p>
      <p>But when Southgate goes to the Club World Cup next month in Qatar to watch <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , he will be determined to try and plan for the next World Cup.</p>
      <p>And he joked England are already trying to beat the Germans to the best hotel.</p>

      <p>Southgate, who is under contract until 2022, said: “Well, when you have a week like we’ve had, you sense that people can fall out of love with you and if there isn’t a warmth for you to continue, then that can start to affect the team.</p>
      <p>“So, I’m realistic about how quickly those tides can turn. It will depend very much on how we get on next summer.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve always planned short, mid and long term over the last eight years. I’m actually going to go to Qatar to watch some of Liverpool’s games, but also, it’s exactly the time the World Cup will be played there.</p>

      <p>“Climate will be ideal to get a feel of, and pinpoint a couple of camps that we would stay in there.</p>
      <p>"When I started and we looked at other federations, we were almost embarrassed to go and look at where we should be preparing for.</p>
      <p>“And Germany were always there and they’d already secured the best bloody hotel.</p>

      <p>"So, I think we’ve had to be a bit bolder and say, ‘No, look, it’s not a jinx to go and do it.’ We’ve got to have belief in what we’re doing and execute the right preparation to be</p>
      <p>“Without taking any focus off what we’re doing next summer, we’ve got to get the next bit right, otherwise we’ll be behind the curve. And I think the best organisations get that short, mid-and long-term planning right.”</p>
      <p>England will go to Euro 2020 among the top seeds after winning their Group and are now guaranteed three games at Wembley next summer but will be under greater pressure to win.</p>
      <p>Southgate said: “We should go in feeling confident about ourselves and, equally, we know there are areas of the game we’ve got to get better at.</p>
      <p>“But I think all the top teams will feel the same; they’ve all got clear strengths and they’ve all got things that you’d highlight that you could have to exploit.”</p>
