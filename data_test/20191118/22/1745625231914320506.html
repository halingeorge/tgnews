In the first shot, she is in front of him where she posed directly to the camera. In the second, the couple was snapped from a different angle. Kim looked over her shoulder at her partner while they both smiled at each other.</p>
      <p>In her caption, she mentioned that she was on her way to New York while her boyfriend was going to Atlanta. She expressed that she was missing him at the time of posting and hinted that she might have to move to Atlanta to be around him more often.</p>
