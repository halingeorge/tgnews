      <h1>Love on the Spectrum: The gorgeous show making The Bachelor look boring</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:11:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/stephen-a-russell/" target="_blank">Stephen A Russell</a></address>
      <p>Ruth and Thomas are like any engaged couple about to celebrate their fourth anniversary together.</p>
      <p>Clearly besotted, they comically niggle each other.</p>
      <p>The only difference from the majority of Australians is that they are both on the autism spectrum, and Ruth is also deaf.</p>
      <p>The pair, who don’t want their last names used for privacy reasons, are participants in <i>Love on the Spectrum, </i>the beautiful new ABC TV show from the makers of multi-award-winning hit <i><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/employable-me-australia/">Employable Me</a>.</i></p>
      <p>It follows seven singles hoping for happiness with help from specialist dating coach Jodi Rogers.</p>
      <p>It also showcases hard-won success stories like that of Ruth, 22, and Thomas, 25.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s really bizarre people think people with autism can’t love,” bus driver Thomas tells <i>The New Daily</i> over the phone from the Brisbane home he shares with Ruth.</p>
      <p>“Love doesn’t have to look like it does on <i>The Bachelor</i>. A date can be very silly, and a relationship can be done differently.”</p>
      <p>Ruth says they were keen to take part to show other young autistic adults that love is possible.</p>
      <p>“When I was growing up, couples were pairing off in school, and I wished that would happen to me,” she says.</p>
      <p>“I thought maybe there was something wrong with me, something unlovable.”</p>
      <p>Seeing people like her on a TV show like <i>Love on the Spectrum</i> would have made her school days happier, back when it was difficult enough making friends, says Ruth.</p>
      <p>She argues <i>The Bachelor</i> and <i>Love Island’s</i> narrow definition of who deserves love is problematic: “Neuro-typical and able-bodied ideals are often portrayed as perfection, and of course they’re not.”</p>

      <p>Thomas was also lonely at school.</p>
      <p>“I tried my absolute best, unsuccessfully, and was pretty desperate for a romantic relationship, just for that connection,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I tried so many times with so many poor girls, and in the end the persistence paid off.</p>
      <p>“I found a pretty all right one. She dumped me pretty quickly, but then I met Ruth soon afterwards, so that was fine,” Thomas says.</p>
      <p>The first episode of the four-part series, produced by Northern Pictures, introduces us to the empowered Chloe, who suspects women are a better fit for her than men, and Michael, who has never been on a date, but is cheered on by his tight-knit family.</p>
      <p>As his sister says, she’s not on the spectrum and struggles enough finding love.</p>
      <p>Director and producer Cian O’Clery wanted to show a broader range of experience on the show.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully it allows you to get to know different types of people and realise that it’s a really diverse spectrum, and not to make any assumptions,” he says.</p>

      <p>Part of the problem, O’Clery suggests, is that awareness around autism has only picked up recently, and has been even more sluggish for girls.</p>
      <p>“When you speak to families whose kids are in their twenties, when they were babies, there was very little understanding,” he says.</p>
      <p>“When we were making <i>Employable Me</i>, we started hearing about the lack of support in the world of dating and relationships.</p>
      <p>“It just felt quite strange, given there’s so much support in other areas.”</p>
      <p>What representation there is of autism on our screens is often quite limited, he says.</p>
      <p>“You have <i>The Good Doctor</i> and Sheldon from <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, and for a lot of people I’ve spoken to, it can actually be a bit of a hindrance to them that these are the characters society latched on to.”</p>
      <p><i>Love on the Spectrum</i> aims to broaden the picture.</p>
      <p>“Pretty much all, bar one, of the single people we follow in the series had never been on a date in their entire life, which is crazy,” O’Clery says.</p>
      <p>“It’s not fair. Getting to know these unique people really opens your eyes to the world of difference out there.”</p>

        <b><i>Love on the Spectrum</i> debuts at 8.30pm on Tuesday, November 19 on ABC TV and iView</b>
