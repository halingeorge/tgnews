      <h1>Five Definitive Conclusions As Ireland Fall Just Short Against Denmark</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:08:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:08</time> by <a rel="author">Oisin McQueirns</a></address>

        <b>Ireland fell just short of automatic Euro 2020 qualification as they drew 1-1 with Denmark at the Aviva Stadium meaning it will be the playoff route for the Boys in Green.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Boys in Green began the game well and in the first half and had the best chance to open the scoring as Conor Hourihane found his way through on goal but his tame effort was easily stopped.</p>
      <p>Alan Browne saw a volley fly just wide in the opening 45 also but in the second half it was much of the same with Denmark failing to create and Ireland having the better of proceedings.</p>
      <p>It was against the run of play though when the Danes found the crucial goal as Martin Braithwaite snuck in between Shane Duffy and Matt Doherty to open the scoring in the 70th minute.</p>
      <p>The Wolves defender redeemed himself with a brilliant back-post header with five minutes to go but it wasn’t enough as Ireland fell short in Dublin.</p>

        <b>1)  An Admirable Performance But A Disappointing Result In The End For Ireland</b>
      </p>
      <p>Throughout 70 minutes this was truthfully one of the best displays we’ve seen from an Ireland side this campaign and when the Danish goal came it stung just that little bit more as it was McCarthy’s men who had the upper hand.</p>
      <p>The Irish manager’s team selection was familiar, save for Alan Browne on the right and the tactic of shutting down Denmark and attempting to nick a goal was almost the perfect formula for what was almost a special night in Dublin.</p>
      <p>It’s very hard to criticise either McCarthy or the Irish players based on tonight’s performance but one could argue that it was disappointing results from other games in the group that truly cost us.</p>
      <p>David McGoldrick could have done with some help up top earlier and Ireland’s creativity is still an issue – just seven goals scored in eight group matches – but it was so close to being the home side’s night.</p>
      <p>The two playoff games await.</p>

        <b>2) If It Is To Be Glenn Whelan’s Last Big Game, It Was One To Remember</b>
      </p>
      <p>If this is to be, <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/glenn-whelan-last-big-night/">as Glenn Whelan mentioned during the week,</a> his last big game for Ireland, then it was a memorable display from the 35-year-old.</p>
      <p>Although he’s been Ireland’s best midfielder throughout this campaign many questioned how he would cope against a dynamic Danish midfield and in particular their talisman Christian Eriksen.</p>
      <p>Whelan was excellent with Eriksen having very little influence on a game in which Ireland largely dominated throughout.</p>
      <p>He has often been maligned by certain Irish fans down through the years but he was calm and composed when required as he kept the Irish midfield ticking away.</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping the Hearts midfielder as one (or two) big performances left in the locker.</p>

        <b>3) Once Again David McGoldrick Was Brilliant For The Boys In Green</b>
      </p>
      <p>What a centre-forward David McGoldrick is.</p>
      <p>The Sheffield United man undoubtedly required a little bit more support up top and maybe could’ve done with another striker from the start but once again his all round play was brilliant.</p>
      <p>His touch was excellent throughout and his hold-up play was fantastic as usual as he worked the Danish front two and brought plenty of his teammates into the game.</p>
      <p>McCarthy’s side missed McGoldrick no end in the last two games with his ability to oftentimes play as both the number nine and number ten for Ireland a priceless asset to this side.</p>
      <p>He didn’t find the scoresheet at the Aviva but the Sheffield United man is so much more than that, and will be a huge player if the Boys in Green are to make it through the playoffs.</p>

        <b>4) Here’s Hoping This Is Ireland’s Last Run In With The Danes For The Foreseeable Future</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s six games now against Denmark without a win for Ireland.</p>
      <p>Even when The Boys in Green play excellently against Age Hareide’s side they always seem to have Ireland’s number, with Martin Braithwaite’s goal against the run of play summing up our recent luck against them.</p>
      <p>In truth though one could point to Ireland’s lack of creativity and ponder how we arguably should have punished a Danish side who never really looked overly comfortable at a sold-out Aviva Stadium.</p>
      <p>This will likely be our last clash with them for a while and it’s safe to say every Ireland fan will be pleased to see the back of Christian Eriksen and co.</p>

        <b>5) To The Playoffs We Go</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s a disappointing result for Ireland, there’s little question of that especially given the manner of their strong performance but there is of course the safety net of the playoffs.</p>
      <p>The Boys in Green will now play two one legged playoff games in March<a href="https://twitter.com/McDonnellDan/status/1196547595092611073?s=20"> against a host of potential opponents,</a> Bosnia, Wales or Slovakia looking like the prize in the semi-final depending on tomorrow’s results.</p>
      <p>Overall it’s a disappointing end to the campaign but tonight’s display will largely be a positive for Ireland as they prepare for the playoffs in March, whomever they may face.</p>
