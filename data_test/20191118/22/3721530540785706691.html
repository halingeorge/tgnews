      <p>Just after<i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/40381"><i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a>’s first weekend, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rudeism">streamer Dylan “Rudeism” Beck</a> built himself a dang motion controlled lightsaber and Force glove. He’s been streaming his <i>Fallen Order</i> playthrough on Twitch, complete with a fully body camera to show off his bizarre control scheme.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/dy3ppr/i_built_a_custom_controller_for_jedi_fallen_order/">In a Reddit post</a>, Rudeism showed off his build. The lightsaber looks to be an Obi-Wan plastic lightsaber toy, which Rudeism has hollowed out and placed various thumbsticks and buttons in. The blade lights up when he activates his lightsaber in game, and it reacts to different movements he makes — such as striking or blocking.</p>
      <p>The Force glove is very simple looking, but a bit more complex. On the palm, there’s a joystick for Rudeism to control Cal in-game. The Force powers use an IMU (inertial measurement unit) to determine which Force power Rudeism wants to use based on his movements. In a clip he shared from his stream (shown above), he simply pushes his hand out, away from his body, to use Force push.</p>

      <p>Rudeism’s ridiculous control scheme is the stuff Star Wars fans dream of. I remember wanting to create a super-powered magnet glove to Force pull my own Obi-Wan lightsaber to me at age eight. Turns out, it’s a bit more complicated than that. But as Rudeism proves, it’s certainly not impossible.</p>
      <p>Rudeism is currently streaming his way through the entirety of <i>Fallen Order</i> — exclusively with his motion controllers — on the hardest difficulty. This also isn’t Rudeism’s first rodeo with bizarre controllers, as he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/2/20894871/untitled-goose-game-controller-rudeism-twitch-streamer">recently played <i>Untitled Goose Game </i>using his entire body</a>.</p>
