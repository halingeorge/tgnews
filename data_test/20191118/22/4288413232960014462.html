      <h1>This Guy Hacked Together a DIY Cable Release for His Point-and-Shoot</h1>

      <p>There are any number of ways to trigger a digital camera remotely: from IR remotes to smartphone apps. But if you’re a bit more old fashioned, then Instructables user Steloherd has hacked together something you might like even better.</p>
      <p>Not satisfied with the USB cable release available for his Ricoh GR II, and still one of the few folks holding out against our smartphone overlords (bravo), Steloherd <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Mechanical-Remote-Release-for-Ricoh-GR-II-Digital/">created</a> a DIY mechanical shutter release for his camera that attaches via the hot shoe.</p>

      <p>You can find full step-by-step instructions for recreating this contraption <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Mechanical-Remote-Release-for-Ricoh-GR-II-Digital/">over on Instructables</a>, but it would be fairly easy to “reverse engineer” the attachment, even if all you had were photos of the final product.</p>
      <p>All you need is a 1/4″-20 screw, an accessory ‘foot’ for your hot shoe, an aluminium arm, a steel spring plate, and any mechanical remote release. For tools, he used a hacksaw, file, drill &amp; bits, pliers, and sandpaper, as well as a male and female M3 thread cutter.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, there was some modification and metal work to be done here, so this isn’t a weekend project for the novice shooter. But if you’re up to it, you’ll end up with a mechanical cable release for your digital camera, even if it doesn’t have a threaded shutter button:</p>

      <p>If you want to try and replicate this project at home, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Mechanical-Remote-Release-for-Ricoh-GR-II-Digital/">head over to the Instructables page</a> where you’ll find detailed step-by-step instructions that will guide you through the whole process. And if you’re a bit daunted by the scope here, don’t worry; Steloherd was kind enough to offer a few easier “alternative” instructions and materials at the bottom of that page.</p>
