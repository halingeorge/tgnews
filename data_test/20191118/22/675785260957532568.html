      <h1>Man on 10-hour TUI flight 'given popcorn and crisps' for a gluten-free meal</h1>
      <h2>Celiac disease sufferer James Howe forked out the extra cash along with a further £1,000 for premium seats to make the 10-hour Cancun to Gatwick honeymoon flight special - but staff told him there was no gluten-free meal available after take-off</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:01:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Bethan Sexton, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A furious passenger has slammed TUI after claiming he was given popcorn and crisps instead of a gluten-free meal he was expecting on a 10-hour flight.</p>
      <p>James Howe, who suffers from coeliac disease, says he had to endure a 10-hour flight with nothing but the snacks for nourishment after cabin crew told him there was no three course, gluten-free meal available after the plane had taken off.</p>
      <p>He was outraged after forking out extra cash to upgrade his flight only to be left with a bitter taste in the mouth.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old says he ordered the meal three months before his return flight to Gatwick from his honeymoon in Cancun.</p>
      <p>But desperate cabin crew were left scrambling around for options and even checked the captain's meal to see if it could be safely served up to James, he says.</p>

      <p>James and his new wife Claire, from Watford, Herts, spent £5,500 on the break, paying £1,000 extra for premium seats to make their honeymoon extra special.</p>
      <p>After the flight on October 18, a furious James took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page to complain to Tui, who claim online their catering offers an "abundance of choice".</p>
      <p>He posted a photo of himself posing with the paltry snacks with the caption: "Thanks Tui, this was the gluten free meal option given in premium flight on our at home from Mexico.</p>

      <p>"Popcorn and crisps to get me through 10+ hours. Fabulous way to end our lovely honeymoon."</p>
      <p>He added: "People beware if you book a meal 'they are subject to availability and nothing is guaranteed.'</p>
      <p>"Well sorry I won't be booking another holiday with you and advising anyone to go anywhere near a Tui shop."</p>

      <p>James' condition means he suffers bloating, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal pain if gluten is consumed.</p>
      <p>Speaking today, he said: "I had pre-booked gluten free food as celiac when I booked my holiday in July.</p>
      <p>"My flight from Gatwick to cancun was fine my meal was ready and nice. My flight back however - nothing.</p>

      <p>"When food was coming round they had no indication of my needs. There were gluten meals on board, as other passengers had some. As we had already taken off, there was nothing the crew could do.</p>
      <p>"The crew at one point brought out all the captain's food to read the packaging, but none of this was suitable. They could see how hungry I was."</p>
      <p>His post sparked condemnation from fellow social media users.</p>

      <p>Kelly Wombwell added: "Awful James."</p>
      <p>And Emma Roberts said: "Disgusting, how can large companies like this provide such poor service?"</p>
      <p>Tui state on their website that "a standard meal is included" on long haul flights.</p>
      <p>They also boast of the variety available on boarding, saying: "On board, you can enjoy our offer of hot and cold drinks, (non-)alcoholic drinks, sandwiches, snacks...</p>

      <p>"You can choose what you want to eat or drink and there's an abundance of choice."</p>
      <p>Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition where the body mistakenly attacks substances found inside gluten, causing inflammation of the small intestine.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from TUI said: "We’re very sorry to hear of Mr Howe’s experience on his journey home from Cancun.</p>
      <p>"We have contacted the customer directly to apologise and offer a gesture of goodwill."</p>
