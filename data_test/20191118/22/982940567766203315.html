      <p>Three teenage girls have joined efforts to help victims of domestic violence in Albania, where <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-albania-tech-women/albanian-teens-develop-app-for-domestic-violence-victims-idUSKBN1WN1MT?fbclid=IwAR38I3xEsNsxwNXG75X17Lza-i22evKWDdYRSmVDTisVH8rIS1MZnoAXqGE">one in every two</a> women suffers from violence.</p>
      <p>Arla Hoxha, Dea Rrozhani, and Jonada Shukarasi — known as the “D3c0ders” — created the mobile application <a href="https://twitter.com/GjejZa">GjejZâ</a> (which means “find your voice” in Albanian). It connects survivors of domestic violence to important resources, including shelters, police and support groups.</p>
      <p>The app also offers information on gender-based violence, inspirational stories of women who have overcome a violence situation, and breathing and meditation exercises.</p>
