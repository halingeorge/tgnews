      <p>ROBERTO MANCINI’S RAMPANT Italy broke more records as they maintained their 100% points return in Euro 2020 qualifying with a 9-1 thrashing of Armenia in Palermo.</p>
      <p>The Azzurri had long since booked their place in next year’s finals and last week defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina for a 10th consecutive win for the first time in their history.</p>
      <p>There was no slowing Italy in their final Group J game, though, as they turned on the style to end the campaign with 10 victories from 10.</p>
      <p>An 11th straight win in all saw seven different Italy goalscorers in a match for the first time, as Ciro Immobile and Nicolo Zaniolo each netted twice.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo, debutant Riccardo Orsolini and Federico Chiesa all notched their first goals for their country, with Nicolo Barella, Alessio Romagnoli and Jorginho also on target in a stunning success.</p>
