      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:50:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> has opened up about her transition on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>
      <p>The US reality star told her campmates that she thought she would have transitioned by the time she was 40.</p>
      <p>But the 70-year-old has been living as her authentic self for just a few years, after beginning her transition in 2015.</p>
      <p>In her autobiography, The Secrets Of My Life, Caitlyn detailed how she used to steal moments to dress up as her true self while she was living as Bruce.</p>
      <p>For years, after winning gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, Bruce travelled the country giving what he referred to as "The Speech", an inspirational talk all about working hard to achieve your dreams and success.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn writes about how she - as Bruce - longed for the moments she could go back to her hotel room and dress in women's clothing.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn says everyone who looked at Bruce saw "the world's greatest athlete" and "an American hero" - but it wasn't like that for her.</p>
      <p>She said: "They don't know that when I look into the mirror I see something entirely different, a body that I fundamentally loathe: a beard that is always noticeable no matter how close the shave, a penis that is useless except for p*****g in the woods, a chest that should have breasts, a face with a jawline too sharp and a forehead too high.</p>
      <p>"They don't know that contrary to what they imagine, I have slept with roughly five women in my life, and I was married to three of them."</p>
      <p>While she was living as Bruce, Caitlyn used to make the most of being away from home by packing women's clothing and a wig - with a ready-prepared excuse for airport security just in case - and would dress up as Caitlyn.</p>

      <p>She'd then go down to the lobby of the hotel and walk around, hoping no one would speak to her.</p>
      <p>She'd also sometimes drive around in her car and park up in quiet areas of car parks and get out just to walk around outside for a moment.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn wrote: "They don't know that underneath the dark blue business suit I am wearing panties and a bra and pantyhose. They don't know that I am not Bruce Jenner but a woman I will come to call Caitlyn, who still has to be Bruce expect for stolen moments here and there, twenty minutes or an hour or maybe two where I can feel what it is like to be my authentic self.</p>
      <p>"Imagine denying your core and soul. Then add to it the almost impossible expectations that people have for you because you are the personification of the American male athlete. You can't imagine it."</p>

      <p>Caitlyn's gender issues go back way before then to her childhood, when she always knew there was something not right about the way she felt in her body.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn says that as a little boy, she would sneak into her mother's closet when she was out and try on her dresses and a tie a scarf around her head and walk down the street outside, hoping no one would notice her.</p>
      <p>After growing out of her mum's clothes, she later secretly wore clothes from her sister's wardrobe.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn says she got to a point where she didn't care about "The Speech", and only cared about the time out on the road when she could dress up.</p>

      <p>She said it was something her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, as well as her previous wives Chrystie and Linda, would never allow in the house.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn used to use clear plastic wrap in a "homegrown method of feminization" to cinch around her waist and heighten her hips and buttocks.</p>
      <p>She also used to use Krazy Glue to give herself a makeshift facelift.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn also talks in her book about how she'd dress up at home, and how daughters Kylie and Kendall once caught her in a dress after leaving the webcam recording on the computer in their bedroom.</p>
