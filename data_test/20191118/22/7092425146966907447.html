      <h1>The possible opponents Ireland could face in Euro 2020 play-offs</h1>

          <b>Ireland will have to take the long route through the play-offs if they want to qualify for Euro 2020 after being held to a draw by Denmark in their final Group D qualifier at the Aviva Stadium.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite a gutsy performance from the Boys in Green they came up just short as they failed to find a last-minute winner in <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/football/brave-ireland-head-euro-2020-play-offs-held-draw-denmark-aviva-343552"><b><i>tonight's 1-1 draw against a familiar opponent in the Danes.</i></b></a></p>
      <p>So it's to the play-offs Mick McCarthy's side now go in what will be Ireland's ninth play-off since the deciders were properly re-introduced to Uefa qualifying campaigns for Euro 96.</p>
      <p>Those looking for something positive this evening might be buoyed by the fact that Ireland has reached the last two European Championships through the playoff route, albeit not in this same format.</p>
      <p>Under the new play-off system, Ireland will play a one-off semi-final match away from home on March 26 and, should they win, will then take part in a one-off final on March 31 with a place at Euro 2020 up for grabs.</p>

      <p>The identity of who Ireland will face in the semi-final won't become clear until Tuesday following the meeting of Wales and Hungary in Group E.</p>
      <p>Now here's where things get a little complicated so bear with us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If Wales overcome Hungary and therefore secure automatic qualification, Ireland will take on Slovakia away from home in the playoff semi-finals.</li>
        <li>Should Wales draw with Hungry then Ireland will face Wales away - if Slovakia beat Azerbaijan.</li>
        <li>If Hungary manage to beat Wales, then Ireland will play Bosnia, Wales or Slovakia and a draw will take place to decide opponent. The draw will be held on Friday at 11am.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Should Ireland win their semi-final then the winners of the other Nations League B semi-final – between Bosnia and Herzegovina and either Northern Ireland(!!), Wales or Slovakia – will be our opponent in the final on March 31.</p>
