        <li>An investigation by the Intercept and the New York Times shows how Iran capitalized on US intelligence abandoning its Iraqi operatives in the wake of its 2011 troop withdrawal.</li>
        <li>Iraqis who had worked with the CIA told Iran about CIA safe houses, other Iraqis working for the Americans, and CIA training, according to the investigation.</li>
        <li>These leaks show how the same thing could happen in Syria as the US position there changes and its partner forces are forced into an agreement with the Syrian government, backed by Russia and Iran.</li>

      <p>A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/18/world/middleeast/iran-iraq-spy-cables.html">joint investigation</a> by the Intercept and the New York Times revealed on Monday how the US’s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 led to a massive intelligence failure that put sensitive US assets and information directly into the hands of Iranian power players – and gives a blueprint for how the very same thing could happen in Syria.</p>
      <p>The joint investigation by reporters James Risen and Murtaza Hussein of the Intercept and Tim Arango, Farnaz Fassihi, and Ronen Bergman for the New York Times analyzes information from about 700 pages of secret Iranain intelligence cables first obtained by the Intercept.</p>
      <p>Iran’s growing influence in neighboring Iraq is most visible in the allegiances of its prime minister, Adil Abdel Mahdi, and the frustrations of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rocket-attacks-on-baghdad-green-zone-100-yards-from-embassy-2019-10">protesters</a> flooding the streets of cities throughout Iraq and defacing photos of Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, burning Iranian flags, and even firebombing the Iranian consulate, the <a href="https://apnews.com/13c1f4d0ffdd4908ba340abf9631a3cb">Associated Press</a> reports.</p>
      <p>But that influence developed over years, and, as the cables show, came at the expense of vital American intelligence.</p>
      <p>When US forces pulled out of Iraq in 2011, covert operators left hurriedly, abandoning their sources and leaving them vulnerable to Iranian pressure. These sources, as the joint report points out, were left poor, terrified, and desperate. Iraqis who worked with US forces were in particular danger, hence the US State Department’s <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-visas-iraqis-employed-us-gov.html">Special Immigrant Visa</a> program which was created to help Iraqi and Afghan nationals who had worked for the US government to come to the US.</p>
      <p>At least some of the CIA’s Iraqi sources, whether fearing for their lives or in need of cash, flipped, telling Iranian intelligence everything they wanted to know: “the locations of CIA safe houses; the names of hotels where CIA operatives met with agents; details of his weapons and surveillance training; the names of other Iraqis working as spies for the Americans,” according to the report.</p>
      <p>The abrupt, chaotic pullout of US troops from northeast Syria last month opened the door for a number of dangerous scenarios for the US, including concerns that US intelligence developed and shared with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/veterans-of-isis-fight-lament-trumps-policy-in-syria-2019-10">Kurdish-led</a> forces who led the ground battle against <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/100-isis-prisoners-have-escaped-since-turkish-invasion-of-syria-2019-10">ISIS</a> in Syria, could be lost forever or fall into enemy hands.</p>
      <p>Eric L. Robinson, a former intelligence official with the National Counterterrorism Center who focused on counter-ISIS measures, <a href="https://twitter.com/UticaEric/status/1183715653578121216?s=20">tweeted</a> last month that the drawdown (at that point a pullout) was “a [counter-intelligence] nightmare, given years of SDF exposure to Allied [Special Operations Forces] and intelligence services. The SDF will be forced to give up [tactics, techniques, and procedures] names, locations, etc.,” he wrote. “What a coup for the Russian intelligence services – 5 years of history regarding the elite forces of NATO etc.”</p>
      <p>The Syrian regime, with which the SDF has made a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/russia-help-syria-kurd-join-government-1470734">still-murky</a> alliance in the face of Turkish aggression, counts as its closest allies Russia and Iran. Given the brutality of the Assad regime in Syria, and what we now know about Iran’s steady buildup in Iraq on the back of CIA intelligence, the very same thing could happen with US intelligence assets in Syria.</p>
      <p>As Robinson told <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/10/us-intelligence-disaster-looming-syria/600226/">The Atlantic’s Mike Giglio</a>, “Whether you’re talking about communications infrastructure or response times for medevac or response times for aviations support, that stuff is all interesting,” and warns that a final deal could include “not just speaking with Syrian intelligence officers but Russians and Iranians.”</p>
      <p>Brian Katz, a former CIA official, told The Atlantic, “understanding how the US military, Special Operations, and intelligence community operate is going to be very valuable for Russia and Iran – if not in Syria now, then wherever we’ll be competing and fighting in the coming years. They’ll have a playbook for how we operate.”</p>
      <p>But as the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-downplays-demonizes-protests-amid-internet-shutdown-2019-11">Iran</a> cables show, it already does have a playbook for how the US operates, at least from an intelligence perspective. As the US influence wanes in the region, that playbook may become more complete and be in even more malign hands.</p>
