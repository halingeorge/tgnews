      <h2>The celebs in Main Camp failed to bag any luxury items for Snake Rock during the gruelling Put Your Oar In It challenge</h2>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! Main Camp stars failed to grab any luxury items during a Bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway, Adele Roberts, Roman Kemp and Myles Stephenson all took part in the challenge but despite their hard teamwork they failed.</p>
      <p>Gathering by a dirty swamp to take part in a night time challenge, Roman read a laminate out to everyone which said: "In front of you are 10 luxury items, one for each of the celebrities in both camps.</p>
      <p>"Your job is to get each item from the wheel onto the basket however you can only use the oars. You will win each luxury item that reaches the basket."</p>
      <p>Kate gave a stunned response: "Oh no, what if we drop someone elses. Oh the pressure!"</p>

      <p>The celebrities lined up in a row with their oars balanced above the swamp and they had to pass each luxury item box down the row on the oars without dropping it in the swamp.</p>
      <p>They didn't do very well and the only luxury items they managed to successfully pass from wheel to basket were Adele and Kate's.</p>
      <p>It left nothing for Snake Rock.</p>

      <p>Fans of the show were left baffled as to why Rak Su's Myles Stephenson chose to take a disposable camera into the Jungle when the whole thing is being filmed.</p>
      <p>One said: "Why would you chose a disposable camera as your luxury item when THE WHOLE THING IS BEING FILMED FOR TV".</p>

      <p>Another penned: "A disposable camera? Yeah, like it's not on telly or anything like that! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>
      <p>A fourth wrote: "Miles wants to make memories on a disposable camera on a show that’s being recorded and televised for the world to see".</p>
      <p>While others were questioning why the stars were getting luxury items already just a day into the new series.</p>
