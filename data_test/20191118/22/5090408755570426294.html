      <h1>The top 20 Black Friday bestsellers among Business Insider readers last year, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:37:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:37</time> by <a rel="author">Remi Rosmarin, Connie Chen, Business Insider US</a></address>

        <li>Need some Black Friday shopping inspiration? You might want to start with a list of last year’s bestselling products.</li>
        <li>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2KnymuH">Instant Pots</a> to <a href="https://amzn.to/32QJVRJ">Echo Dots</a> to <a href="https://amzn.to/33NxM18">23andMe DNA test kits</a>, these were the 20 top sellers among Business Insider readers last year.</li>
        <li>Some of these items are currently on sale for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals">Black Friday 2019</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a> is the biggest shopping event of the year. It’s a good way to make a major dent in your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/insider-picks-gift-guides">holiday gift shopping</a> or perhaps even treat yourself to something you’ve been eyeing. With <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals">Black Friday 2019</a> quickly approaching, we it would be fun to take a look at what Business Insider readers were buying this time last year.</p>
      <p>Our readers’ purchases last year told us a few things – namely, that they’re using tech in all sorts of ways to streamline their lives. Unsurprisingly, smart home device purchases, particularly from the <a href="https://amzn.to/2pl78xB">Amazon Echo</a> family, were towards the top of the list.</p>
      <p>Based on the popularity of these items from last year’s Black Friday, you can make a pretty good guess that they’ll be discounted this year as well.</p>
      <p>While this data tells us a lot about the types of products and services you’re interested in, we still love it when you drop us a line at insiderpicks@businessinsider.com and tell us things you’d like to hear more about or are perhaps having trouble finding on your own.</p>

      <p>As an owner of a Fire TV Stick myself, I can attest to the convenience of the streaming media player. This device puts all your streaming services, like Netflix, Hulu, HBO NOW, and YouTube, in one place so you can easily navigate through them all. Outside of your home, you can pick up right where you left off by plugging the Fire TV Stick into any TV’s HDMI port and connecting to Wi-Fi.</p>
