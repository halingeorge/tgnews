      <p>The media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. MAC addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet and WiFi. This is used to track the device that is uploading or downloading over the internet. So for private or anonymous browsing not only IP addresses should be hidden but MAC addresses must be also hidden.</p>
      <p>In an Android device, you can change your <b>Media Access Control</b> access to make your Android activities private over the WiFi or other wireless networks. Just follow the below post to proceed.</p>
