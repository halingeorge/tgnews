      <p>Ukraine's former leader Petro Poroshenko has been designated a witness in a criminal investigation related to the nomination of judges, the state investigation bureau said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Poroshenko has been embroiled in a number of investigations since leaving office in May.</p>
      <p>But the latest investigation is the first abuse of power probe involving the former president, his office said.</p>
      <p>"His status is that of a witness," a spokeswoman for the bureau, which handles high-profile cases, told AFP.</p>
      <p>If Poroshenko's status changed to that of suspect, he could be prosecuted if parliament voted to lift his immunity as a lawmaker.</p>
      <p>If that happened, and he was convicted of abuse of power and calls to overthrow the government, he could face up to six years in prison.</p>
      <p>Poroshenko's office denounced the bureau's announcement as an attack sponsored by arch-enemy Moscow to "damage" his reputation.</p>
      <p>According to a statement released by the state investigation bureau earlier in the day, the 54-year-old former president is suspected of trying to "illegally influence" the makeup of the High Council of Justice earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The council is a state body which picks judges who are then appointed by the president.</p>
      <p>Ukraine's president between 2014 and 2019, Poroshenko was routed by Volodymyr Zelensky, a 41-year-old comedian with no previous political experience, in an election in April.</p>
      <p>He is now a lawmaker in a parliament dominated by Zelensky's ruling party.</p>
      <p>The head of the state investigation bureau, Roman Truba, has said that Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman, has been named as a witness in a dozen criminal investigations including a probe into alleged tax fraud.</p>
      <p>The probes were opened following allegations of a former senior official, Andriy Portnov, Poroshenko's foe who lived in Russia and Austria during his presidency.</p>
      <p>Portnov is a close friend of Andriy Bodgan, head of Zelensky's administration.</p>
