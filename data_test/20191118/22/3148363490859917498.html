      <p>The judge sentenced Jamil Bader, 60, of Teaneck, to 37 months in prison after Bader pleaded guilty in July to one count of fraud, NBC New York <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Newark-Store-Owner-Sentenced-for-Running-Food-Stamp-Fraud-Scheme-564958172.html">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Bader ran a small grocery store in Newark but placed the ownership of it in another name to avoid his involvement due to a similar fraud scheme where he was banned from accepting food stamps.</p>
      <p>Like many fraudsters who run these schemes out of convenience stores, Bader offered customers cash in exchange for food stamp benefits and pocketed some of the money for himself.</p>
      <p>Between September 2013 and September 2016, Bader’s scam made $754,424. The court ruled that he will now have to repay the money made through the scam to the federal government.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Bader attempted to flee the U.S. to avoid prosecution but was later arrested.</p>
      <p>Some store owners convicted of food stamp fraud have received much stiffer penalties for their crimes. One New Jersey man <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2019/06/19/new-jersey-man-faces-5-years-prison-3-million-food-stamp-fraud/">convicted</a> of food stamp fraud faced five years in prison for running a $3 million food stamp fraud operation in Connecticut.</p>
      <p>Others have received lesser penalties for the same crime. A Rochester, New York, man was <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2019/09/28/food-truck-owner-sentenced-82000-food-stamp-fraud-scheme/">sentenced</a> to eight months’ home detention, two years’ probation, and had to pay back the $82,000 he stole from the government.</p>
