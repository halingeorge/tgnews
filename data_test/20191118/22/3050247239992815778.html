      <h1>Crypto Markets Continue to Drop, Bitcoin Briefly Slips Below $8,200</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:20:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>After another <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-in-golden-pocket-as-trader-warns-of-7-400-breakdown">sell-off</a> earlier today, crypto markets have continued to fall, with Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) briefly dropping below the $8,200 threshold.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, 19 out of the top 20 coins by market cap are seeing significant losses. Texos (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/tezos-xtz">XTZ</a>), the 17th altcoin by market cap, is resisting the bearish movement, still trading up around 1% over the past 24 hours at press time, according to <a href="https://coin360.com/table">Coin360</a>.</p>

      <p>After Bitcoin <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-in-golden-pocket-as-trader-warns-of-7-400-breakdown">failed</a> to reclaim $8,500 earlier today, its price has only continued to fall, dropping to as low as $8,104 per coin earlier on the day. At press time, Bitcoin has attempted a modest recovery and is trading at $8,215, down 4% over the past 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>New downturn to open up the potential for Bitcoin to return to $7,400</h3>
      <p>While Bitcoin is seeing a significant drop over the past seven days, down more than 5%, the major cryptocurrency is almost flat over the past 30 days at press time.</p>
      <p>The fresh decline in the market is considered by some analysts to expose Bitcoin to a potential return to $7,400, as Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-in-golden-pocket-as-trader-warns-of-7-400-breakdown">reported</a> today.</p>
      <p>In contrast, other analysts <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-key-pattern-is-suggesting-68-chance-of-bullish-reversal">suggested</a> that Bitcoin’s recent trading into a falling wedge is typically a bullish pattern that has a success rate of breaking to the upside in around 68% of cases.</p>
      <p>Last week, the CEO and co-founder of Distributed Lab <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/expert-bitcoin-may-crash-to-zero-because-of-institutional-adoption">claimed</a> that Bitcoin price could “crash to zero” in the event of mass adoption by institutions.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is trading down 3.5% at $178. The top altcoin is seeing a similar percentage loss over the past seven days at press time.</p>

      <p>Total market capitalization amounts to $225 billion as of press time, as recorded by <a href="https://coin360.com/table">Coin360</a>.</p>
      <p>While industry experts are arguing about the near future of Bitcoin’s price, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-lee-like-faang-stocks-btc-will-hit-25k-due-to-network-value">reaffirmed</a> his $25,000 prediction by 2022, claiming that such growth is “quite easy to achieve.”</p>
