      <h1>Playoff Permutations After Ireland Fail To Qualify Automatically For Euro 2020</h1>

        <b>The Republic of Ireland will need a playoff to reach Euro 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After recording a 1-1 draw in the Aviva Stadium against Denmark on Monday night, Ireland have failed to qualify directly for the tournament next summer – which will see Dublin host four games.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s side finished third in Group D, behind top seeds Switzerland and Denmark, and will now need to navigate a tricky Nations League playoff in March.</p>

      <p>The playoffs begin on March 26th and end on March 31. There will be a one-legged semi-final and final and Ireland will be coming through Path B. Ireland will face Nations League teams from League B who have also failed to qualify automatically. As of Monday night, Ireland’s potential semi-final opponents are <b>Wales</b>, <b>Slovakia</b> and <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Northern Ireland</b> are also assured of a playoff place in Path B. However, as they and the Republic are the lowest-ranked sides in the draw, they cannot face Mick McCarthy’s team in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Wales play Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday night. If they win, Ryan Giggs’ side will qualify automatically for Euro 2020. If Hungary win, they will qualify directly for the tournament. If it ends in a draw, and Slovakia beat Azerbaijan, then Slovakia will take the automatic spot.</p>

      <p>So, at the moment, it is working out as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If Wales win on Tuesday night, Ireland will play away to Slovakia in the Nations League Path B semi-final.</li>
        <li>If Hungary beat Wales, Ireland will play Wales, Bosnia or Slovakia.</li>
        <li>If Slovakia qualify automatically, Ireland will play away to Wales in the semi-final.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No matter what happens on Tuesday night though, Ireland will be away in the semi-final due to their Nations League ranking being lower than their potential opponents.</p>
      <p>The home team for the final will be decided by a draw and the draw for the playoffs will be made on Friday. The picture will become a lot clearer on Tuesday night.</p>
