      <h1>Google Play Store’s app recommendation system is powered by DeepMind</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:20:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>DeepMind is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/03/18/deepmind-agi-control/">widely regarded</a> as the premier machine learning and artificial intelligence research lab. Under Alphabet, it’s collaborated with various teams at Google over the years. The latest sees DeepMind technology being <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Advanced-machine-learning-helps-Play-Store-users-discover-personalised-apps">leveraged</a> for Play Store app recommendations.</p>
      <p>Discovery is a central part of any app store, and Google’s approach features both <a href="https://9to5google.com/2017/06/13/google-play-store-editors-choice-android-excellence/">editorial</a> and algorithmic curation. According to DeepMind, the Play Store “supports one of the largest recommendation systems in the world” with billions of users every month.</p>
      <p>Google takes into consideration “past user preferences” — downloads and installs — to “deliver a richer, personalised experience.” DeepMind collaborated with the Play team to “develop and improve systems that determine the relevance of an app with respect to the user.”</p>
      <blockquote>This, however, requires nuance – both for understanding what an app does, and its relevance to a particular user. For example, to an avid sci-fi gamer, similar game recommendations may be of interest, but if a user installs a travel app, recommending a translation app may be more relevant than five more travel apps.</blockquote>
      <p>At a high-level, there are three main models to the recommendation system: a candidate generator, a reranker, and a model to optimize for multiple objectives. A <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Advanced-machine-learning-helps-Play-Store-users-discover-personalised-apps">blog post</a> today goes in-depth on each part.</p>
      <blockquote>The candidate generator is a deep retrieval model that can analyse more than a million apps and retrieve the most suitable ones. For each app, a reranker, i.e. a user preference model, predicts the user’s preferences along multiple dimensions. Next these predictions are the input to a multi-objective optimisation model whose solution gives the most suitable candidates to the user.</blockquote>
      <p>The DeepMind for Google team also shed some light into the collaboration process, noting daily communication:</p>
      <blockquote>Because the Play Store and DeepMind teams worked so closely together and communicated on a daily basis, we were able to take product requirements and constraints into consideration throughout the algorithm design, implementation, and final testing phases, resulting in a more successful product.</blockquote>
