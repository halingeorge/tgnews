      <p>Britain’s Prince Andrew became the laughingstock of the tabloid world over the weekend, when he sat down for a very awkward interview about his past friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The interview was largely panned since the Duke of York didn’t show much regret for continuing the relationship once the sexual abuse accusations against Epstein first started coming out in the late aughts.</p>
      <p>And he made up several elaborate excuses to discredit the allegations made by one of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre Roberts, who alleges that she was forced to have sex with the prince as a teen.</p>
      <p>Here’s how 15 tabloids covered the story.</p>
