      <h1>Ireland player ratings as Mick McCarthy's men left heartbroken in draw with Denmark</h1>
      <h2>Ireland gave it their all in the dying minutes to find a winner after the Danes went ahead with fifteen minutes to go</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T22:40:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 22:40</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Here's how Ireland players rated as Mick McCarthy's men came agonisingly close to automatic qualification for Euro 2020 against Denmark tonight:</p>
      <p>Darren Randolph 6 - Little enough to contend until the goal and had Duffy to thank for blocking Eriksen’s early shot.<br/><br/>Matt Doherty 7 - Kept a lid on raiding Danes and was an attacking threat before his equalising goal<br/><br/>Shane Duffy 7 - Stand-in skipper made a vital block to thwart Eriksen and put his head and body on the line.<br/><br/>John Egan 5 - In the wars early doors and while he soldiered on, a calf injury forced him off <br/><br/>Enda Stevens 7 - Showed great feet to get out of some tricky situations and assisted Doherty goal.<br/><br/>Jeff Hendrick 6 - Worked hard to close down rivals but distribution could have been better</p>

      <p>Glenn Whelan 7 - Enforcer set an early tone getting in Danish faces and clever use of the ball. Booked.<br/><br/>Conor Hourihane 6 - Put himself about and had a great chance to open the scoring in the first-half.<br/><br/>Alan Browne  7 - Justified his selection with a busy display and was close to scoring in first-half<br/><br/>David McGoldrick 8 - Popped up everywhere, linking the play and firing off shots in a clever MOTM display<br/><br/>James McClean 6 - Worked tirelessly for the cause throughout but his crosses were disappointing. Booked<br/><br/><b>IRELAND SUBS:</b><br/>Ciaran Clark for Egan (half-time) 6 -<br/>Callum Robinson for Hourihane (68 mins) 5 -<br/>Sean Maguire for Whelan (82 mins) - 7<br/><br/><b>DENMARK:</b> Schmeichel; Dalsgaard, Jorgensen, Kjaer, Stryger Larsen; Braithwaite, Schone (Christensen 84), Delaney (Hojbjerg 13) ; Eriksen; Poulsen, Cornelius (Dolberg 33).<br/><br/><b>Referee:</b>  F Brych</p>
