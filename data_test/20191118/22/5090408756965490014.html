        <li>Tribeca’s 10007 is the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-04/nyc-s-trendy-neighborhood-leaps-into-top-five-richest-zip-codes">richest ZIP code in New York City,</a> where residents have an average income of $879,000, according to Bloomberg.</li>
        <li>It’s also the most expensive ZIP code in the city, with <a href="https://www.propertyshark.com/Real-Estate-Reports/most-expensive-zip-codes-in-the-us">a median sale price of $3.9 million</a>, according to a recent PropertyShark report.</li>
        <li>I spent an afternoon in the trendy Manhattan neighborhood earlier this year, and it was a clear example of how the look of wealth is changing.</li>
        <li>Tribeca draws a stark contrast to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-row-nyc-map-apartments-real-estate-photos-2019-4">Billionaires’ Row</a>, where hedge-fund and tech billionaires buy penthouses – many of which are secondary residences – at the top of sleek 1,000-foot-tall towers in <a href="https://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods/manhattan/midtown">midtown Manhattan, an area bustling with tourism and retail.</a></li>
        <li>The city’s richest ZIP code, on the other hand, is a vibrant, trendy, and walkable neighborhood full of young people and families.</li>

      <p>Tribeca, a trendy neighborhood in downtown Manhattan, is home to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-04/nyc-s-trendy-neighborhood-leaps-into-top-five-richest-zip-codes">New York City’s richest ZIP code</a>, where the average income of residents is $879,000, Bloomberg reported.</p>
      <p>It’s the fifth-richest ZIP code in the US, according to Bloomberg’s ranking.</p>
      <p>Tribeca is <a href="https://streeteasy.com/neighborhoods/tribeca/#map-location">“the epitome of downtown cool,”</a> according to StreetEasy. The neighborhood, which borders the Hudson River to the west and the Financial District to the south, is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paparazzi-proof-building-in-tribeca-for-celebrities-2017-1">a celebrity hotspot that has been home to stars including Taylor Swift</a>, Jennifer Lawrence, and Steven Spielberg.</p>
      <p>And real estate in Tribeca is notoriously pricey. PropertyShark ranked it the most expensive neighborhood in New York City, with a <a href="https://www.propertyshark.com/Real-Estate-Reports/most-expensive-zip-codes-in-the-us">median sale price of $3.9 million</a>. The <a href="https://streeteasy.com/neighborhoods/tribeca/">median rent is $6,195</a>, according to StreetEasy.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, I spent an afternoon walking through the downtown Manhattan neighborhood. Here’s what New York City’s richest and most expensive ZIP code looks like.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Tribeca, a trendy neighborhood in downtown Manhattan, is New York City’s richest ZIP code.</h3>

      <h3>On a late-spring afternoon earlier this year, I decided to take a walking tour of Tribeca to get a feel for the neighborhood.</h3>

      <p>I walked up from my office in the Financial District, the neighborhood directly south of Tribeca. Even though it’s not far from where I work, I had never spent much time in the neighborhood.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Tribeca, which used to be home to warehouses, is known for its industrial architecture.</h3>

      <p>But in recent years, <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/maps/tribeca-new-buildings-apartments-for-sale">sleek luxury condominium towers have been rising</a> across the neighborhood.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The tallest building in the neighborhood is 56 Leonard, a 60-story tower built in 2015.</h3>

      <p>The cheapest available units in the building are a two-bedroom condo for $4.85 million and a one-bedroom rental for $8,850 per month, according to StreetEasy.</p>

      <h3>Tribeca is home to a Whole Foods Market that spans an entire city block.</h3>

      <p>I also passed chains like Starbucks and the luxury fitness center Equinox, which has locations across New York City.</p>

      <h3>I saw many young families and parents pushing strollers in the neighborhood.</h3>

      <h3>I was surprised by the amount of green space I found in Tribeca.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://bpcparks.org/whats-here/parks/teardrop-park/">Teardrop Park</a>, a 2-acre green space tucked away between Warren Street and Murray Street where a children’s birthday party seemed to be taking place.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>And just a few minutes’ walk away is Hudson River Park, which offers panoramic views of the Hudson River and the New Jersey skyline.</h3>

      <h3>Tribeca is one of New York City’s oldest neighborhoods, and much of its pre-Civil War architecture is intact.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>“[Tribeca] boasts one of the world’s largest collections of Neo-Grec designs and wrought-iron facades, in loft-style low-rises that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heathersenison/2018/09/13/tribeca-architecture-a-blend-of-new-york-citys-history-and-avant-garde/#466d489e69ef">real estate investors from around the globe covet</a>,” Heather Senison wrote for Forbes in 2018.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The neighborhood is known for its celebrity residents, several of whom have been known to cluster in one luxury condominium building: 443 Greenwich.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paparazzi-proof-building-in-tribeca-for-celebrities-2017-1">The luxury building has been called “paparazzi-proof”</a> because of features such as its lower-level parking and interior courtyard garden.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Lawrence <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2016/5/25/11767648/jennifer-lawrence-tribeca-apartment-nyc">looked into buying</a> a condo there, according to Curbed New York, and Mike Myers bought a $14.65 million loft in the building in 2017, only to put it on the market a week later and eventually <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/1/11/14241934/mike-myers-list-tribeca-apartment-sold">resell it at a loss for $14 million.</a></p>
      <p>A penthouse in the building was <a href="https://streeteasy.com/sale/1405624">on the market for $57 million</a> earlier this year. As of September 16, it was no longer available.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The neighborhood is full of leafy cobblestone streets that are surprisingly quiet.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/06/06/5d0015e56fc920387127e08d.png"/>

          <cite>Katie Warren/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I can certainly understand why those areas would be attractive to celebrity buyers.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>I started to head back toward the Financial District and passed a doggy daycare called PupCulture that had a sign out front advertising CBD products for dogs.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/06/06/5d0016806fc920420d6715c2.png"/>

          <cite>Katie Warren/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The sign read: “We now carry CBD oils, capsules, and edibles … for the puppies!”</p>
      <p>Given the skyrocketing popularity of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cbd-effects-physical-mental-benefits-limits-2019-5">CBD products</a>, I shouldn’t have been too surprised.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>As I strolled through the neighborhood, I noticed that Tribeca is home to virtually all of the trendiest chains in the city, from restaurants to fitness centers.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/06/06/5d00196c6fc9202e9411845a.png"/>

      <p>Sweetgreen and Dig Inn, two of the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/style/healthy-bowls-salad-waste.html">popular fast-casual healthy-ish dining options</a> in the city, can both be found in Tribeca.</p>
      <p>And when it comes to fitness, in addition to the usual suspect, Equinox – which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/equinox-membership-prices-reviews-nyc-guide-2019-5">can be found all over</a> the city – Tribeca is home to <a href="https://www.flywheelsports.com/">Flywheel Sports</a>, SoulCycle, Crunch Fitness, Barry’s Bootcamp, Planet Fitness, Pure Barre, SLT Tribeca, a CrossFit gym, and other fitness centers.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Tribeca is also home to upscale eateries.</h3>
      <figure>

          <cite>Katie Warren/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Among those eateries is Cut by Wolfgang Puck, “where <a href="https://wolfgangpuck.com/dining/cut-new-york/">New Yorkers broker deals over power meals</a>,” according to its website, as well as Wolfgang’s Steakhouse.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The temperatures were in the low 80s during my tour of the neighborhood.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/06/06/5d001ca96fc9202ec854cc7b.png"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Many people were taking advantage of the weather by eating and drinking outside.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>I noticed people wearing a lot of stylish athleisure jumpsuits, summer dresses, and sneakers.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/06/06/5d001d1a6fc9203eb92ac997.png"/>

          <cite>Katie Warren/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I was also surprised by how many big dogs I saw in the neighborhood, given that New York City is home to some notoriously cramped apartments.</p>
      <p>But considering the average income in the neighborhood is $879,000, I can also see how residents might have more disposable income to pay a place like PupCulture to walk their large dogs – and feed them CBD edibles.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>As I wrapped up my tour of Tribeca, it struck me that the neighborhood draws a stark contrast to Billionaires’ Row, the stretch of luxury skyscrapers along Central Park in midtown Manhattan.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/06/06/5d001de06fc9203af9601792.png"/>

      <p>And while midtown Manhattan is a bustling business, tourism, and retail district, Tribeca is more walkable, <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1_Natl-Assoc-of-Realtors-2015-Community-Preference-Survey.pdf">a key factor when millennials are deciding where to live</a>, with cobblestone streets and a vibrant restaurant and bar scene.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/exercise-worthy-investment-boosts-happiness-jean-chatzky-2019-4">Millennials have also been called the “wellness generation,”</a> and they are willing to shell out serious money on gym memberships, which helps explain the plethora of fitness centers in Tribeca.</p>
      <p>To me, while Billionaires’ Row strikes me as more “old money,” Tribeca, with its SoulCycles and Sweetgreens, exemplifies the changing look of wealth in the city.</p>
