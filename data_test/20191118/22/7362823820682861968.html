      <h1>Rep. Dina Titus slams Trump at Nevada conference: 'I'd like to impeach the bastard right now'</h1>

      <p>A House Democratic lawmaker slammed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> during a forum in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/nevada">Las Vegas</a> this weekend that featured appearances by several top <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 contenders</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/nevada">Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev.</a>, was speaking at the "First in the West" event at the Bellagio hotel Sunday night when she offered harsh words for the president in front of a raucous crowd.</p>
      <p>"The heart and soul of our nation is on the ballot," she said. "This is the most important election of your lifetime."</p>
      <p>Titus, 69, claimed Nevada's standing as the first western state to hold a Democratic caucus this year is "the first step to getting this con artist out of the White House."</p>
      <p>"Frankly, I think the House [of Representatives] is going to do it and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">I'd like to impeach</a> the bastard right now," she added, referencing the ongoing impeachment inquiry against Trump.</p>

      <p>The fiery remarks drew chants of "Dina! Dina!" and loud applause from the crowd.</p>
      <p>Turning to the Democrats hoping to challenge Trump, Titus claimed each candidate is "head and shoulders above anything he's got to offer."</p>
      <p>The president, she said, has "a rabid fan base that will turn out no matter what he does."</p>
      <p>"He will lie and cheat and steal and even bribe a foreign government to win this election, so we've got to be ready for it," Titus added.</p>
      <p>Titus also spoke about recent Democrat election victories, singling out a newly-elected Virginia lawmaker who lost her previous job after she was photographed making an obscene gesture toward Trump's motorcade.</p>
      <p>"We took the Kentucky governorship and the Louisiana governorship," she said, "but my favorite one was the lady who flipped off the president and then got elected."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-cyclist-who-flipped-off-trumps-motorcade-appears-to-have-won-race-for-local-office">Juli Briskman, 51, ran against Republican incumbent Suzanne Volpe</a> for a spot on the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors in Northern Virginia.</p>
      <p>Briskman launched her campaign after she was fired from a government contracting firm for violating the “code-of-conduct policy." She'd revealed to her bosses at Virginia-based Akima LLC that she was the woman flipping off the motorcade in a viral photo.</p>
      <p>Titus said Briskman's victory was also fitting because Loudoun County, outside Washington D.C., is also home to one of Trump's golf courses.</p>
      <p>"Is that not poetic justice?" she asked. "It just doesn't get any better than that."</p>
