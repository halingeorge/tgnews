      <h1>Time to Buy Value Stocks?</h1>
      <h2>Financial media may be hammering the table on value, but small-cap growth stocks get my vote</h2>

      <p>What an interesting fourth quarter it’s been so far! While the stock market has hit new record high after record high, the leadership <i>behind</i> the rally is different. What do I mean by that? This time it’s not growth stocks, but value stocks leading the charge.</p>

      <p>This isn’t because value stocks are the better investments. Rather, it’s because of another mean reversion rally/short covering, or “crap” rally, as I like to call them. This is when investors buy weak stocks with little upside that might pop briefly, rather than stocks with strong momentum and plenty of future upside.</p>
      <p>As you may recall, I talked about this in September. Bespoke found that the worst-performing 50 stocks from the market’s last all-time high became the best-performing stocks.</p>
      <p>We saw similar market action in October and November, with value stocks outperforming growth. As you can see in the chart below, from October 1 to November 8, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (the blue line) is up almost 7%, while the iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (the orange line) is up just 4%.</p>

      <p>Now, before you run out and fill your portfolio with value stocks, I’ll ask you to pump the brakes just a little bit. Yes, I know the financial media is hammering the table on value right now. <i>CNBC</i> is a great example of this. On Nov. 8, it released an article about <b>JPMorgan Chase’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/jpm-stock-quote/"><b><u>JPM</u></b></a>) top quantitative analyst saying that the rotation into value stocks “is a once in a decade trade.” But the truth is this is just another mean reversion rally.</p>
      <p>Let’s take financials as an example. While the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/xlf-stock-quote/"><b><u>XLF</u></b></a>) climbed almost 9% during that same time period, this was nothing more than a mechanical bounce. You see, the banks’ forecasted earnings weren’t very good, but they’ll do better on a steeper yield curve.</p>
      <h3>Invest in Fundamentally Superior Small-Cap Stocks</h3>
      <p>All that said, a mean reversion rally isn’t necessarily a bad thing because it means that money isn’t leaving the market, it’s just sloshing from one side to the other. If anything, it’s helping build a foundation under the market to launch. And boy do I expect this market to launch.</p>
      <p>
        <u>In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the S&amp;P 500 rally another 20% in 2020!</u>
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime, whenever we’re experiencing a mean reversion rally, that’s the time to invest in the high-quality stocks. But if you’re not sure which stocks are truly the best, <a href="https://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT413421&amp;eid=MKT415017&amp;encryptedSnaid=&amp;snaid=&amp;step=start"><b>I can help you with that</b></a>. The financial media loves to throw out a lot of ideas and trends — they sure had no problem hyping up IPOs like <b>Uber </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/uber-stock-quote/"><b><u>UBER</u></b></a>) and WeWork, which ended up being complete disasters — and you can end up losing a lot of money that way.</p>
      <p>I’m so confident in the potential strength in small caps, I released <a href="https://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT413421&amp;eid=MKT415017&amp;encryptedSnaid=&amp;snaid=&amp;step=start"><b>six brand-new recommendations</b></a> in my <a href="https://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT413421&amp;eid=MKT415017&amp;encryptedSnaid=&amp;snaid=&amp;step=start"><b><i>Breakthrough Stocks</i></b></a> service on Nov. 8. I expect these stocks to rally nicely in the coming weeks as Wall Street returns its focus on <a href="https://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT413421&amp;eid=MKT415017&amp;encryptedSnaid=&amp;snaid=&amp;step=start"><b>companies with strong fundamentals, earnings and sales growth</b></a> with positive future guidance. For November, I really like small-cap growth stocks. We often get a liquidity injection, which causes small-cap stocks to “melt up.” They also have the early “January effect” working in their favor. This is when year-end pension funding and annual gift giving zero in on fundamentally superior small-cap stocks.</p>
      <p>There is a catch, though: <a href="https://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT413421&amp;eid=MKT415017&amp;encryptedSnaid=&amp;snaid=&amp;step=start"><b>The best time to buy</b></a> is the week before Thanksgiving, and that week is fast approaching.</p>
      <p>So, the best window to buy is closing soon!</p>
      <p>You’re going to want to get into position now so you don’t miss out on the next leg higher. To get started, <a href="https://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT413421&amp;eid=MKT415017&amp;encryptedSnaid=&amp;snaid=&amp;step=start"><b>you can get the six names here</b></a>.</p>
