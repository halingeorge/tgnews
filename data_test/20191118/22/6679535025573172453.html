      <p>A couple urged the district administration to take necessary steps to reunite their four-month-old newborn with them who they alleged was taken away by the girl’s parents.</p>
      <p>They submitted a petition at the district collectorate on Monday.</p>
      <p>The couple Raja and R. Meena, residents of Nainampatti village, got married against the wishes of their parents in 2017. The couple worked at a garments firm in Tiruppur and Meena recently delivered a boy in Tiruppur.</p>
      <p>Raja said that post-delivery, Meena became unwell and she was taken for treatment at the Tiruppur Government Hospital.</p>
      <h3>Better treatment</h3>
      <p>“For better treatment, she was later referred to the Coimbatore government hospital and I informed her parents regarding Meena’s condition.</p>
      <p>They decided to take Meena and newborn to Salem for better treatment at a private hospital here.”</p>
      <p>Meena said, “I recovered in a few days.</p>
      <p>However, my family lied to me that my son and husband died and they convinced to marry another person.</p>
      <p>I was taken back to village and I was locked up in my house.</p>
      <p>Later, I managed to escape from the place and returned to my husband in Tiruppur.</p>
      <h3>Child adoption</h3>
      <p>When enquired, my parents told that they gave our child in adoption to a family in Chennai.</p>
      <p>We have complained with police and Collector.”</p>
