      <p>Celts are going for a tenth straight domestic triumph — while the Ibrox men are desperately trying to end an eight-year trophy drought.</p>
      <p>The stakes couldn’t be higher, but Miller, who starred for both Old Firm clubs, reckons both teams are mentally strong enough to bounce back if the result goes against them.</p>
      <p>Miller, still banging the goals in for Partick Thistle at 39, said: “The final could go either way, but regardless of the outcome for Rangers it won’t detract from where they are.</p>
      <p>“Rangers are in a good place, as are Celtic with Neil Lennon doing a fantastic job. The Cup Final is a massive game for both sides, with Celtic trying to continue their dominance.</p>

      <p>“But Steven Gerrard and Rangers will be desperate to end Celtic’s run and also get their first silverware in eight years. There’s a lot on the line for both teams and someone will lose, but it shouldn’t detract from how good both teams have been this season.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see the outcome of the final having a bearing on the league title.</p>
      <p>“Once it’s gone then you need to refocus, and there’s even Europa League games after it, so it’s a big week and it will immediately shift to the next match.</p>
      <p>“I know from being involved in that environment if you lose then you want to bounce back straight away.</p>
      <p>“Whatever manager loses will be asking for that — and what better way than on a European night."</p>

      <p>This is the first Old Firm meeting at Hampden since April 2018, when the Hoops crushed their bitter rivals 4-0 in the Scottish Cup semi-final.</p>
      <p>It was the game which sparked the infamous dressing room rammy, which prematurely brought an end to Miller’s third stint at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>But the former Scotland star feels the current Gers side are unrecognisable to the shambles they were 18 months ago. Miller added: “I’m not surprised at the progress Rangers have made, because<br/>Gerrard is a winner, and you see the level of staff he’s brought in.</p>
      <p>“Any good manager’s team will be a reflection of them, and that’s translating into their performances. Right from the first league game, there seems to be a real willingness to find a way to win.</p>
      <p>“Gerrard was a winner as a player, and his team are showing that mentality too.</p>
      <p>“Rangers have improved massively. You maybe saw some signs of that in his first season in charge, but the real improvement has come in this campaign.</p>
      <p>“You only need to look at the first league game, when they were away to Kilmarnock, and Killie equalised with about 15 minutes to go.</p>
      <p>“It looked for all the world as though it was going to be another poor start to the season for Rangers.</p>
      <p>“But they somehow found a way to win, and that’s what successful teams do.</p>
      <p>“They didn’t play particularly well that day, and Killie were excellent in the second half and worthy of a draw.</p>
      <p>“But title-winning teams dig deep in these situations and get the job done.</p>
      <p>“Previously, that wasn’t the case, and I’m not just speaking about last season, but the years before also. Rangers weren’t consistently getting results until now.</p>
      <p>"I’m getting a really different vibe from the whole team just now. They seem to have the bit between their teeth domestically, and they are also having a brilliant run in the Europa League against good teams.</p>
      <p>“They have looked the best team in their group, and they can take the title race right down to the wire this time.”</p>
      <p>Part of Gers’ resurgence this term has been down to the form of lethal hitman Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p>The Colombian has already banged in 22 goals already, and has improved beyond all recognition since he shared a dressing room at Ibrox with Miller two years ago.</p>
      <p>Miller said: “Morelos was very raw when he first arrived, and everyone could see that along with the qualities he had.</p>
      <p>“The one thing that’s never been in question is his level of goals, and that’s improving with each year.</p>
      <p>“When you look at the standard of player arriving at Ibrox in the last 18 months then it helps because you will always get opportunities.</p>
      <p>“Morelos has improved all-round, and his game seems to be a bit cleaner.</p>
      <p>“His link-up play has definitely improved, and he’s kept his edge without getting embroiled too many situations which is really important.”</p>
