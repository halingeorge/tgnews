      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stacey-solomon">Stacey Solomon</a> seems to be having a thrifty Christmas as she's revealed she did her shopping in a bargain store.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old TV personality took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to show her followers her favourite buys from the budget shop.</p>
      <p>But a small hashtag in some of the videos said #iworkwithprimark, meaning she was being paid to advertise their products to her followers.</p>
      <p>Mum of three Stacey explained she started her Christmas shopping early because she "can't face shopping in December".</p>
      <p>"I need to do it now or I'll never get it done", she added.</p>
      <p>"The first shop I went into was Primark", she said.</p>

      <p>"I am going to brand partnership these ones but that doesn't take away from the fact I genuinely shop in there and that's where I get most of my stuff."</p>
      <p>Stacey is mum to Zachary, 11, Leighton, seven, and Rex, six months.</p>
      <p>She explained that the older two prefer getting vouchers for Christmas, but she bought them some small stocking fillers and a Playstation controller alarm clock.</p>
      <p>"So I won't have to wake them up any more!", she laughed.</p>

      <p>Stacey bought some £3 Christmassy candle holders and a decorative wooden frame worth £6.</p>
      <p>She also got matching Christmas pyjamas for the family including fluffy boot slippers that she lined up in a row for the photo.</p>
      <p>For her nieces who are "Frozen obsessed", she got an Elsa jumper and some Frozen stamps, and some pyjamas.</p>
      <p>Stacey also revealed she had bought her sisters Jemma and Samantha earrings from budget jewellers Warren James.</p>

      <p>"They're all real silver but it's just so cheap", she said, having spent £9.99 altogether on her sisters.</p>
      <p>She added that the shop charges for boxes, so she bought the gifts without a box and will recycle boxes she already owns.</p>
      <p>The organised TV star also posted a photo of her to do list for Christmas gifts where she ticked off the people she had bought gifts for.</p>

      <p>She credited the idea to Mrs Hinch, who advises her followers to keep an activity journal.</p>
      <p>Stacey tuned into I'm a Celebrity last night and lamented her partner <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/joe-swash">Joe Swash</a> no longer presenting Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>Instead of seeing her boyfriend's smiling face, Joel Dommett was joined by new presenters <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/emily-atack">Emily Atack</a> and Adam Thomas.</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> during the episode, she wrote with crying emojis: "Soooo wierd watching #ExtraCamp without you @realjoeswash."</p>
      <p>Ever since he won I'm A Celebrity in 2008, Joe has presented the ITV2 spin-off show for the main programme.</p>
      <p>But Joe is busy training for his appearance on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dancing-on-ice">Dancing On Ice</a> ahead of its launch in January.</p>
