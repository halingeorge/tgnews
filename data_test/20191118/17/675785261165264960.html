      <p>A quick-thinking bodyguard was captured on CCTV protecting his female client from an attacker posing as a pizza delivery courier.</p>
      <p>The attempted attack took place at around 2pm in the entrance of hotel Santa Fe in Mexico’s central capital Mexico City.</p>
      <p>In the footage the bodyguard can be seen shadowing the woman as she walks around a black SUV and unloads her bags.</p>
      <p>A man on a motorbike cruises into the hotel grounds and pulls up close behind the SUV when the bodyguard - already on high alert - places himself between the woman and the attacker.</p>
      <p>The attacker quickly moves to get closer to the woman and pulls something out of his pocket, prompting the woman to run inside and the bodyguard to draw his gun.</p>
