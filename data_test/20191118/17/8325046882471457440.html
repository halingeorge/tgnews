      <p>A lot of Hollywood entertainers are extremely wealthy – but fewer than you might think are actually billionaires. What sets these five billionaire entertainers and studio executives apart from their peers is not only that they excelled in the industry, but that they leveraged their success to make investments that provide significant income beyond their salaries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/hollywood">Hollywood’s</a> billionaires’ club may not stay small for long, however, as more and more stars launch their own clothing and beauty lines.

      <p>Jenner made headlines in March after Forbes declared her the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-jenner-becomes-youngest-self-made-billionaire-2019-3">youngest self-made billionaire ever</a> at 21.

      <p>Jenner began appearing on her family’s reality television show, “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” at age 10 and has since built a massive social media following so influential that shares of Snap <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/snap-stock-price-kylie-jenner-tweets-she-doesnt-use-snapchat-anymore-2018-2-1016720438?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">fell 7% after she tweeted</a> that she had stopped using the app in 2018.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Born to a single mother in rural Mississippi, Winfrey started out as a news anchor before spending 25 years hosting “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” The investments Winfrey made with her share of the show’s profits are now worth about $2 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/oprah-winfrey/?list=billionaires#4d25a16b5745">Forbes</a> estimates. She became a billionaire in 2003, according to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-feb-28-fi-rup28.3-story.html">the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p>
      <p>Winfrey, now 65, also leveraged her show’s success to build a media empire and amassed a fortune of $2.6 billion in the process, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/oprah-winfrey/?list=billionaires#4d25a16b5745">Forbes</a>.

      </figure>
      <p>The box office success of “Jaws,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” and “Jurassic Park,” among others, have made Spielberg the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/highest-earning-movie-directors-of-all-time-us-box-office-2017-8">top-grossing director of all time</a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/steven-spielberg/#45c79bff228a">Forbes</a>, most of Spielberg’s fortune comes from his films, but he has also profited from his role as a consultant for Universal theme parks and the sale of DreamWorks Animation to NBCUniversal for $3.8 billion in 2016.</p>
      <p>Spielberg, 72, co-founded DreamWorks Pictures alongside Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/george-lucas/#3fa0d3666e63">Lucas</a>, 75, may be the brains behind two of the most well-known film franchises of our time, but he made most of his money by selling his production studio Lucasfilm to Disney for $4.05 billion in cash and stock in 2012, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/george-w-lucas/">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>Lucas also executive produced “The Land Before Time” and wrote “American Graffiti,” according to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000184/">IMDb</a>. His biggest-grossing film, “Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace,” brought in $474 million at the box office.</p>
      <p>While Lucas originally aspired to be a racecar driver, he decided to pursue filmmaking <a href="https://www.biography.com/news/george-lucas-car-crash-star-wars">after nearly dying in a car crash</a>. Lucas studied filmmaking at USC before founding Lucasfilm, according to the <a href="https://cinema.usc.edu/assets/007/5766.pdf">university’s website</a>. Lucas retired from his studio in 2012 in order to turn his attention to independent films, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/magazine/george-lucas-red-tails.html?auth=login-email">The New York Times</a>.</p>
