      <p>An artist carried out a prank this weekend that was seemingly designed to make Apple fans’ blood pressure spike.</p>
      <p>Pablo Rochat, a San Francisco-based artist, printed out dozens of life-sized stickers designed to look like Airpods and stuck them to the ground all over the city.</p>
      <p>The prank was primarily intended to catch people’s attention and cause them to do a double-take, Rochat told Business Insider.</p>
      <p>“Most people found it funny, but a few people were pissed that they got pranked,” Rochat said.</p>
