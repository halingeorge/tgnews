      <p>Chinese mobile-maker Vivo launched the new mid-range Y19 series phone on November 18 in India.</p>
      <p>As mentioned in the headline, the key highlight feature of the new Vivo Y19 is the photography hardware. It boasts a triple camera module-- a primary 16MP (F1.78 aperture), secondary 8MP (F2.2) and a 2MP (F2.4) for macro shots-- on rear-side with LED flash. On the front, it houses equally impressive 16MP (F2.0),</p>
      <p>Besides the usual photo and video recording, the <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/specials/vivo-s5-with-quad-camera-unveiled-776459.html">Vivo </a>Y19 also supports several photography experience-enhancing features such as Portrait (AI Face Beauty), Professional, Panorama, Slow motion, Time-Lapse, HDR, Bokeh, Super wide-angle, Super Macro, Time watermark, Model watermark, Camera filters, Grid, Timer, DOC, AR Stickers and Live Photo.</p>
      <p>Another notable aspect of the Vivo Y19 is the 5,000mAh battery, which is more than enough to keep the phone running for one-and-half days easily under mixed usage. The retail package also comes with an 18W fast charger. </p>
