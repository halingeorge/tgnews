      <h1>House investigating if Trump lied to Mueller in written testimony</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:58:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jerry Dunleavy  &amp; Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>The House of Representatives' general counsel said that the body is now investigating whether President Trump lied to former special counsel Robert Mueller in written answers related to the investigation into Russian election interference.</p>
      <p>Counsel Douglas Letter told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Monday that the House is requesting access to grand jury material that Mueller gathered during his 22-month investigation into the 2016 presidential election.</p>
      <p>“Did the president lie? Was the president not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?” Letter <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/house-investigating-trump-lying-to-mueller/index.html">asked</a> the court.</p>
      <p>Former Trump associate Roger Stone <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dirty-trickster-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-lying-to-congress-in-wikileaks-case">was the latest to be convicted of crimes</a> stemming from Mueller’s investigation. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/rick-gates-roger-stone-told-campaign-and-trump-himself-about-wikileaks-disclosures">Testifying in the D.C. district court</a> case against Stone last week, former Trump campaign official Rick Gates said then-candidate Trump told him more information would be coming from WikiLeaks after Trump had a late July 2016 call with Stone.</p>
      <p>Gates described a car ride with two Secret Service members from Trump Tower to a waiting airplane at LaGuardia Airport with the future president a few days after the release of thousands of Democratic emails by WikiLeaks. He told the jury that he could tell from the incoming number that Stone had called Trump and that he could hear Stone's voice but “did not hear” what was being said by Stone during the call.</p>
      <p>Gates testified that, when the call ended, Trump then “indicated that more information would be coming” from WikiLeaks.</p>
      <p>Mueller’s team asked Trump in 2018 if he could recall Stone or any other campaign associates “having any discussions, directly or indirectly, with WikiLeaks … regarding the content or timing of release of hacked emails.”</p>
      <p>“I do not recall being told during the campaign that Roger Stone or anyone associated with my campaign had discussions with any of the entities named in the question regarding the content or timing of release of hacked emails,” Trump responded.</p>
      <p>Mueller also asked Trump whether Stone ever discussed WikiLeaks with him or with anyone else associated with the campaign and whether Stone informed Trump “about contacts he had with WikiLeaks or any intermediary of WikiLeaks or about forthcoming releases of information.”</p>
      <p>But Trump dodged the question and said he didn’t remember.</p>
      <p>“I spoke by telephone with Roger Stone from time to time during the campaign,” Trump told Mueller. “I have no recollection of the specifics of any conversations I had with Mr. Stone between June 1, 2016, and November 8, 2016. I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him, nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.”</p>
      <p>The Trump campaign viewed Stone as their “access point” to WikiLeaks and founder Julian Assange in their hunt for information to hurt Hillary Clinton, former Trump campaign CEO <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bannon-trump-campaign-saw-roger-stone-as-link-to-wikileaks-and-assange">Steve Bannon testified during Stone’s trial</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think it was generally believed that the access point or the potential access point to WikiLeaks was Roger Stone,” Bannon said. “The campaign had no official access to WikiLeaks or Julian Assange, but Roger would be viewed as an access point because Roger told me he had a relationship with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.”</p>
      <p>Mueller’s report found no evidence that Trump conspired with Russia during the election. The former special counsel declined to decide whether Trump obstructed justice, despite <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/10-times-trump-might-have-obstructed-justice">laying out 10 possible scenarios in his report</a>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Examiner</i> reached out to the Department of Justice for comment but did not immediately receive a response.</p>
