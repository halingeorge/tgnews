      <h3>Teresa Giudice Leaves Bravo Event Early To Rush Her Dad To The Hospital</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/teresa-giudice/">Teresa Giudice</a>, along with many Bravo stars, appeared at BravoCon 2019 in New York City, but the star of The Real Housewives of New Jersey was forced to leave the big event to rush to be with her father in the hospital. According to <i><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teresa-giudice-leaves-bravocon-2019-early-to-rush-dad-to-hospital/">Us Magazine,</a></i> Teresa posted a video with an ambulance in the background to her Instagram stories, explaining why she had to leave early.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, BravoCon fans. I had to leave,” she said. “My dad doesn’t feel well. I’m taking him to the hospital.”</p>
      <p>Teresa deleted the video after posting it, though her story shows other events at the three-day BravoCon gathering. Since then, she hasn’t posted an update on her dad’s situation, but it’s not the first time that Giancito Gorga has been rushed to the hospital this year. A source close to the family confirmed that he is still under medical care as of Monday morning.</p>
      <p>“He’s still at the hospital. He has had multiple trips this year for similar issues,” the source said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, husband Joe Giudice posted a few images that showed Giacinto dancing and singing. Neither video had a caption to accompany it, however.</p>
      <p>Giacinto was hospitalized in November, 2017 for complications associated with pneumonia. At the time, the news was particularly concerning for the family after losing Antonia Gorga, Teresa’s mother, to pneumonia just a few months prior. She was 66 when she passed. Giacinto was hospitalized again in October 2018 for the same issue.</p>

      <p>Joe has been <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5745550/rhonj-teresa-giudice-husband-joe-facetime/">staying in touch with the family via FaceTime</a> after being deported from the U.S. to his native Italy as the result of a federal fraud conviction for which he served time behind bars. Recently, Teresa and their four daughters traveled to Italy to visit their father. Rumors have plagued the couple since Joe went to prison and his deportation order was announced, that the pair would separate if he was forced to leave the country.</p>

      <p>Teresa herself has left the option of a separation on the table, saying that she didn’t want to uproot her children’s lives to move to Italy.</p>
      <p>While appearing at BravoCon, Teresa spoke with Andy Cohen about the trip to Italy, which appears to have been positive for the couple.</p>
      <p>“It was an amazing, amazing trip,” she said. “I’m so happy Joe’s free. It was very emotional. I was overwhelmed with joy. I was happy to see my daughters finally united with their dad.”</p>
