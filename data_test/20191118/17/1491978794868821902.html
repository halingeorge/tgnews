      <h1>Pregnant and waiting for your baby? Forget sex and hot baths – here's my advice</h1>

      <p>My daughter has passed her due date and we are all on tenterhooks for the baby to be born. What a strange space this is. Constantly texting – “Anything?” – is probably not the best idea. I am simply waiting for the call. But still, this is yet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/21/how-to-plan-your-perfect-birth-all-the-options-you-need-to-know">another part of a woman’s life </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/21/how-to-plan-your-perfect-birth-all-the-options-you-need-to-know">in which one is bombarded</a> with weird and contradictory advice.</p>
      <p>I thought it would have changed over the years, but no, it’s much the same. Sex. Curry. Various kinds of herbs.</p>
      <p>None of this sort of advice is shown to work, and while one woman I hardly know came up to me in the street and told me to tell my daughter to exercise, another recommended a relaxing hot bath.</p>
      <p>When I had my first child, I had to go into hospital to be induced for no apparent reason, and was so bored I discharged myself. “Refused medical advice” was written on my notes. This was by the same nasty doctor who told me I had no pulse.</p>
      <p>Instead, I resorted to some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/26/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety">Our Bodies, Ourselves</a>-type feminist manual, which recommended a bottle of castor oil mixed with a tin of Andrews Liver Salts and some orange juice. This appalling cocktail produced deeply unpleasant results, but no baby. This was the only time I wrote letters of complaint to newspapers – as I was going out of my mind.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, my daughter appeared in her own time. As babies tend to.</p>
      <p>The current advice involves nipple stimulation, acupuncture, bananas and bouncing on an exercise ball. Whatever.</p>
      <p>My own advice is different. Go to see a film or waddle around a gallery. It will be some time before you can do those things again alone. This is your time, this waiting game. Your new life will happen soon enough. Trust me.</p>
