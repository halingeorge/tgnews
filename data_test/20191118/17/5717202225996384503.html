      <h1>Report: Tottenham face Real Madrid battle for Andre Onana</h1>
      <h2>Andre Onana recently signed a long-term contract with Ajax.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:15:29+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur target Andre Onana is now on Real Madrid’s radar, according to reports in Europe.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/europa/tmw-ajax-rimandato-addio-van-de-beek-il-real-punta-anche-onana-1315596">As per this report by Tutto Mercato Web</a>, Real Madrid are targeting Ajax goalkeeper Onana. This could be a blow for Tottenham, who reportedly want the impressive stopper.</p>
      <p>Onana has been with Ajax since he joined the academy in 2010. The Cameroon international is rated as one of the best goalkeepers across Europe at the moment.</p>
      <p>With over 150 senior appearances for Ajax under his belt, Onana has firmly established himself as the Eredivisie giant’s first-choice goalkeeper. But Tottenham want to woo him to England.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10267134/tottenham-eye-35m-january-transfer-andre-onana/">According to a recent report by The Sun</a>, Spurs are plotting a £35m January swoop for Onana. Hugo Lloris is currently out injured and he is not due back until next year. Tottenham are already thinking about his long-term replacement and Onana fits the bill.</p>
      <p>But Real Madrid are also reportedly keen on Onana. Zinedine Zidane’s men want the 23-year-old to battle Thibaut Courtois for the goalkeeper spot.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Tottenham are hoping that Onana solves their long-term problems between the sticks. While Paulo Gazzaniga has deputised admirably in Lloris’ absence, Onana is an exciting talent who cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p>But Real Madrid put a spanner in the works here. Onana might be tempted to the Spanish capital if the interest is backed up with a concrete bid. This is why Spurs have to act quickly if they are serious.</p>
