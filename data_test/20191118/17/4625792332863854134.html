      <h1>Meghan McCain: 'I believe' Trump administration officials are using the West 'as a slush fund' for Putin</h1>

      <p><i>The View</i> co-host Meghan McCain alleged that some members of the Trump administration are using their positions to establish a "slush fund" for Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/meghan-mccain-trashes-wannabe-tv-star-matt-gaetz-for-sit-in-tactic">McCain</a>, 35, made the comment during a brief moment on Monday's show in which she addressed her presentation of the Magnitsky Award to Oleg Sentsov, who was imprisoned in Russia for coming out against Russia's annexation of Crimea, last week.</p>
      <p>"I was at the Magnitsky Human Rights Awards in London, and Sergei Magnitsky was someone who found corruption in Russia, was subsequently tortured and killed because of it, and there is now an act that is in the United States, and we’re trying to make it expand globally where basically Russia can’t use the West and democracy for their dirty money, that they can’t launder it in countries that love and utilize democracy and freedom every single day," she said.</p>
      <p>Before the show went to a commercial break, she added, "I believe there are people in the Trump administration that are trying to use the West as a slush fund for Vladimir Putin and Russia, and we cannot let it happen."</p>
      <p>Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya previously revealed that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/russian-lawyer-donald-trump-jr-said-magnitsky-act-could-be-reconsidered-if-trump-won">she and Donald Trump Jr</a>. discussed the reexamination of the Magnitsky law, which McCain referenced, during the 2016 Trump Tower meeting prior to Trump's election.</p>
