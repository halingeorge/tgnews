      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- An Indian Forest Service officer shared video of a leopard lunging at a motorcycle, missing the vehicle and its two riders by what appears to be a matter of inches.</p>
      <p>The video, <a href="https://twitter.com/susantananda3/status/1195317113168097281">tweeted</a> by IFS Officer Susanta Nanda, shows the leopard standing at the side of the road and dashing into the road when the motorcycle approaches.</p>
      <p>The leopard <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/watch-two-wheeler-nearly-escapes-attack-of-a-leopard-as-it-tries-to-pounce-on-riders-2391193.html">pounces toward the vehicle</a>, which is ridden by two men, but misses by a small margin.</p>
      <p>Nanda said the video was filmed by a driver who had stopped to give a safe distance to the leopard, but the motorcycle had gone around other vehicles to cross the animal's path.</p>
      <p>"All were waiting to give right of way to its real owner, the leopard, when a motorcyclist wanted to have his way. Would have been his last ride," Nanda wrote. "Please learn to respect the wild."</p>
