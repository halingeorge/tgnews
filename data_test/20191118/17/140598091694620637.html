      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:54:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/sam-dean/" target="_blank">Sam Dean</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale hopes to recapture the “euphoria” of qualifying for Euro 2016 as Wales go in search of a victory that will guarantee their place at next summer’s European Championships.</p>
      <p>Wales meet Hungary on Tuesday night knowing that a win would be enough to confirm their place at the tournament, with Bale saying qualification could be an even more impressive achievement than reaching Euro 2016.</p>
      <p>The European Championships in France, when Wales were defeated in the semi-finals, was the country’s first international tournament in 58 years and Bale said the experience of qualifying four years ago will work in his side’s favour in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>“We have got the euphoria of qualifying for our first Euros and doing so well at that competition that we really want to do it again,” said Bale. “We have also got the negatives of knowing how it feels to miss out on qualifying for a tournament like we did with the [2018] World Cup.</p>
      <p>“We can see how we don’t want to feel after the game. We know prior to this game we can push and push not to feel like that again, because it is not a feeling you want in the dressing room after the game.”</p>

      <p>Bale, who has said he feels more excited playing for Wales than for Real Madrid, added that qualifying for Euro 2020 would be “right up there” alongside his proudest career achievements.</p>
      <p>“The experience of qualifying for the Euros was massive and something I have never done before and to do it again might be a bit more impressive,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is going to stand in equal stead as last time but we can’t think about that just yet. We have another important match first and we have to focus on that as a team and as a squad.”</p>
      <p>For the first time in this campaign, Ryan Giggs will be able to use both Bale and Aaron Ramsey from the off, with the Wales manager confirming that his star players are ready to start against a Hungary side which can also guarantee qualification with a win.</p>
      <p>Ramsey made his first appearance in Euro 2020 qualifying in this weekend’s victory over Azerbaijan, coming on as a substitute in the second half. He and Bale have not lost a qualifier while playing together since 2015 and they will be expected to lead the charge at the Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>Wales have rebuilt their momentum after a defeat by Hungary in June left them with just three points from their first three matches.</p>
      <p>“We have to show the belief we have shown and be brave on the ball,” said Giggs. “It is going to be an exciting night and one that all the players are looking forward to. We have got that momentum. I believe in the players and the qualities they possess.</p>
      <p>"We have put ourselves in a great position. It is in our hands and it’s a great challenge for us. We need to finish the job. It’s about the country as a whole, getting to a major championships. If we can recreate that atmosphere [of 2016] it will be fantastic.”</p>
