      <p>There'd been a serious baptism of fire for this year's I'm A Celebrity camp mates as a ferocious thunderstorm has battered the jungle.</p>
      <p>While us here in the UK have been told to brace ourselves for some rather unpleasant weather over the next week, the I'm A Celebrity stars, which include Ian Wright, Nadine Coyle and Caitlyn Jenner, have been left drenched as heavy winds, rain and even hail have swept through the main camp and the 'rough camp', where the majority of the camp mates are living at the moment after losing out in the 'power pairs' challenges.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/im-celeb-camp-battered-heavy-20907096">The Mirror,</a> The TV show's set, located in a national park south of Brisbane, suffered a deluge as storms gathered over the area.</p>
      <p>Last year's star John Barrowman was there to record Extra Camp and he filmed the appalling weather from his hotel room late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The clip shows lightning and heavy rain over the jungle where the camp is based, with the trees around the buildings being whipped around by strong winds.</p>
      <p>John wrote on the video: "Huge rain storm. Thinking about the I'm A Celebrity campmates right now."</p>
      <p>He added in a caption: "It's a huge storm... Not so fabulous for the campmates."</p>
      <p>Reports from local news over in Australia suggest some hailstones the size of cricket balls knocked out power lines and brought traffic to a standstill.</p>
      <p>This is in stark contrast to the bush fires that continue to rage Down Under and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-bush-fires-17272182">have forced the abandonment of camp fires</a> for the first time in I'm A Celebrity's 17 year history.</p>
      <p>Instead this year's celebs will cook their meals on gas stoves.</p>
