      <h1>French libel trial opens against alleged sex assault victim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:20:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>A French writer reaffirmed in court Monday her accusation of sexual assault by a former minister, who is suing her for libel in a case critics see as an attempt to discourage abuse victims from speaking out.</p>
      <p>In 2017, as the #MeToo movement was spurring hundreds of women to denounce abusive behaviour, French writer Ariane Fornia accused the top Socialist figure and advisor to ex-president Francois Mitterrand of assault while attending the Opera Bastille in Paris in 2010.</p>
      <p>Former defence and interior minister Pierre Joxe, now 84, has angrily denied the charge and demanded a public apology. He filed his libel suit after Fornia refused.</p>
      <p>The case, which opened in Paris court Monday, is being closely watched after the founder of France's #MeToo campaign Sandra Muller was convicted in September of defaming the man she accused of sex harassment in a viral Twitter post.</p>
      <p>Muller, a journalist, was ordered to pay 15,000 euros ($16,600) as well as legal fees to a French TV executive she said had made sexually lewd remarks at a party.</p>
      <p>The alleged assault by Joxe is beyond France's statute of limitations, so no inquiry was opened into the claim.</p>
      <p>"I fully stand behind what I said as the exact truth, and I am certain that Mr Joxe knows it perfectly well," Fornia told the court Monday.</p>
      <p>She said Joxe touched her leg several times trying to get under her dress during the opera performance.</p>
      <p>Joxe said he was "even more outraged than two years ago," while his lawyer questioned the accuracy of several details in Fornia's original account of the allegations in her blog.</p>
      <p>A court said it will issue its ruling on January 22.</p>
      <p>Joxe is seeking one euro in symbolic damages but also 5,000 euros in legal fees and the deleting of the content from her blog.</p>
      <p>The hearing came just days after a former carer assisting Joxe's wife at their home accused him of sexual aggression and harassment, from September 2017 to December 2018.</p>
      <p>The woman, a 40-year-old from Haiti, has filed a lawsuit and the Paris prosecutor's office said Wednesday that an investigation was underway.</p>
      <p>"As if by chance, this story, even more absurd than the other, comes a few days before the Paris court hearing," Joxe told AFP last week.</p>
      <p>His lawyer, Jean-Yves Dupeux, told AFP that "my client strongly rejects these accusations and will prove that they are false."</p>
