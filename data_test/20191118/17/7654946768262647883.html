      <p>Prepare to hear chants of “Olé” throughout Monday night’s AFC West battle between the Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs in Mexico City (8:15 p.m., ESPN). The Chiefs play defense like matadors.</p>
      <p>Kansas City:</p>
      <p>Allowed 7.6 yards per play last week to Tennessee in a 35-32 loss. The Titans rushed for 225 yards on just 26 carries, including a 68-yard touchdown sprint from Derrick Henry.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Recently allowed 256 passing yards to Aaron Rodgers and 62 percent third-down conversions in a 31-24 home loss to the Packers, whose game-winner came on a 67-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to Aaron Jones.</li>
        <li>Was bullied in its prior home game by the Houston Texans to the tune of 472 yards allowed — 280 in the air and 192 on the ground — in another 31-24 loss.</li>
        <li>Let the Colts rush for 180 yards and own time of possession 37:15 to 22:45 in an earlier home upset.</li>
        <li>Needed a fumble-return touchdown to win at Detroit while allowing 447 total yards (186 on the ground) and 6.1 yards-per-play.</li>
        <li>Allowed 452 yards — 249 in the air and 201 on the ground — in a shootout victory over the Ravens.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In their last eight games, the Chiefs allowed opponents to score touchdowns on 62 percent of their red-zone trips. It’s 69 percent if you throw out the sluggish Colts (Titans 2-for-2, Vikings 3-for-4, Packers 3-for-4, Broncos 1-for-2, Texans 4-for-6, Lions 3-for-6, Ravens 4-for-5).</p>
      <p>Passing offenses can throw the ball on the Chiefs. Rushing offenses can run the ball. Balanced offenses can do what they want, particularly close to the goal line. Limited offenses can at least control the clock.</p>
      <p>If “defense wins championships,” it’s hard to see Kansas City as a legitimate threat to the New England Patriots in the AFC. The Chiefs are trending away from being a threat to any other playoff team.</p>
      <p>Bettors know the Chiefs are 2-5 against the spread in their last seven games. And you can’t blame that on the injury to star quarterback Patrick Mahomes. They went 2-1 ATS in games finished by backup Matt Moore, 0-4 ATS otherwise.</p>
      <p>The good news for the Chiefs on Monday is that the opposing Chargers have a knack for playing exciting games … then losing them. Quarterback Philip Rivers should put up some numbers (pending turf conditions). He could put the AFC West race in turmoil by leading an upset that would pull the Chargers within one game of the lead.</p>
      <p>Sharps have shown support for Rivers and the Chargers at the earliest opener of +4¹/₂ and at +4. Whenever sportsbooks drop to 3¹/₂, money does come in on the favored Chiefs. The public has seen enough crazy Chargers finishes that recreational bettors will probably prefer seemingly “safer” Kansas City at a cheap price leading up to kickoff. Sharps like the dog at +4 or better.</p>
      <p>Matadors are celebrated at Plaza de Toros. At Estadio Azteca, the Chiefs will have to play better defense to cover. That’s no bull.</p>
