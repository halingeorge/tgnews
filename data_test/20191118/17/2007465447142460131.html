      <h1>Hours after reveal, 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage, Mirage G4 get kitted out</h1>
      <h2>Check out these factory kits for the 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage and Mirage G4</h2>

      <p>It has only been a few hours after Mitsubishi launched the 2020 Mirage and Mirage G4, and they didn't waste any time kitting out their subcompacts. With their totally new look, Mitsubishi has released in a new range of kits to better suit both the Mirage and the Mirage G4.</p>

      <p>For the Mirage hatchback, it gets a deeper front chin and red highlights on the grill to add a bit of zing on the exterior. The hatch also gets chrome extensions on the headlight corners to make the lights themselves appear longer than standard. Gloss black wheels are also part of the package, along with more chrome on the tail lights and tailgate. The rear bumper also gets a kit, making it look lowered.</p>

      <p>On to the sedan and it gets a similar treatment as the hatchback. A deeper front chin, as well as chrome extentions on the lights are present on the car. The difference here is that the sedan gets more chrome than on the hatchback - these are seen on the grill and lower apron. There are no red highlights here either; reason for which is to position the Mirage G4 in a slightly more premium part of the market. As this is the sedan, it has a different rear bumper kit and it also comes with a trunk spoiler.</p>

      <p>Other accessories? You can get a dash cam, rubber floor mats, window visors, and trunk liners. No, there aren't any performance upgrades available for either car, but that's the job of the aftermarket.</p>
      <p>Given that the Mirage has already been launched in Thailand, it's not long before we see these cars in our showrooms. Hopefully, the 2020 Mirage and Mirage G4 will still be assembled in Santa Rosa, Laguna.</p>
