      <p>It was a day to remember for Lebogang Phiri as he scored the winner for Bafana Bafana in his first competitive start for the national team, and he’s described it as ‘the greatest of feelings’.</p>

      <p>Phiri proved to be the hero for South Africa at Orlando Stadium on Sunday as he smashed home the winning goal against Sudan as Molefi Ntseki picked up the first three points of his tenure in charge as head coach of Bafana. </p>
      <p>Ntseki deployed the 25-year-old in a more attacking role than he’s used to as they chased a win against the Sudanese in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier, and the EA Guingamp man repaid him with a goal in the dying embers of the first half.</p>
      <p>Phiri, who had his family in the stands watching him play, told the media after the game, “It was the greatest of feelings… Of course I’ve been anticipating getting minutes in the national team, I feel I’ve been doing exceptionally well where I’m playing, and we have great players in our country. I’ve always respected that, and I’ve always awaited my chance. </p>
      <p>“Today it came, and I did my level best. Fortunately I got the goal that got us the win, which is important, and for me, it’s just to build on and keep going forward.” </p>

      <p>Phiri will now return to France where he’ll be hoping to help his side pick up another three points on their quest to regaining promotion back in Ligue 1 for next season. </p>
