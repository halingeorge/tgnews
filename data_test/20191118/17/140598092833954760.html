      <h1>Emojis now a 'serious area of academic study' </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:37:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/mike-wright/" target="_blank">Mike Wright</a></address>
      <p>Emojis are being compared to hieroglyphics in university language courses, as a lecturer has said they are now a “serious area of study”.</p>
      <p>Philip Seargeant, a senior lecturer of applied linguistics at the Open University, said the cartoonish symbols were drawing more serious academic attention because they are “changing the way we communicate.” </p>
      <p>He also said emojis are not an entirely unprecedented linguistic phenomenon, but mirrored some functions of the world’s earliest pictorial writing systems.</p>
      <p>The Open University now runs a course called ‘A brief history of communication: hieroglyphics to emojis’ which studies the symbols’ impact on modern language.</p>
      <p>Among the areas being looked at are how emojis can be used to help people with learning difficulties and how they are studied by legal scholars for their meaning in court evidence.</p>

      <p>Dr Seargeant, who has written a book on the subject called The Emoji Revolution, said: “There is definitely a build up of serious work being done about [emojis] and people studying it. I think in the past, people found it interesting to teach as a slightly unusual youth culture type thing. </p>
      <p>“But now there is a serious aspect to it, as it is penetrating into so many other ways in which we communicate.”</p>
      <p>The lecturer said emojis shared a lineage with early writing systems, such as hieroglyphs, which started by using symbols in a simple way to represent real world items.</p>
      <p>Such systems later developed symbols for more abstract concepts before eventually evolving into phonetic alphabets. Dr Seargeant said that today's emojis are similarly used as a visual shorthand. However, he said they had also evolved a unique function of adding emotional context modern fast-paced, text-based conversations. </p>
      <p>He added: “The emoji that are the most popular are the ones about emotions, so the smile and so forth. The ones about the objects, such as the gas station, are less used.” </p>
