      <h1>Habs forwards Drouin, Byron to undergo surgery, will be out indefinitely</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:11:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>Montreal Canadiens coach Claude Julien says forwards Jonathan Drouin and Paul Byron are scheduled to undergo surgery and will be out indefinitely.</p>
      <p>Drouin suffered a wrist injury and Byron hurt his knee in the Canadiens' 5-2 win at Washington on Friday.</p>
      <p>Drouin was levelled by a thunderous check by Capitals star Alex Ovechkin in the second period, though the Canadiens say his injury came from an unrelated play in the third period.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, he's one of our best players," Canadiens forward Max Domi said. "To be missing him now, it's a tough pill to swallow. Other guys are going to have to step up. ... We all know we have the character in here for guys to step up.</p>
      <p>"When someone goes down, it gives the opportunity for someone else. When you have the depth we have, it's a good opportunity for guys to prove some stuff here."</p>
      <p>Canadiens coach Claude Julien said the team hopes to have more specific timelines within a few days.</p>
      <p>He acknowledged it's a tough blow for Drouin, who was off to a strong start with seven goals and eight assists in 19 games.</p>
      <p>"We're in a sport where injuries unfortunately happen," Julien said. "We're just going to hope it's shorter than longer and we're going to hope he comes back the way he left us."</p>
      <p>Byron limped to the locker room late in the game at Washington. He has one goal and three assists.</p>
      <p>The Canadiens recalled forward Charles Hudon from AHL Laval to help bolster the ranks.</p>
      <p>"Injuries are going to happen along the way," Canadiens defenceman Jeff Petry said. "It's our responsibility in here for each guy to step up a little bit and pick up a little bit more to take care of that."</p>
      <p>Montreal, riding a six-game point streak, is in Columbus on Tuesday to face the Blue Jackets before returning home to meet the Ottawa Senators on Wednesday.</p>
