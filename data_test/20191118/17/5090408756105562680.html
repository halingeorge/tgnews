      <p>Bella Hadid is no stranger to making daring fashion choices.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the model attended a photo-call for the Vogue Fashion Festival in Paris, France, wearing an unconventional look. She donned a brown tank top with detached long sleeves and a knot at the waist, as well as unbuttoned jeans with leather panels attached to each pant leg.</p>
      <p>Hadid’s top was designed by Chrome Hearts, and her pants were created by Alexander Wang.</p>

      <p>To complete her look, Hadid wore one of the year’s biggest shoe trends: <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g28625253/square-toe-shoes-boots-trend/">square-toed heels</a>. Her shoes were seemingly made from leather, though they were almost entirely covered by her oversized jeans.</p>
      <p>In addition to her unique ensemble, the model also wore two cross necklaces and a silver ring. Her hair, on the other hand, was styled in a rounded bob.</p>

      <p>That same day, Hadid wore yet another striking outfit. While at the Vogue Fashion Festival, she wore a Supriya Lele leather coat <a href="https://www.insider.com/bella-hadid-wears-no-shirt-trend-2019-11">with no shirt underneath</a>. The jacket reached her knees, and was held together with two tiny strings tied across her chest.</p>
      <p>She also wore pointed leather boots, and trousers that had an uneven waistline held up by criss-cross strings that extended across her stomach.</p>

      <p>On November 4, Hadid showed her affinity for Alexander Wang designs once again in a <a href="https://www.insider.com/bella-hadid-body-piercing-outfit-2019-11">black jumpsuit embellished with pearls</a>. The jewels were strategically placed across her chest and stomach, and therefore resembled both nipple and belly-button piercings.</p>
      <p>She wore the outfit to the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Awards in New York City.</p>
