      <p>“When I heard [she was taking legal action], I was like ‘Bravo. Good for her,'” Campbell shared. </p>
      <p>She also suggested there is an element of racism attached to the negative coverage of Markle. Campbell compared Markle’s situation to the treatment of Serena Williams and others.</p>

      <p>“We all know what that’s about,” she said. “I’ve seen how they treat Raheem Sterling, how they speak about Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams. I don’t know how Meghan Markle deals with this and I’m really glad she’s taken action to defend herself.”</p>
      <p>Markle and her husband Prince Harry are taking legal action against <i>The Mail on Sunday </i>and Associated Papers which owns the tabloid. The Duke and Duchess cite alleged misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
