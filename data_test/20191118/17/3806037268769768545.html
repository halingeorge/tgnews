      <h1>Lauren Tsai Unveils First-Ever 'UNREAL' Sculpture with Medicom Toy</h1>
      <h2>Releasing exclusively at DesignerCon 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:05:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Estiler</a></address>
      <p>Multifaceted artist and model <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lauren-tsai">Lauren Tsai</a> teamed up with Medicom Toy to release her first-ever sculpture edition entitled ‘UNREAL.’ Inspired by an original illustration made by Tsai, the polystone artwork portrays a surrealist creature complete with tentacle-like horns, octopus skin on its back, and human heads protruding across its wave-like breast. The sculpture took about a year and a half to develop.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been drawing this dragon since I was a little kid. It has grown, changed colors and faces, and sprouted new parts over time. This character is close to my heart because it brings me back to how free my mind felt to dream when I first started drawing it,” said Tsai to HYPEBEAST. “I’m thrilled to see it come to life now, I hope it can bring you the same kinds of feelings too.”</p>
      <p>Get a closer look at Lauren Tsai’s ‘UNREAL’ sculpture above. The collaborative edition will be available exclusively at Medicom Toy’s booth at <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/designercon-2019-exclusive-toys-info">DesignerCon 2019</a> from November 22-24.
