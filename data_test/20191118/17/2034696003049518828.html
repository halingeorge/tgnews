      <p>ICYMI: we now have two radio channels here at <i>NME</i>! You can tune into NME 1 for a selection of stone-cold classics and indie anthems, while NME 2 will bring you the best of the past decade — from alternative bops to grime and leftfield dance.</p>
      <p>Each week Team <i>NME</i> carefully handpick a selection of tunes to add to both playlists — here are the <a href="https://www.nme.com/audio">NME 1 &amp; 2</a> playlist additions for this week.</p>
      <h3>On the A List</h3>
      <h4>Billie Eilish – ‘Everything I Wanted’</h4>
      <p>First on the playlist this week we have the new one from Billie Eilish. The teenage star’s first piece of new music since her excellent debut album ‘When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?’ is a haunting fusion of her trademark whispered vocals and crisp electrical production. A total eerie earworm, and we love it.</p>

      <h4>J Hus – ‘Must Be’</h4>
      <p>Next up we’ve got the new one from J Hus, and the rapper’s highly anticipated comeback song is a belter. Combining his wicked lyricism with slick, afro-swing instrumentals, he’s created another winner.</p>

      <h3>On the B List</h3>
      <h4>Biig Piig – ‘Roses and Gold’</h4>
      <p>Blending lilting house beats with gorgeous hazy production, Biig Piig’s latest is a slice of blissful summer in the middle of this grey November.</p>

      <h4>Glass Animals &amp; Denzel Curry – ‘Tokyo Drifting’</h4>
      <p>It’s another comeback song on this week’s playlist – and this time in the form of the new one from Glass Animals and they’ve teamed up with American rapper Denzel Curry. On it vocalist Dave Bayley has created an extreme alter-ego Wavey Davey, who’s his “fucked-up Sasha Fierce”, and is “ironically flexing” over the bolshy production. With its killer brass hooks and Curry’s exquisite verse blended with Glass Animals trademark woozy production, it’s a beauty. Good to have you back, lads.</p>

      <h4>Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds – ‘Wandering Star’</h4>
      <p>Filled with jangling glockenspiels (that sounds like sleigh bells) and a punchy sing-a-long chorus, Noel’s latest is a feel-good cut of growling indie-pop.</p>

      <h4>Rosalía – ‘A Palé’</h4>
      <p>‘A Palé’ sees Rosalía mix flamenco with snarling vocals and glitchy pop, and it absolutely slaps.</p>

      <h3>On the C List</h3>
      <h4>Brother Zulu – ‘Ice Cold’</h4>
      <p>Love Tom Misch or FKJ? Then try this one from Brother Zulu. The London collective create banging future soul that combines huge funk basslines, hip-hop beats and jazzy instrumental licks, and ‘Ice Cold’ is one of their best.</p>

      <h4>Jehnny Beth – ‘I’m The Man’</h4>
      <p>Taken from the first ever <i>Peaky Blinders</i> OST, Jehnny Beth’s ‘I’m The Man’ is a standout track. She’s explained that it’s “<i>an attempted study on humankind, what we define as evil and the inner conflict of morality. Because it is much easier to label the people who are clearly tormented by obsessions as monsters than to discern the universal human background which is visible behind them.”</i> She does this with howling vocals over hulking overdriven guitars, and it’s hugely powerful.</p>

      <h4>Glowie – ‘Unlovable’</h4>
      <p>Glowie’s latest is a bloody good pop tune. With its elegant production, impossibly catchy melody and mega chorus, it’s another exciting release from the NME 100 alumni.</p>

      <h4>The Whiffs – ‘Now I Know’</h4>
      <p>Last up we’ve got the new one from The Whiffs. With its cantering punk riffs and growled vocals, ‘Now I Know’ is an exciting glimpse of what the band have coming up.</p>
