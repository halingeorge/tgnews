      <p>The first casualty - a dummy - had to be rescued quickly using a huge ladder because their condition was "unconscious and time critical", the fire service said.</p>
      <p>The second 'live' casualty also had to be saved using a ladder, while the third was stuck half-way up the massive wheel, with the specialist skills of the Bamber Bridge and Chorley rope rescue team called upon to rescue them.</p>
      <p>Pat Thompson, White Watch manager at Blackpool's Forest Gate fire station, was the officer in charge of the incident. He said: "We are extremely grateful to the team at Central Pier for letting us use their venue for a training exercise.</p>
      <p>"It is really important for our crews to be able to train at different and realistic locations and be ready for potential real-life incidents."</p>

      <p>Mr Thompson added: "The big wheel and Central Pier are iconic locations in the north west and further afield, and would no doubt attract a lot of media and public attention if an incident was to happen here.</p>
      <p>"By having these relationships in place, and whole-time and retained crews getting the opportunity to train, it means the outcome is better for all involved."</p>
      <p>Blackpool's station manager Ian Armistead was also at the exercise, while the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service's drone was also used to give the firefighters an aerial view.</p>
      <p>* The Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service is recruiting on-call firefighters until December 6. Interested parties can visit jobs.lancsfirerescue.org.uk</p>
