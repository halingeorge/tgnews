      <p>“Yet another delay” in the Trump administration's threatened U.S. ban on China's Huawei technologies, <a href="https://twitter.com/colinlecher">Colin Lecher</a> reports at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970684/huawei-us-ban-delay-trump-china">The Verge</a>.</p>
      <p>Commerce Department documents filed today show that the Trump administration’s ban on Huawei products will not go into effect for another three months, meaning the holiday shopping season profits will be far less affected.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970684/huawei-us-ban-delay-trump-china">The Verge</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Earlier this year, citing concerns of electronic espionage, the United States moved to restrict the purchase of equipment from “foreign adversaries.” The decision took aim directly at Huawei, as officials expressed concern that the Chinese government could exploit the China-based company to spy on Americans. (The company has denied any wrongdoing.)<br/><br/>But after the initial announcement, Huawei and its subsidiaries were quickly granted licenses to continue work in the US. And after one 90-day delay ended in August, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross granted another, giving rural wireless carriers that rely on Huawei products time to change their equipment.<br/><br/>The delay was again set to end this week, but according to the documents, the US will grant another extension. Barring yet another change, the ban is now set to take effect after February 16th, 2020.</blockquote>
