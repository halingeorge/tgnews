      <p>A teenage girl was electrocuted when her smartphone fell into the bath while charging.</p>
      <p>The 13-year-old girl screamed out in pain after the phone sparked in the water, prompting her mum to run into the bathroom.</p>
      <p>The Dutch girl was pulled out of the bath by her mother, who called the emergency services when her child was clear of the bathtub.</p>
      <p>When paramedics arrived at the home they punched the girl in the sternum in a successful bid to wake her up.</p>
      <p>She spent two days in hospital where she later received surgery to help heal the deep burns on her hands and stomach.</p>

      <p>The unnamed teenager's lucky escape has inspired doctors at Vrije Universiteit Medical Center in Amsterdam, where she was treated, to write about the dangers of using phones in the bath.</p>
      <p>"Risks of electrical devices in household use are underestimated," they wrote in the <a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-019-2231-4">Journal of Medical Case Reports.</a></p>
      <p>"Although products are thoroughly tested and certified, they pose a great danger if used inappropriately.</p>
      <p>"A severe electrical burn injury can cause destructive injury with high morbidity, lifelong scars and even death."</p>
      <p>Although the doctors did not accompany their warning with specific figures, they said growing smartphone usage amongst minors was making them more prone to electric shocks.</p>
      <p>The traumatic nature of the accident left the girl with amnesia and no clear idea about how she was electrocuted.</p>
      <p>Doctors have theorised that the seriousness of her injuries meant she was electrocuted by a phone connected to the the mains supply.</p>

      <p>The combination of the 240V electricity that runs through the mains supply in the Netherlands, along with moist, less resistant skin, means the accident could have proved fatal.</p>
      <p>Fortunately the quick thinking mum was on hand to unplug the phone as soon as she got into the bathroom.</p>
      <p>The wounds on the girl's hands healed after a week of fusidic acid cream treatment.</p>
      <p>Her oval-shaped burns proved harder to shift and had to be surgically rejected three weeks after the accident.</p>
      <p>In September, a Russian actress died after the phone she was charging fell in the bath.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/woman-26-electrocuted-after-phone-20079328">Evgenia Shulyatyeva</a> , 26, died within minutes after the device fell into the water she was in.</p>
      <p>Her heartbroken mum Vera found her dead at her home in Kirovo-Chepetsk, west Russia.</p>
