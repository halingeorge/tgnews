      <p>The central belt is also expected to freeze with subzero conditions overnight.</p>
      <p>There is some good news though, as temperatures are expected to rise slightly through the week.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night, mainland Scotland is predicted to have chills of between -2C and -4C, while the Hebrides and Orkney will see temperatures of 3C and 4C, respectively.</p>
      <p>And while the north of the country will still be -1C overnight on Thursday, mercury will have risen to 0C in the central belt.</p>
      <p>The cold snap comes as part of an <a href="http://bit.ly/2rUZiMc">'Arctic swell'</a> which has brought the <a href="http://bit.ly/2rUZiMc">earliest winter snow for 11 years</a> in some places.</p>

      <p>Images shared online showed snowy slopes in the Cairngorms and Glenshee resorts.</p>

      <p>Experts predict it will be the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4918094/scotland-weather-snow-coldest-november-decade/">coldest November of the decade</a>.</p>
