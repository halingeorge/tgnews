      <h1>Adobe Is Building Livestreaming Into Creative Cloud</h1>

        <b>Adobe recently announced it’s working in livestreaming for Creative Cloud apps to provide creatives with an easy way to share their work in real-time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new feature is inspired by the success of <a href="https://www.adobeapaclive.com/">Adobe Live</a> (available on <a href="https://www.behance.net/live">Behance</a> and <a href="https://wersm.com/category/other/youtube">YouTube</a>), where livestreams can run as long as three hours. Adobe claims the average watch time of Adobe Live videos is over 66 minutes!</p>
      <p>Abode has previously tested the addition of a tool timeline, allowing viewers to track which tools (and shortcuts) were used throughout an artist’s workflow. The new feature is currently in beta, and only accessible to a select group of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/fresco.html">Adobe Fresco</a> creators. Livestreaming sessions are available to audiences via a sharable link, and Adobe is encouraging viewers to watch the livestreams, engage and leave feedback, as it will help them test the feature fully before roll out to the public and other Creative Cloud apps.</p>
      <p>While this may not be something radically new, it does offer a significant improvement to Adobe users and an opportunity to connect and engage with others in-app directly; sidestepping the need for third-party apps and streaming services.</p>
      <p>It offers more than a showcase opportunity for creators. It also can pave the way for learning by enabling professionals to educate and interact in real-time with students or fans on the intricacies of digital creative production.</p>
      <p>According to Adobe Creative Cloud Chief Product Officer, Scott Belsky, this new livestreaming experience is comparable to <a href="https://wersm.com/twitch-platform-marketers-looking/">Twitch</a>, with an educational spin that enables users to filter videos based on what THEY want to learn, (i.e., how to use specific tools):</p>
      <p>“Designers say they learned by sitting next to designers, not by going to design school as much. We just need to enable that on a massive scale.”</p>
