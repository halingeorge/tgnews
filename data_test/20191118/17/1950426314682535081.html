        <b>The creepiest portion of “The Duke of York” Prince Andrew’s recent wall of denial TV interview was his strange response when asked if he had any regrets for having known international sex trafficking pimp Jeffrey Epstein.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Other than that question, Prince Andrew had an answer for everything concerning his alleged illegal relationship with Epstein’s sex slave Virginia Roberts.</p>
