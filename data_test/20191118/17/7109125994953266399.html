      <p>Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani made assurances that the legislative body is seriously pursuing people’s concerns about economic problems amid protests that erupted over the government’s recent move to ration and hike the price of gasoline. Speaking in an open session of parliament on Monday, Larijani praised Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei’s remarks over recent developments in the country as “helpful and wise” and said the Leader showed the path that the people and officials should take, and therefore all state sectors should make serious efforts to resolve the economic problems of the people. “After listening to the Leader’s deep and wise remarks, the lawmakers will … diligently pursue public concerns about economic problems,” he said, ICANA reported. Larijani pointed to the US plots against the Islamic Republic and said the Iranian lawmakers will never allow the US and its “counter-revolutionary stooges” to create chaos in the country. Following the hike in gasoline price on Friday night, a number of Iranian cities saw sporadic protests that turned violent in some cases.   Dozens of banks and government buildings were set ablaze. Officials have confirmed that at least one person has been killed in the protests. In an address on Sunday morning, Ayatollah Khamenei warned that the sporadic riots and acts of vandalism would create insecurity. Describing insecurity as the worst calamity for a society, the Leader said “all the centers of evil in the world” have mobilized efforts in recent days to encourage unrest in Iran. Ayatollah Khamenei also called on Iranian authorities to be careful that the rise in fuel price would not increase the price of other commodities. The Leader called on the people to separate themselves from a group of thugs who are encouraged by foreign-based anti-Iran groups to foment insecurity.</p>
