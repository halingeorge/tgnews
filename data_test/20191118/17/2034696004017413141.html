        <b>Aw jeez!</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/rick-and-morty"><i>Rick and Morty</i></a> fans are being given the chance to drive in a car with a giant Morty on the roof.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://turo.com/en-us/mortymobile">‘Mortymobile’</a>, which is in fact a Mazda 3 five-door hatchback, is becoming available to rent as part of a collaboration between Adult Swim and carsharing company Turo.</p>

      <p>The car will take a tour throughout a number of US cities during the run of <i>Rick and Morty</i> <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/rick-and-morty-season-4-release-date-plot-and-everything-we-know-so-far-2146711">season four</a>, starting in Los Angeles from November 18-25, followed by San Diego December 9-16.</p>
      <p>The Mortymobile, which follows the <a href="http://www.adultswim.com/rickmobile/">Rickmobile</a>, will cost $350 (£269) per day, though there’s no word yet on whether the car will tour internationally.</p>
      <p>However, proceeds from the car will be donated to an organisation that supports and empowers women in technical fields.</p>

      <p><i>Rick and Morty</i> season four premiered last week in the US, with the first episode containing <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/rick-and-morty-season-four-premiere-post-credits-scene-2566656">a post-credits scene</a> that proves crucial to the episode as a whole.</p>
      <p>The show’s UK broadcaster, E4, has since brought its release date forward after previously revealing that the first episode would not air until January 2020.</p>
      <p>Season four will instead premiere in the UK on November 20, 2019 with Channel 4’s director of programmes, Ian Katz saying: “When we announced we would be airing <i>Rick and Morty</i> Series 4 on free to air TV in January we thought fans would be delighted.</p>
      <p>“Instead they told us – in their droves – that it wasn’t nearly soon enough, so we’ve listened and brought forward the UK premiere to November 20th on E4 and All 4. Enjoy!”</p>
