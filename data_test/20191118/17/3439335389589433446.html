      <p>FRESNO, Calif. &gt;&gt; Ten people were shot and four of them were killed today at a party in Fresno when suspects sneaked into a backyard filled with people and fired into the crowd, police said.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place about 6 p.m. on the city’s southeast side where people were gathered to watch a football game, Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley said.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Michael Reid told the Fresno Bee and the KSEE/KGPE TV stations that a total of 10 people were shot, with three found dead in the backyard. A fourth victim died at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Six others are expected to survive and are recovering at the hospital, police said. All the victims were Asian men ranging from ages 25 to 35, Reid said.</p>
      <p>“What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard,” Dooley said. “Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.”</p>
      <p>The victims were taken to Community Regional Medical Center in critical condition, and some are in critical but stable condition, the TV stations reported.</p>
      <p>About 35 people were at the party when the shooting began, Reid said.</p>
      <p>“Thank God that no kids were hurt,” he said.</p>
      <p>No suspect is in custody. Police said there was no immediate indication that the victims knew the shooter or shooters.</p>
      <p>Police were going door-to-door in search of surveillance video that might help them track down the suspects. The shooting took place about a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) from the city’s airport.</p>
      <p>Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in San Francisco were responding to the shooting, the Bee reported.</p>
      <p>It was at least the second fatal gun attack today in southeast Fresno, the Bee reported. A man in his 20s was shot to death early today at a home in another part of the city. Police have not said whether the incidents could be connected</p>
