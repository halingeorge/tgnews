      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:16:14+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ravichandran-ashwin/">Ravichandran Ashwin</a> is a man of many talents. The 33-year-old proved it yet again when he experimented with his bowling style during a practice session under the lights at the Holkat International Stadium in Indore — by switching his bowling hand.</p>
      <p>After the emphatic victory in the first Test against Bangladesh on Saturday, the Indian cricket team decided to stay back and practice with the pink balls ahead of the historic first-ever day-night Test in Kolkata on November 22.</p>
      <p>During such a practice session, the 33-year-old off-spinner was recently seen bowling leg-spin and during the practice with the pink ball.</p>
      <p>But this time he went a step further to bowl left-handed (mimicking Sri Lanka’s Sanath Jayasuriya) with the pink ball, and even got some turn and bounce.</p>

      <p>Ashwin tweeted a video of his after he noticed that netizens had made a video from the session quite viral because of the ace spinner’s similarity in action with Sri Lanka’s Sanath Jayasuriya.</p>
      <p>The former Sri Lankan all-rounder Sanath Jayasuriya had once dismantled India’s batting order with his part-time left-arm spin in the semi-finals of the 1996 World Cup, which was played in the Eden Gardens. It turns out that Ashwin was imitating his action with some light-hearted experimentation.</p>

      <p>Although an opening batsman, Jayasuriya ended up picking 323 wickets in ODIs in his career, which is the fourth-highest among Sri Lankan bowlers after frontline bowlers like Muttiah Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ashwin has recently joined Anil Kumble and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/harbhajan-singh/">Harbhajan Singh</a> by becoming only the third Indian bowler to pick up 250 Test wickets on home soil.</p>
      <p>Apart from the experienced spinner, Cheteshwar Pujara, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ravindra-jadeja/">Ravindra Jadeja</a>, Rishabh Pant, Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, and Kuldeep Yadav had also trained from the main team. Besides <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rohit-sharma/">Rohit Sharma</a>, the trio of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mohammed-shami/">Mohammed Shami</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a> were also given a break along with first Test double centurion Mayank Agarwal and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha.</p>
