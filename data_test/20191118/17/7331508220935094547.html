      <p>NEW YORK -- Derek Jeter is among 18 newcomers on the 2020 Hall of Fame ballot. He is likely to be an overwhelming choice to join former <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees">New York Yankees</a> teammate Mariano Rivera in Cooperstown after the reliever last year became the first unanimous pick by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.</p>
      <p>A 14-time All-Star shortstop and five-time World Series champion, Jeter hit .310 with 3,465 hits in 20 seasons and was the 1996 AL Rookie of the Year. He has been CEO of the <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins">Miami Marlins</a> the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>Other newcomers announced Monday by the BBWAA include Cliff Lee, Josh Beckett, Jason Giambi, Paul Konerko, Rafael Furcal, Bobby Abreu and Alfonso Soriano.</p>
      <p>Holdovers include Curt Schilling, who received 60.9% last year, Roger Clemens (59.5%), Barry Bonds (59.1%) and Larry Walker (54.6%). Schilling rose from 51.2% in 2018. Walker, on the ballot for the 10th and final time this year, increased from 34.1% in 2018.</p>
      <p>Bonds and Clemens, whose candidacies have been tainted by allegations of steroid use, are both on for the eighth time. Clemens rose from 57.3% in 2018 and Bonds from 56.4%.</p>
      <p>Ballots are sent to more than 400 BBWAA members with at least 10 consecutive years in the organization, and a player must appear on at least 75% to gain election. Ballots must be mailed by Dec. 31, and results will be announced Jan. 21.</p>
      <p>Anyone elected will be inducted July 26 along with any selections by the Hall's modern era committee, which meets and votes in San Diego on Dec. 8.</p>
      <p>Players remain on the ballot for up to 10 years, provided they receive at least 5% of the vote annually.</p>
      <p>Roy Halladay, Edgar Martinez and Mike Mussina were elected along with Rivera in the 2019 BBWAA vote.</p>
