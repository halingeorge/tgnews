      <p>Dramatic video has been released showing the moment Jodie Chesney’s killers were caught.</p>
      <p>Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, burnt his clothes and disposed of the knife he used to stab the 17-year-old Girl Scout immediately after the attack.</p>
      <p>He had been lying low at the home of 17-year-old Arron Isaacs’ uncle in Dagenham, east London, when police swooped to arrest them both on the evening of March 10.</p>
      <p>When police arrived, they heard a commotion outside and an officer shouted: “Around the back.”</p>
      <p>In police body-worn video, Ong-a-Kwie can be seen clambering over a rear flat roof and crashing into the conservatory below.</p>
      <p>An officer shouted: “Stay where you are. Show me your hands now. Get over here now.”</p>
      <p>As he was handcuffed, an officer confirmed to colleagues that he was “detained”.</p>
      <p>When told he was arrested on suspicion of murder, Ong-a-Kwie said: “What? Murder? I killed no-one.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Isaacs had escaped through a window but was apprehended in the back garden with a rucksack containing a deadly Rambo-style knife.</p>
      <p>He was initially arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender but later also charged with Jodie’s murder.</p>
      <p>The footage was released by the Metropolitan Police as Ong-a-Kwie was jailed for at least 26 years and Isaacs was locked up for at least 18 years for their part in Jodie’s death on March 1.</p>
