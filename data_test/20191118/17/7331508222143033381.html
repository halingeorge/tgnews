      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/150/duke-blue-devils">Duke</a> is back at No. 1, moving up a spot after a pair of victories last week.</p>
      <p>The Blue Devils can thank <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/339/evansville-purple-aces">Evansville</a> for the jump.</p>
      <p>Duke moved to No. 1 for the first time this season, receiving 52 first-place votes from a 65-member media panel in The Associated Press men's college basketball poll released Monday.</p>
      <p>The Blue Devils climbed a spot after unranked Evansville pulled off the 2019-20 season's biggest surprise so far by knocking off previous No. 1 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/96/kentucky-wildcats">Kentucky</a>.</p>
      <p>"Our sport is more prone to upset than any because there are just five people out there, so there's age, athleticism, maturity, depth and a lot of things where people can make up differences,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "That's why there are a lot of so-called upsets in our sport. A lot of people can win and you have to be ready to play all those people.''</p>

      <p>Duke (4-0) crushed <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2110/central-arkansas-bears">Central Arkansas</a> 105-54 last Tuesday and beat <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/photos/_/id/2247/georgia-state-panthers">Georgia State</a> 74-63 Friday behind <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4395626/tre-jones">Tre Jones</a>' career-high 31 points.</p>
      <p>No. 2 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/97/louisville-cardinals">Louisville</a> received eight first-place votes and No. 3 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/127/michigan-state-spartans">Michigan State</a>, the preseason No. 1, had four. <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2305/kansas-jayhawks">Kansas</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/153/north-carolina-tar-heels">North Carolina</a> rounded out the top five, with No. 7 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/258/virginia-cavaliers">Virginia</a> receiving the final first-place vote, one spot behind <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/120/maryland-terrapins">Maryland</a>.</p>
      <p>Kentucky was the overwhelming pick at No. 1 last week, receiving all but one first-place vote after knocking off previous No. 1 Michigan State in its opener.</p>
      <p>The Wildcats dropped to No. 9 this week with the 67-64 loss to Evansville in Lexington.</p>
      <p>"This was a great lesson for all of us, including me,'' Kentucky coach John Calipari said. "I mean, we could say they got outplayed, and I could tell you I got outcoached.''</p>
      <p>TOP-10 SHUFFLE</p>
      <p>Kentucky's loss caused a shift in the top 10.</p>
      <p>Every team behind the Wildcats moved up a spot except for <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2250/gonzaga-bulldogs">Gonzaga</a>, which held at No. 8.</p>
      <p>No. 10 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes">Ohio State</a> cracked the top 10 for the first time since reaching No. 8 in 2017-18, coach Chris Holtmann's first season. The Buckeyes climbed six spots after crushing then-No. 10 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/222/villanova-wildcats">Villanova</a>.</p>
      <p>RISING</p>
      <p>Ohio State had the biggest jump in this week's poll, followed by No. 14 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/12/arizona-wildcats">Arizona</a>'s five-spot climb.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2/auburn-tigers">Auburn</a> moved up three places from No. 22.</p>
      <p>FALLING</p>
      <p>Kentucky's eight-place fall was the biggest of the week. Villanova was next, losing seven spots to No. 17, and No. 25 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/264/washington-huskies">Washington</a> fell five places.</p>
      <p>MOVING IN</p>
      <p>Three teams moved into the AP Top 25 this week.</p>
      <p>No. 20 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2633/tennessee-volunteers">Tennessee</a> is ranked for the first time this season after knocking off Washington.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/schedule/_/id/2670">No. 21 Virginia Commonwealth,</a> the preseason No. 25, is back in the poll after a two-point win over LSU and a rout of <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/55/jacksonville-state-gamecocks">Jacksonville State</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/251/texas-longhorns">Texas</a> moved in at No. 22 with wins over California Baptist and Prairie View. The Longhorns are ranked for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>MOVING OUT</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/57/florida-gators">Florida</a> had a precipitous drop after losing to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/41/uconn-huskies">Connecticut</a>, falling out of the poll from No. 15.</p>
      <p>LSU was out from No. 23 following its loss to VCU and <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2608/saint-mary's-gaels">Saint Mary's</a> dropped out from No. 18 after losing to Winthrop at home.</p>
