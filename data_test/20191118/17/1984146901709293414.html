      <h1>Phil Parkinson considering promoting from within as John Potter leaves Wearside</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland coach John Potter is heading to Hibernian to link up with Jack Ross again, leaving Phil Parkinson with a vacancy to fill</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Phil Parkinson will look to bring in a new first team coach as John Potter heads to Hibernian for a reunion with Jack Ross.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross'</a> assistant James Fowler departing when Parkinson took charge a month ago, and with goalkeeping coach Craig Samson leaving Wearside at the beginning of November to be replaced by Lee Butler, Potter was the only remaining member of the backroom team Ross brought to the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <p>And with Ross installed on Friday as the new boss at Hibs, the Easter Road club immediately got in touch with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> to bring Potter on board.</p>
      <p>Parkinson confirmed today: "There has been contact between the two clubs.</p>
      <p>"The possibility is that the lure of going back home to Scotland will be one that John will take and if he does we'll wish him all the best."</p>
      <p>And Chroniclelive understands a deal has now been concluded for the 39-year-old, whose family is still based in Scotland, which leaves <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> needing to fill a vacancy.</p>

      <p>Parkinson has already brought in the three-strong backroom staff - assistant Steve Parkin, Butler, and physical performance coach Nick Allamby - that he has worked with at previous clubs, but he has not tended to work with any particular first-team coach.</p>
      <p>However he says he has 'people in mind' - and has not ruled out promoting from within at the Academy of Light, which would hold the advantage of appointing a coach who already knows the players.</p>
      <p>He said: "We have had discussions [about a new coach] because over the last week or so Jack [Ross] had been rumoured to be going to one of the Edinburgh clubs.</p>
      <p>"We'll see what happens with John over the next 24 hours, then I'll sit down with the owner and see what we are going to do.</p>
      <p>"We've got people in mind, but it might also be someone from within.</p>
      <p>"That's between me, Steve [Parkin], and [head of football operations] Richard Hill, and we will have a good chat about that when the time is right."</p>
      <p>Fowler was today appointed head of football operations at Kilmarnock.</p>
