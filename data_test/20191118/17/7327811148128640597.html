      <p>LAS VEGAS -- After 11 years, Donny and Marie Osmond's Las Vegas residency came to an end over the weekend with a sold-out crowd and a standing ovation.</p>
      <p>The musical duo's stay at the Flamingo hotel on the Strip initially began as a six-week engagement. But, it quickly gained steam and was so well received that it was extended again and again for years.</p>
      <p>As the curtain fell for the final time, the siblings tearfully embraced as they were sent off in style by a crowd of thousands.</p>
