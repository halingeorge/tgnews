      <h1>Both Manchester United and City said to be set to offer €50m for Leicester City player</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/">Turkish newspaper Fanatik</a> claim Manchester United and Manchester City are interested in signing Leicester City’s defender Caglar Soyuncu ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The 23 year old, who has been in an excellent form for his club and country this season, has reportedly caught the eye of the two Premier League giants and Fanatik claim both Manchester clubs are preparing bids for the player.</p>
      <p>According to the Turkish newspaper, Manchester United and Manchester City will offer €50m to Leicester to sign the former Altinordu defender, as they look to strengthen their defences in the new year.</p>
      <p>Fellow Premier League side Arsenal have also been linked with the player in recent weeks.</p>

      <p>Soyuncu has helped Turkey to qualify for Euro 2020 with his impressive displays but he’s surely unlikely to leave Leicester at this stage of the season.</p>
      <p>The young defender has made 13 appearances for the Foxes this campaign and is under contract at the King Power Stadium until June 2023.</p>
      <p>Even next summer it’s got to be unlikely that €50m would be an acceptable figure, and there’s a possibility this is just the Turkish media hyping up their latest star.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola lost out to United on Harry Maguire during the summer, so, if the interest is correct, perhaps it’s Manchester City who are likelier to make a move.</p>
