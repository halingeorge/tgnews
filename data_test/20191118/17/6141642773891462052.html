      <p>The first televised debate of the General Election campaign will take place on Tuesday evening between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats and the SNP have lost a High Court challenge against ITV over its decision to exclude their party leaders from Tuesday’s first television debate, and will therefore not take part.</p>
      <p>The two parties had taken ITV to court, saying their exclusion deprived voters of the chance to make their own decisions.</p>
      <p>The broadcasters have announced a series of debates, including two head-to-heads after reaching an agreement between the Tories and Labour, one three-way debate and one seven-way debate.</p>

        <b>Planned debates</b>
      </p>
      <p>A head-to-head debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn will be aired on ITV on Tuesday at 8pm.</p>
      <p>Sky will host a three-way debate including Mr Johnson, Mr Corbyn and Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson on November 28.</p>
      <p>The next day, the BBC will host a seven-way debate in Cardiff on November 29, between leaders or senior figures from the seven major GB political parties.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster will then host a “prime ministerial debate” on December 6 from Southampton between Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p>
        <b>First debates</b>
      </p>
      <p>Televised general election debates started in 2010, with Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg clashing in three debates.</p>
      <p>Some analysts concluded the first debate resulted in a so-called “Cleggmania”, with an immediate poll bounce for the Lib Dems, who briefly polled ahead of Labour and the Tories.</p>
      <p>This was not reflected in the eventual election result, with the party finishing third and 13 points behind the Tories.</p>

      <p>The debates in the three-weeks before polling day garnered 9.7 million (April 15 – ITV), 2.2 million (April 22 – Sky) and 7.4 million (April 29 – BBC) viewers respectively.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2015 debates</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2015, after much wrangling in the months beforehand, one seven-way debate took place on ITV between Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Ukip, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru.</p>
      <p>A “challenger debate” between opposition parties was also aired on the BBC without the Tories or Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>The seven-way debate attracted 7.3 million viewers for ITV on April 2 and the “opposition debate” attracted 4.4 million for the BBC on April 16.</p>

        <b>2017 debates</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2017, Jeremy Corbyn and then-PM Theresa May were both invited to a seven-way leaders’ debate on ITV, but both declined the invitation, with a five-way debate taking place instead.</p>
      <p>Later, Mrs May refused to take part in a seven-way debate on the BBC, sending then-home secretary Amber Rudd instead, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn deciding to take part at the last minute.</p>
      <p>This debate on May 31 attracted just 3.6 million viewers for the BBC.</p>
