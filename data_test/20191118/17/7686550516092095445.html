      <h1>Wales suffer fresh injury blow with Tomas Francis set to miss the Six Nations</h1>
      <h2>The Wales star suffered a nasty shoulder injury in the Rugby World Cup semi-final loss to South Africa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:39:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Thomas</a></address>
      <p>New <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/wales-rugby-team">Wales</a> coach Wayne Pivac has received more bad news with <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/tomas-francis">Tomas Francis</a> the latest star name to be ruled out of the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/six-nations">Six Nations.</a></p>
      <p>Exeter tighthead Francis will be sidelined for up to four months due to surgery on the shoulder he damaged during the World Cup semi-final defeat to South Africa in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>He was hurt while attempting to tackle Springboks No 8 Duane Vermeulen, taking a heavy blow to his right shoulder which forced him to leave the field.</p>
      <p>Now the full extent of the injury has been revealed by the Chiefs, with the 48-cap front rower having to go under the knife.</p>
      <p>Director of rugby, Rob Baxter, said: “After two or three scans it became clear that Tom needs an operation to repair the shoulder injury he picked up with Wales at the World Cup.</p>

      <p>“It’s not great news for us, but at least we know where we stand now.”</p>
      <p>This means the 27-year-old Francis will be out until late March, effectively ruling him out of any involvement in the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>He joins Jonathan Davies (knee), Rhys Patchell (shoulder) and Gareth Anscombe (knee) in that crocked category.</p>
      <p>It leaves Pivac with a squad vacancy to fill in the tight-head department as he looks ahead to the Championship.</p>
      <p>Dillon Lewis, of Cardiff Blues, will now be the favourite to wear the No 3 jersey, having had a fine World Cup.</p>
      <p>He played in all seven matches out in Japan and showed up well, both in the loose and with his improving scrummaging.</p>

      <p>Lewis, 23, is likely to start against the Barbarians at the end of this month and would be the frontrunner for that role in the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>As for other tight-head options, the 41-cap Samson Lee provides plenty of experience, while the Dragons’ Leon Brown is a developing talent.</p>
      <p>Pivac could also look at the uncapped WillGriff John, who has been a consistent performer for Sale over the past couple of years.</p>
      <p>The former Cardiff Blues and Doncaster prop, who also had a spell playing out in New Zealand, is a real physical presence at 6ft 3ins and 20st 7lbs.</p>
