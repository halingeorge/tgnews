      <p>A Muslim family have spoken of how they feel ‘sick and violated’ after being delivered a pork sausage pizza instead of the vegetarian one they had ordered.</p>
      <p>Exeter family-of-five the Khans ordered a vegetarian supreme online from Domino's in Honiton Road last night.</p>
      <p>The mistake only came to light when they began tucking into their takeaway after it had been delivered.</p>
      <p>Dad Sami Khan had already eaten a slice of when he saw that the ‘funny taste’ was in fact pork which is against their religion to eat.</p>
      <p>Domino's have apologised for the error, but the family say it is not good enough.</p>
      <p>In 2017, a Muslim man suing America’s third largest pizza chain - Little Caesars - for $100 million (£78 million) after being served a pizza labelled halal which was topped with pork pepperoni.    </p>

      <p>Ambia said: “My husband ate one slice and he wasn’t sure, so he looked on another slice of pizza and saw the pork.</p>
      <p>“He feels sick and violated as it’s pork sausage and we’re Muslim.</p>
      <p>“Pork is an absolute no, and on top of that we are vegetarian.</p>
      <p>“Domino's have dealt with this situation horrendously. They said we could have a replacement pizza, but we didn’t want anything from them.</p>
      <p>“When my husband took the pizza to them in Honiton Road they confirmed it was sausage. No one came to our house to collect the pizza for investigation. In the shop they apologised but said, ‘it’s busy shop, it happens, just deal with it’.</p>
      <p>“They offered replacement but after experiencing this we don’t want anything from them. What about if we were allergic? They can’t say sorry if that person happened to die.</p>
      <p>“We have not had a refund, but that's not the point. This is morally and ethically wrong.</p>
      <p>“If it can happen to us it can happen again. They need to do something to ensure there is no risk of cross contamination. It is serious and for an established business like Domino's it should be priority.”</p>
      <p>A Domino’s spokesperson said: "This was an innocent mistake.</p>
      <p>"When the customer notified us we immediately apologised and collected the pizza to investigate further.</p>
      <p>"We issued a full refund to the customer and offered to remake and deliver a fresh order.”</p>
