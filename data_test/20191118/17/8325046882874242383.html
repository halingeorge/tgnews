      <p>Before you can move your private files or photos to the Secure Folder, you need to set it up.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Start the Settings app.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Tap “Biometrics and security.”</p>

      <p><b>3.</b> Tap “Secure Folder.”</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> If this is your first time using the Secure Folder, you need to tap “Agree” on the welcome page.</p>
      <p><b>5.</b> Log into your Google account if requested, and then wait while the Secure Folder is set up.</p>
      <p><b>6.</b> On the Secure Folder lock type page, choose how you want to secure the folder. Choose “Pattern,” “PIN,” or “Password.” You can also enable the fingerprint reader by swiping the button to the right. The fingerprint reader is only a secondary form of security, so you still need to pick one of the other three. Then tap “Next.”</p>
