      <p>The House of Representatives is examining whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/house-investigating-trump-lying-to-mueller/index.html">CNN reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Douglas Letter, the House's general counsel, on Monday cited questions over whether Trump lied to Mueller in explaining to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit why the House needs grand jury material from the special counsel probe, asking, "Did the President lie? Was the President not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?"</p>
      <p>Previously, House lawyers while seeking grand jury information had said the materials "could reveal that Trump was aware of his campaign's contacts with WikiLeaks," <i><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/30/trump-mueller-house-democrats-lie-1520156">Politico </a></i><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/30/trump-mueller-house-democrats-lie-1520156">reported</a>. In the recent trial of former Trump adviser Roger Stone, former Trump campaign official Rick Gates <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/12/20961397/roger-stone-trial-rick-gates-trump-wikileaks">testified</a> that Trump spoke with Stone over the phone in July, after WikiLeaks had started releasing hacked Democratic National Committee emails, and said after the call ended that "more information would be coming." In his written answers to Mueller, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/roger-stone-trial-evidence-reveals-fresh-detail-about-trump-campaigns-interest-in-wikileaks/2019/11/14/5b5c5d5c-0728-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html">said</a>, "I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with [Roger Stone], nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign."</p>

Trump attorney Jay Sekulow <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-investigating-whether-trump-lied-to-robert-mueller-in-russia-investigation">told <i>The Daily Beast</i></a><i> </i>following Monday's news, "Read the answers to [the] questions.
