      <p>Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami will formally inaugurate Tenkasi district, which was recently bifurcated from Tirunelveli district, on November 22.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister, who is expected to reach Thoothukudi on Thursday evening and drive down to Tenkasi on the next morning, will preside over the 90-minute-long function and distribute welfare measures to beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>He is likely to lay the foundation for an integrated collectorate complex, housing the district police office, which is expected to come up on a 50-acre government land at Aayiraperi.</p>
      <p>Inspector General of Police, South Zone, K.P. Shanmugarajeswaran, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tirunelveli Range, Praveen Kumar Abinapu, Superintendents of Police Om Prakash Meena (Tirunelveli) and G. Suguna Singh (Tenkasi) and other senior police officials on Monday held discussions on security arrangements for the Chief Ministerâ€™s visit.</p>
      <p>Although a formal puja was performed on Government Higher Secondary School ground near Tenkasi new bus stand on Monday for erection of pandal for the event, the venue is likely to be shifted to a school premises near Azad Nagar bridge, where Mr. Palaniswami attended a function where former Minister Esakki Subiah was readmitted into the AIADMK from the T.T.V. Dhinakaran-led Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam.</p>
