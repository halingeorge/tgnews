      <h1>Oculus Link for PC is live: Everything we know about cables, GPU support [Updated]</h1>
      <h2>Beta for this wired-VR update is now live; official Oculus Link cable coming soon.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:00:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Machkovech</a></address>
      <p>Oculus Quest owners, your chance to dive into the world of PC-VR gaming has begun.</p>
      <p>The Oculus Home app on Windows PCs has just been updated to support the standalone Oculus Quest, two months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/oculus-quests-secret-trick-it-can-double-as-a-wired-pc-vr-headset/">the "Oculus Link" feature was teased and demonstrated at the most recent Oculus Connect conference</a>.</p>
      <p>(If you're unfamiliar with the slightly confusing Oculus ecosystem of virtual reality, the above sentences are likely a bit confusing. If so, head <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/oculus-quest-review-2019s-best-new-gaming-system-is-wireless-affordable-vr/">here</a> for a refresher on what the Oculus Quest headset is, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/oculus-quests-secret-trick-it-can-double-as-a-wired-pc-vr-headset/">here</a> for an explanation of why this new Oculus Link update is a big deal.)</p>
      <p>With Oculus Link enabled, the standalone Quest can now connect, via USB Type-C 3 cable, to a PC of your choosing and access the higher-powered VR library on PC storefronts like Oculus Home. We'll return after testing to confirm whether SteamVR also works properly via Oculus Link.</p>
      <h3>AMD, for now, is DOA</h3>
      <p>In the meantime, Oculus has confirmed a jump in required PC specs for Oculus Link use, which we knew might be coming due to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/the-future-of-oculus-quest-hands-on-with-hand-tracking-pc-vr-link-mode/">Link's additional rendering pipeline demands</a>. AMD-graphics-card owners get some lousy news today: your systems will <i>not</i> work with Oculus Link at launch. Higher-end AMD cards will eventually be supported, Oculus reps tell Ars, while weaker Nvidia cards like the GTX 970 and the notebook variant of the GTX 1060 are not currently supported.</p>
      <p>That change in rendering pipeline also means PC-VR games, as rendered by a wired Quest, will look blurrier than on native PC headsets. Our tests at the last Oculus Connect event revealed tolerable VR performance on Quest via Link, but I called the results "a killer perk, not a PC headset replacement." Link's apparent downgrades to resolution and frame rate were significant enough at the time to reassure any owners of new kits like the Oculus Rift S to not regret their purchases.</p>

      <p>We're still waiting for a release date for the official Oculus Link Headset Cable beyond "2019." When it launches, this $79 fiber-optic cable will offer a significant length for the sake of real-world movement—five meters, roughly the same as most wired VR kits—and a crucial right-angle connector to prevent awkward cord dangling. The Quest's USB Type-C port is placed high on one side, which isn't ideal for a jutting cord to be connected at all times; as a result, I strongly warned against plugging Quest hardware into a wall plug during standard play.</p>
      <p>But you'll need to settle on standard cords at this point in the Quest Link beta period, and Oculus recommends a "high-quality" USB 3.0 cable. This brings up a huge catch: the USB Type-C cable that comes with every Oculus Quest system is actually rated for the USB 2.0 spec, so it won't work. If you're eager to dive into Oculus Link today, look out for a Type-C cable rated for either USB 3.1 or USB 3.2 speeds. (Oculus is currently recommending that members of the press try out <a href="https://amzn.to/2QvwXGk">this 10-foot cable from Anker</a>.)</p>
      <p>Oculus made clear during September's conference that the Quest headset's few months of existence had driven significant software sales: $20 million of software in four months, versus $80 million of Oculus Rift software sales in over three years. Hence, it makes sense that Oculus is bullish on unlocking further software sales opportunities via today's new Link feature.</p>

      <p>This holiday season includes two huge game launches for the Rift PC platform: <a href="https://www.oculus.com/stormland/?locale=en_US"><i>Stormland</i></a>, a guns-and-flight action-adventure, and <a href="https://www.oculus.com/asgards-wrath/?locale=en_US"><i>Asgard's Wrath</i></a>, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/skyrim/"><i>Skyrim</i></a>-like fantasy RPG. We'll have more on both of those large games by year's end, along with advice on whether either scales well to the inherent limits of Oculus Link's visual downgrades on Quest headsets.</p>
      <h3>Time for some Link action</h3>
      <p><b>Update, November 19</b>: Oculus's rollout of the feature appears to have come in waves, as I had to wait an additional day after the rollout to access Oculus Link. I'm currently on vacation, so this is a quick update to simply confirm: it works, and it fully supports SteamVR.</p>
      <p>To access a Steam library on Oculus Quest via Oculus Link, you'll need to find your computer's desktop (which Oculus Home lets you do with an easy-to-find "virtual desktop" button), then click through to your Steam library and load SteamVR from there. But it works, and it treats a connected Oculus Quest as if it were a standard PC headset—and neatly translates the Oculus Touch controllers, to boot.</p>
      <p>My incredibly brief testing revolved around booting into SteamVR and then jumping into that store's installs of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2018/5/"><i>Beat Saber</i></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/pistol-whip-review-the-years-freshest-vr-game-and-oh-so-close-to-greatness/"><i>Pistol Whip</i></a> to test image quality and latency. Quite honestly, I'm a bit more impressed in this first-blush moment than I was when I tested Oculus Link at a conference in September. I could absolutely notice a smidge of extra latency in my <i>Beat Saber</i> sword swipes, and it was arguably better than any such tolerable lag that I've noticed in modern wireless-VR setups. And while Quest's 72Hz refresh has nothing on the 120Hz standard of Valve Index, there's something to be said about my powerful PC rendering a fuller image that's then neatly and cleanly downscaled to the Quest's sharp, high-res OLED.</p>
      <p>If you own a Quest, you really should run, not walk, to buy a compatible USB 3 Type-A-to-Type-C cable to try this out. It's a heckuva Quest party trick.</p>
