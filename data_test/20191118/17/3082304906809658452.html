      <h1>Gareth Bale: Euphoria of Euro 2016 can inspire Wales against Hungary</h1>

        <b>Wales can use the experience of reaching the semi-finals three years ago to help them qualify for Euro 2020, says Gareth Bale.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gareth Bale believes the euphoric feeling of Wales’ run to the semi-finals at Euro 2016 will spur Ryan Giggs’ side on against Hungary.</p>
      <p>Following a 2-0 victory over Azerbaijan on Saturday, Wales head into their final qualifying match knowing a win will be enough to secure a place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Bale scored three goals at the previous finals as Wales – with Chris Coleman in charge – reached the last four in France, going out to eventual champions Portugal.</p>
      <p>The Real Madrid forward has claimed Wales can use the experiences gained from three years ago, plus their failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, as inspiration heading into Tuesday’s crucial clash in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>“I think we can use both of [the experiences] to our advantage,” Bale told a news conference.</p>
      <p>“We have got the kind of euphoria of qualifying for our first Euros and doing so well at the competition that we really want to do that again.</p>
      <p>“We’ve also got the negatives of knowing how it feels to miss out on qualifying for a tournament like we did with the World Cup.</p>
      <p>“We can see how we don’t want to feel after the game. We know prior to this game we can push and push not to feel like that again, because it’s not a feeling you want in the dressing room after the game.</p>

      <p>“The experience of qualifying for the Euros was massive and something I’ve never done before and to do it again might be a bit more impressive.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to stand in equal stead as last time, but we can’t think about that just yet. We have another important match first and we have to focus on that as a team and a squad.”</p>
      <p>Giggs confirmed on Monday that Bale and Aaron Ramsey, who has been hampered by a thigh problem, are both ready to start against Hungary.</p>
      <p>“I’m ready. I hadn’t played in four weeks so it was important to get 60 minutes into my legs and get some match sharpness,” Bale added.</p>
      <p>“We spoke at the start of the week about trying to get 60 minutes and hopefully being a couple [of goals] up before I came off, so it worked out well, no problems, and I’m ready to go for Tuesday.”</p>
