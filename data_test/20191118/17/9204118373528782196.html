      <p>Baker Hughes (Houston; <a href="http://www.bakerhughes.com/">www.bakerhughes.com</a>) broke ground on its first chemicals manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, designed to help customers improve production, reduce costs, and maximize the value of their assets across the chemicals value chain.</p>
      <p>The company held a ground-breaking ceremony at the facility’s PlasChem Park location in Jubail to celebrate the milestone and formalize an agreement with Sadara Chemical Company to supply the facility with feedstock chemicals.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to begin building our chemicals manufacturing facility to meet the growing needs of customers in Saudi Arabia and across the Middle East,” said Jerome Jammal, Baker Hughes vice president, Oilfield and Industrial Chemicals. “For more than a century, we have invented many of the chemicals that have taken energy forward. Localizing these capabilities will drive the continued development of our business and workforce in full alignment with Saudi Aramco’s In-Kingdom Total Value Add (IKTVA) program.”</p>
      <p>The manufacturing facility will deliver the company’s full portfolio of chemical services and technology solutions for the hydrocarbon production, transmission, processing and petrochemical industries. Employees will also collaborate with researchers and subject matter experts at the Baker Hughes Dhahran Technology Center to address region-specific chemicals challenges and deliver value-added solutions to customers.</p>
