      <p>In Dharmapuri, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam staged a protest outside the main post office.</p>
      <p>According to the farmers’ organisation, the high voltage power lines entails acquisition of 40 metre to 60 metre wide farm land and also forbids a wide range of farm activities and cropping patters up to 33 metres from the towers. The power lines passing through 13 districts in the State has seen a string of protests over the past many months.</p>
      <p>The Sangam dubbed the Indian farmers as the scapegoat for all “so called development projects”. The protests cited the expressway project, the hydrocarbon project, Methane project, Gail gas line project, six-lane expansion projects and similar high voltage transmission lines of Tangedco among others “usurping the lands of the farmers.”</p>
      <p>According to the farmers’ association, such projects should be scrapped and the high tension power transmission lines should be directed underground and not over farmlands.</p>
