      <h1>Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon highest since 2008: official</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:40:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil surged to nearly 10,000 square kilometers in the year to July 2019 -- the highest in more than a decade, officials said Monday.</p>
      <p>The 29.5 percent increase from the previous 12-month period comes after fires ravaged swathes of the Amazon this year, igniting a global outcry and diplomatic feud between President Jair Bolsonaro and European leaders.</p>
      <p>Satellite data collected by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) show 9,762 square kilometers (3,770 square miles) were cleared of trees, INPE officials told AFP.</p>
      <p>That is the highest since the same period in 2008.</p>
      <p>Para was the hardest hit of the nine states that make up the Amazon in Brazil, with nearly 4,000 square kilometers deforested.</p>
      <p>Previous data showed clearing in the Amazon nearly doubled in the first eight months of this year, compared with the same period in 2018, to 6,404 square kilometers.</p>
      <p>Greenpeace blamed the dismantling of environmental protections under Bolsonaro for the sharp increase in deforestation.</p>
      <p>Bolsonaro's "government is throwing away all the work that has been done in recent decades for environmental protection," said Cristiane Mazzetti, a Greenpeace campaigner in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Pro-business Bolsonaro took power in January on a promise to open up more of the Amazon to loggers, miners and farmers.</p>
      <p>Faced with criticism over the fires and tree clearing, Bolsonaro accused non-government organizations of starting the blazes, and France and others of threatening Brazil's sovereignty over the rainforest.</p>
