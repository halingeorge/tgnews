        <b>JACK ROSS wants to build a Hibs team that the fans can be proud of again.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new Easter Road boss was officially unveiled as new <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/">Hibees</a> gaffer today and he is targeting being at the club for many years to come.</p>

      <p>The 43-year-old has signed a three-and-a-half year-deal at the Leith club and he's hoping to deliver success to the green half of Edinburgh in that time.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sky Sports, Ross said: "Part of the attraction for me in the early discussions we had was the want for me to be here for a number of years.</p>
      <p>"I’m not here to use it as a stepping stone or a platform, I want to be a successful Hibs manager and I want to be here for the long term.</p>
      <p>"I suppose my other answer for that is I went to a club where there was a high frequency in changes of managers and I think I was the longest serving since Steve Bruce so I did okay in that respect.</p>

      <p>"I could have been there for longer but certainly the ambition here is to be here for a long period of time.</p>
      <p>"You have to win football matches as a manager and as a club. Supporters want that but equally there are demands at certain clubs as well for how you do it.</p>
      <p>"It's not like I'm not familiar with this club I have been here often enough as an opposition player, coach and manager.</p>
      <p>"I've seen some really good sides so it's up to me to make sure I can provide a side that can satisfy the demands of the supporters as well."</p>
      <p>Ross replaced the axed Paul Heckingbottom at Hibs, but he did have offers from other clubs.</p>
      <p>He could have made the choice to be based across the city when Hearts came calling.</p>
      <p>Ross added: "From the initial conversations with Leeann (Dempster), Graeme (Mathie) and Ron (Gordon), I got a good feel from them and I think that's important.</p>
      <p>"We then progressed to the more formal discussions in terms of what I could offer the club.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of good things in place at this club whether it be the training ground or stadium.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of good things behind the scenes that people don't see but are very good and very positive but I feel it is a good fit.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately the proof will be in the pudding in terms of what I can produce on the pitch but it felt very natural from very early on."</p>
