      <h1>More than 100,000 children in migration-related US detention: UN</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:20:25+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>More than 100,000 children are currently being held in migration-related detention in the United States, including those held with their parents and minors detained alone, the UN said Monday.</p>
      <p>"The total number currently detained is 103,000," said Manfred Nowak, lead author of the United Nations Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty.</p>
      <p>Nowak told AFP the figure was a "conservative" assessment, based on the latest available official data as well as "very reliable" additional sources.</p>
      <p>Globally, at least 330,000 children across 80 countries are being held for migration-related reasons, according to the global study that launched Monday, meaning the US accounts for nearly a third of such detentions.</p>
      <p>"Migration-related detention for children can never be considered... in the best interest of the child. There are always alternatives available," Nowak told reporters in Geneva.</p>
      <p>He explained that the 103,000 figure refers to children who arrived at a US border unaccompanied, as well as those detained with relatives and those separated from their parents prior to detention.</p>
