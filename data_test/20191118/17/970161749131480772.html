      <p>This is the shocking moment a teacher viciously beat a student and slammed her to the floor in a classroom.</p>
      <p>Vivian Noirie, 36, was arrested and charged with physical child abuse and second-degree assault after the ‘extraordinarily violent’ assault at Largo High <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> in Upper Marlboro, Maryland on Friday, police said.</p>
      <p>Investigators said that the student, who is not named because of her age, was upset and approached Noirie because she called her parents the previous night for unspecified reasons.</p>
      <p>Police said: ‘During that encounter, the student admits to stepping on the teacher’s foot and bumping into the teacher with her shoulder.’</p>
      <p>Video of the fight posted on social media shows Noirie punching and kicking the student from behind after the student bumped her.</p>

      <p>Chaos continued to erupt in the classroom as the student chased down Noirie, threw her over a desk, and began punching her. Another school worker then entered the class and pulled the girl off Noirie.</p>
      <p>The girl is heard shouting: ‘She hit me first…everybody saw that shit.’</p>
      <p>Noirie and the girl are heard trading threats from opposite sides of the room before the video ends.</p>
      <p>Monica Goldson, CEO of Prince George’s County Public Schools said in a statement: ‘I am extremely disappointed by the horrific actions that took place in our classroom today.’</p>
      <p>‘It’s important to know that we have set high expectations and standards for our staff and students, and what you saw on that video does not represent the hard work that over 10,000 teachers do every single day.’</p>
      <p>Neither Noirie or the student required medical attention, police said, adding that the student is faces charges in the juvenile court system.</p>
