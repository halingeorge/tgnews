        <b>The Civil Division of the High Court deputy head, observed that Bangirana does not have a valid contract of employment duly executed by an instrument yet he continuous to hold out as an AIGP.</b>

        <u>COURT</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>High Court in Kampala has ordered Senior Police officer Geoffrey Bangirana to vacate the office of the Director, Engineering, and Logistics in the Uganda Police Force.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“In the result, a temporal injunction shall issue restraining Bangirana from holding out as a serving Assistant Inspector General of Police and from acting as Director of Engineering and Logistics. The injunction order will remain in force until the determination of the main suit or until further orders of this court,” Justice Henrietta Wolayo ruled.</p>
      <p>The Civil Division of the High Court deputy head, observed that Bangirana does not have a valid contract of employment duly executed by an instrument yet he continuous to hold out as an AIGP.</p>
      <p>“The state of affairs waters down the authority of the office of AIGP and may bring the Police Force into disrepute thereby causing irreparable damage,” the judge noted.</p>
      <p>However, the judge declined to issue orders restraining the Police Authority from renewing the contract of the police boss.</p>
      <p>“Regarding the prayer for a temporal injunction to restrain the Uganda Police Authority from renewal of Bangirana’s contract, this prayer is without legal basis as the Police Authority cannot be constrained in the performance of its lawful duties,” she said.</p>
