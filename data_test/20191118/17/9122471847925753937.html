      <p>The Week 3 college basketball Associated Press top 25 poll has been released. We’ve got a new team at No. 1 overall.</p>
      <p>There’s been a shakeup at the top of the poll following Kentucky’s shocking home loss to Evansville. The Wildcats have fallen to the bottom of the top 10 as a result.</p>
      <p>Duke, meanwhile, has surged to the No. 1 spot. The Blue Devils are 4-0 on the season. Louisville, Michigan State, Kansas and North Carolina round out the top five.</p>
