      <h2>Lucas Digne is still targeting more personal improvement as his fantastic Everton form continues</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:30:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/adam-jones/" target="_blank">Adam Jones</a></address>
      <p>Lucas Digne has opened up on the areas he has improved in most during his time at Everton so far.</p>
      <p>The left back has already established himself as one of the club's most successful signings in recent years after completing a switch from Barcelona to Goodison park in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>The French international was fantastic throughout the following campaign and was named the Blues Player of the Season at The Dixies in May, while also scooping the Players' Player of the Seaon gong alongside Idrissa Gueye.</p>
      <p>After missing out on the World Cup winning side before joining <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> Digne's performances have now seen him regularly recalled to the France setup, but he is still targeting further improvement on a personal level.</p>
      <p>"At the club, the goals are simple, we must do better than last season. As an individual, it's the same principle," Digne told <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/albanie-france-je-suis-tres-fier-de-ma-carriere-confie-lucas-digne-16-11-2019-8194776.php">Le Parisien</a> .</p>
      <p>"I look at my statistics, the percentage of duels won, the number of successful crosses...I was elected player of the season at Everton, it makes me happy but these figures are more concrete. </p>
      <p>"I had to adapt quickly to the intensity, the physical impacts, playing fast forward and repeating the high-intensity efforts.</p>
      <p>"I am asked to be very offensive. But this involves defensively many duels in one against one because the matches are very open.</p>
      <p>"This is the championship that suits me best."</p>
      <p>Adapting to the Premier League from abroad is a difficult task for a lot of players, especially with a busy festive period on the horizon for clubs in England.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/lucas-digne">Digne</a> is prepared, and is enjoying the consistency of playing every week for Everton.</p>
      <p>He added: "I have more fun playing every weekend. The hardest thing is to stay constant at a very high level. This is what happens to the big players.</p>

      <p>"The key to this is to take care of yourself, to be vigilant about recovery, especially when playing two matches in 48 hours as in Boxing Day. This mainly involves food and sleep."</p>
      <p>Digne has been handed the captain's armband by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/marco-silva">Marco Silva</a> on a couple of occasions already this term, and he has reiterated the pride he feels when representing Everton in that manner.</p>
      <p>"There was a list of four captains. I was the fourth so I knew it could happen even if the probability was low," the defender added.</p>
      <p>"It is a pride to wear this armband. It's only been a season and a half I'm at the club, so it's a great sign of confidence.</p>
      <p>"Except in the France youth team, I had never worn the armband. It must be said that in Paris, Rome or Barcelona, ​​it would have been complicated!"</p>
