      <h1>Tottenham have been making enquiries for signing – Club looking at €20m for player</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.aksam.com.tr/">Aksam</a> claim Tottenham Hotspur are still showing an interest in Fenerbahce forward Vedat Muriqi and are making enquiries for the Kosovan international.</p>
      <p>The player has been linked with a move to Spurs in recent months following reports they’ve been scouting him during games for club and country.</p>
      <p>However, despite the interest from the Premier League side the Turkish newspaper say Fenerbahce don’t want to lose a key player halfway through the season, and are subsequently looking to keep him at least until the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The 25 year old has been impressive for Ersun Yanal’s side this season, scoring seven goals in eleven appearances for the Istanbul side. This had led to attention from clubs elsewhere in Europe, including Tottenham.</p>

      <p>Fenerbahce value their striker in the region of €20m and they could sell him next summer to fund incoming transfers.</p>
      <p>With Kosovo now in the playoffs to qualify for Euro 2020, the Turkish side are hoping Muriqi can help his country to the finals, which could then add significant value to his transfer fee.</p>
