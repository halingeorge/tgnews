      <h1>Half of all hawker stalls in Singapore now offer healthier choices, MOH says, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:10:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Lamont Mark Smith</a></address>
      <p>Eating out does not necessarily mean that you’re eating unhealthily, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH).</p>
      <p>As of last year, half of all stalls in hawker centres and coffee shops had at least one healthier option available on their menus, MOH revealed in a summary report of measures taken to fight diabetes between 2016 to 2019.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/publicfacing/createDataTable.action?refId=14624">Department of Statistics Singapore</a>, there were 6,090 hawkers in 2018 that were licensed to sell cooked food.</p>
      <p>Released on Sunday (Nov 17), the report also said that the number of healthier meals sold has increased, from 25 million meals in 2016 to 180 million in 2018.</p>
      <p>The proportion of Healthier Choice Symbol products has increased as well, by 7.4 per cent across 100 food categories.</p>
      <p>Other steps taken include a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.sg/singapore-is-banning-food-made-with-partially-hydrogenated-oil-heres-what-trans-fat-really-does-to-your-body/">ban on food containing partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs)</a> in June, as well as the world’s first <a href="https://www.businessinsider.sg/singapore-is-the-first-country-to-ban-advertisements-for-high-sugar-drinks-heres-what-will-happen/">ban on advertisements of packaged drinks</a> with very high sugar content.</p>
      <p>PHOs are a key source of trans-fat, which increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and type 2 diabetes, non-profit medical centre <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114">Mayo Clinic</a> says on its website.</p>
      <p>Nutrition labels will also be placed on drinks deemed “unhealthy” that have medium-to-high sugar content.</p>

        <b>Three broad issues in tackling diabetes: Minister </b>
      </p>
      <p>However, more issues need to be addressed.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a World Diabetes Day event on Sunday, Senior Minister of State for Law and Health Edwin Tong said that one in three Singaporeans are at risk of developing diabetes.</p>
      <p>The minister outlined three main issues in tackling the disease – patient empowerment, equipping healthcare professionals and the community better, and helping people maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Regarding patient empowerment, Tong said that there was not a one-size-fits-all solution, and that there was a need to curate customised programmes to help each diabetes patient.</p>
      <p>He cited a pilot programme by the National University Health System (NUHS) to motivate individuals to take ownership of their condition and make their own lifestyle changes as an example.</p>
      <p>Besides that, healthcare professionals and volunteers in the community “need access to more training and resources,” he said.</p>
      <p>In addition, Singapore has a high rate of diabetes-related foot and leg amputation, and screening is crucial for early detection.</p>
      <p>To aid this, a risk-stratified framework is being progressively rolled out by MOH across polyclinics and public hospitals, and will be extended to General Practitioners (GPs) in the future.</p>
      <p>The framework will look at foot screening, management and escalation to tertiary care at each stage, and will monitor specific conditions of each patient.</p>
      <p>As for equipping volunteers, Tong noted that there are initiatives such as NUHS’ Health Peers programme, where layperson volunteers  are trained by professionals to help people with diabetes.</p>
      <p>Through the programme, volunteers will understand the basic needs of diabetic patients and also know what to look out for, he added.</p>
      <p>The last area is to create an environment that helps people maintain healthy lifestyles, such as providing more information for consumers to make healthier choices.</p>
      <p>“We want to give you options, give you information and nudge consumers to take the healthier choice,” he added.</p>
      <p>As of 2017, 8.6 per cent of Singapore residents aged 18 to 69 had been diagnosed diabetes, according to the National Population Health Survey.</p>
