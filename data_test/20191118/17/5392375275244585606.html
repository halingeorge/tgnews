      <p>A few days ago, Motorola <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/the-foldable-motorola-razr-with-6-2-inch-oled-219-cinemavision-display-is-official/">resurrected its most-sold phone</a>, the RAZR. However, the new Motorola RAZR 2019 is considered to use a flip-type screen design. Thus, the new handset will be competing with other folding screen smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy Fold and the Huawei Mate X. This also means we are dealing with an expensive device, priced at $1499.99. And today, LetsGoDigital disclosed its European price. This handset will cost 1,680 euros.</p>
      <p>The phone has two screens. One of them is a 2.7-inch OLED screen with a resolution of 800 x 600. But when unfolded, the phone will offer another screen to operate with – a 6.2-inch pOLED display with a resolution of 2142 x 876 pixels.</p>

      <p>This smartphone can’t be considered as a top-end model when it comes to hardware. Under the hood, it carries a mid-range Snapdragon 710 chip. The SoC is accompanied by the 6GB of RAM and a 128GB of ROM. Moreover, the slim and folding body have affected the battery capacity – it is packed with a 2510mAh battery. The latter supports 15W charging. By the way, the phone uses a new battery design. Two battery units are placed on each side, ensuring the user’s trimming problem when the handset is unfolded.</p>
      <p>The new Motorola RAZR can’t boast of high-res camera sensors. A 16MP lens is placed outside, while a 5MP sensor is located inside.</p>
      <p>To ensure that the organic material covered by the screen does not have visible creases, the Moto RAZR offers a new floating hinge structure that stretches the flexible outer cover material to further counteract the crease problem.</p>
      <p>It will go on sale in January 2020.</p>
