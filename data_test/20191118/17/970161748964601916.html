      <p>Emmerdale is set to be rocked by some upsetting news on Monday after it’s revealed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/emmerdale-spoilers-maya-stepney-for-shock-return-after-prison-release-10971975/"> (Louisa Clein) has been released from prison.</a></p>
      <p>The teacher was at the centre of one of the soap’s most controversial storylines as she groomed and sexually abused <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (Joe Warren-Plant) for almost a year before finally getting her comeuppance.</p>
      <p>So with Jacob having finally started to move on from what happened, her release is naturally concerning to David (Matthew Wolfenden) and Leyla (Roxy Shahidi).</p>
      <p>Could Maya <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/22/is-maya-stepney-returning-to-emmerdale-what-happened-between-her-and-jacob-10615145/">be about to make a return to the Dales?</a> Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Is Maya returning to Emmerdale for good?</h3>
      <p>As it stands there are no current plans to bring the character back to Emmerdale.</p>

        <figcaption>Maya was eventually caught during a night out when she was seen kissing the teenager (Picture: ITV)</figcaption>

      <p>However it’s no surprise that David and Leyla are worried that Maya might attempt to contact Jacob now that she is a free woman.</p>

      <p>Monday night’s episode will see them deliberating over whether or not to tell the teenager about Maya’s release – and in the end decide that they should inform him.</p>
      <p>Jacob appears oddly composed about the news but later disappears – leaving the pair worried about whether he has gone to meet his abuser.</p>
      <p>And while there might currently be no plans for Maya to return to the Dales, that doesn’t mean she couldn’t make a return in the future.</p>
      <p>It’s a worrying time for sure.</p>
      <h3>What happened between Maya and Jacob?</h3>

      <p>Maya took advantage of Jacob after the pair of them met at school while he was in her class, grooming him and then starting a forbidden sexual relationship with him.</p>
      <p>The manipulative teacher continued things with Jacob for months before she was caught, with Leyla, Tracy Metcalfe (Amy Walsh) and Priya Kotecha (Fiona Wade) finding out what was going on during a night out clubbing.</p>
      <p>She was finally arrested and Jacob was called in for questioning, but when he had the chance to reveal the truth about what happened turned it down, meaning Maya was only charged for sexual text messages to Jacob found on his phone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/20/emmerdale-spoilers-exit-for-child-abuser-maya-stepney-as-she-is-jailed-10020036/">It meant that she only got a 12-month sentence in jail</a> – while Jacob, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/04/emmerdale-spoilers-sex-abuser-maya-stepney-returns-for-jacob-gallagher-9803555/">who was convinced he and Maya were in love,</a> has taken his frustrations out on David and Leyla.</p>
      <p>He even continued to write letters to her while she was behind bars – and would almost certainly be at risk once more if she were to return to Emmerdale.</p>
