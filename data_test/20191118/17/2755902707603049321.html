      <p>What started off as one happy lady showing off her dance moves in a video escalated into a violent and dramatic scene in the background.</p>
      <p>A video taken at the Nelspruit Newscafe parking lot on Friday night shows a violent clash between three people – two of them wielding guns.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that it began as a road rage incident at a nearby filling station before the fight and it continued to the Newscafe parking lot.</p>
      <p>In the video, <a href="https://www.dailysun.co.za/News">three young men can be seen engaging in a fist fight and kicking each other</a> before guns taken out.</p>
      <p>The owner of the Newscafe, Harris Zwane said the men were involved in a road rage incident at a filling station across the road before they proceeded to the shopping centre’s parking lot.</p>
      <aside>“I am aware of the video and I can confirm that nobody was shot. Shots were fired in the air. It is unfortunate that their fight ended at the shopping centre, where Newscafe is located.<br/>“We can assure patrons that security measures have been set up and to date there have been no reports of carjacking or any criminal activities,” he said.<br/>“With the services of a private security company we want to make sure that patrons are always safe. People should refrain from spreading false information about the incident.” he said.</aside>
      <p>Mpumalanga police spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi could not be reached for a comment.</p>
