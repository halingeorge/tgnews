      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:03:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>Three people including a suspect are dead after a shooting at a Walmart in Duncan, Okla., police confirmed to <a href="https://www.duncanbanner.com/suspect-in-walmart-shooting-dead-according-to-dpd/article_91453416-0a20-11ea-8c5c-1beafd2338c8.html#utm_campaign=blox&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">The Duncan Banner</a>. </p>
      <p>District Attorney Jason Hicks told the newspaper that the scene is contained and is no longer an active shooter situation. </p>
      <p>Police scanner calls at around 9:45 a.m. local time indicated a shooter at the Walmart, the Banner reported. </p>
      <p>Duncan Public Schools are also on lockdown, the newspaper added. </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Duncan Police Department was not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma’s new permit-less carry law, which went into effect earlier this month, reportedly allows most residents over 21 to carry concealed or unconcealed firearms without a license.</p>
