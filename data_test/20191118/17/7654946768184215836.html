      <h1>Dwayne Haskins begs for help from Redskins’ hapless offensive line</h1>

      <p>One sad sideline scene encapsulated the Redskins’ disastrous season.</p>
      <p>Amid the roar of “sell the team” chants from fans at FedEx Field on Sunday, beleaguered rookie quarterback <a href="https://twitter.com/NBC4Sports/status/1196180728603656192?s=20">Dwayne Haskins made an impassioned plea</a> to the Redskins’ seemingly disinterested offensive line: “What do I have to do to help you?”</p>
      <p>The former Rose Bowl MVP from Ohio State was sacked six times during <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/sam-darnolds-career-day-leads-jets-in-easy-win-over-redskins/">Sunday’s 34-17 loss to the Jets</a>.</p>
      <p>Quarterback play and pass protection have been massive issues all season for the 1-9 team. Haskins is the third quarterback, along with Case Keenum and Colt McCoy, to start for the team behind one of the worst offensive lines in the league. He has been sacked 10 times in his first two career starts. The Redskins also had a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/redskins-wont-pay-trent-williams-salary-as-feud-escalates/">highly publicized fallout</a> with seven-time Pro Bowl lineman Trent Williams, who has not played this season.</p>

      <p>The Jets jumped out to an early 13-0 lead and were up 34-3 in the fourth quarter. Haskins threw two garbage-time touchdowns late in the game and failed to capitalize on two first-half turnovers by the Jets. He finished the day completing 19 of 35 passes for 214 yards and one interception.</p>
      <p>Haskins, 22, was selected 15th overall in the 2019 NFL Draft. The Redskins signed Haskins to a standard four-year rookie contract in May that also comes with a fifth-year option in the 2023 season. His contract will make him an estimated $14.4 million, along with an $8.5 million signing bonus, <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/washington-redskins/dwayne-haskins-29050/">according to Spotrac</a>.</p>
      <p>He acknowledged after the game that he has a long way to go to earn the trust of his team.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough. You have guys who have been in the league a long time. As a young dude with a new voice, you have to earn their trust,” <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/18/dwayne-haskins-i-have-to-keep-earning-their-trust/">Haskins told NBCSportsWashington.com</a>. “You have to earn that ability to ask for what you see out there. As the game went on telling them what I want and what I think would help us make plays. They started listening to me. I have to keep earning that.”</p>
      <p>Interim head coach Bill Callahan says the rest of the season will be “a great learning experience” for Haskins.</p>
      <p>The Redskins’ next challenge comes against the Lions on Nov. 24.</p>
