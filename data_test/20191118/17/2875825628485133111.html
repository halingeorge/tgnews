      <h2>Telly favourite Scarlett Moffatt amazed her fans by sharing a snap of herself from 2011</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:54:57+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/scarlett-moffatt">Scarlett Moffatt</a> has shared an incredible throwback snap from eight years ago showing her looking totally different.</p>
      <p>In the picture, the Geordie lass, 29, is seen sporting a full fringe cut into her long dark locks.</p>
      <p>Scarlett admitted she found the throwback pretty hilarious, writing alongside the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> Story: "8 years ago today," with a line of laughing emojis.</p>
      <p>She's changed dramatically over the years since rising to fame on Channel 4's Gogglebox.</p>
      <p>The Bishop Auckland-born star went on to win I'm A Celebrity in 2017 and swiftly became a woman in demand.</p>
      <p>She joined Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and hosted I'm A Celeb Extra Camp until this year.</p>
      <p>As she threw herself into her new career as a TV presenter, Scarlett embraced a glam new image - a far cry from her casual look on Gogglebox.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Scarlett opened up about her body confidence issues, revealing she's finally learned to love her curves.</p>
      <p>She shared a sexy selfie told fans she's finally got the confidence to "show a little bit more skin".</p>
      <p>The telly sensation wore a plunging black dress to attend a cancer charity ball in London with her boyfriend Scott Dobinson.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Learning to show a bit more skin is becoming very liberating. Go on ladies flash a bit more &amp; own it."</p>
      <p>Scarlett went on to thank her glam squad for giving her the confidence to feel good in a revealing dress.</p>

      <p>Scarlett, who has been targeted for her changing shape over the years, previously discussed how she is now "really happy" and "embracing her body."</p>
      <p>In an aim to shut down trolls, the bubbly star explained she now shows-off her figure instead of covering up.</p>
      <p>"I'm not pretending that I'm the perfect body shape. I've got boobs and hips and rather than try and cover them up, I'm embracing them.</p>
      <p>"I'm trying to show them off a bit more,"she said.</p>
      <p>Scarlett has been bombarded with sickening abuse from trolls over the years, and last month she shared a video showing her crying over a nasty letter.</p>
      <p>The Googlebox star sobbed as she read out a mean hand-written note that called her "fat" with a "mouth that looks like a pork chop cut in half".</p>
