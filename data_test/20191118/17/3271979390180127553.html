      <p><b>Brad Pitt</b> is too cheap to buy his own clothes and relies on gifts from fashion companies? That’s the bizarre rumor in one of the tabloids. <b>Gossip Cop</b> has learned it’s completely untrue.</p>
      <p>The <i><b>Globe</b></i> slams Pitt with a variety of insults, calling him a “clothes hog” in the headline of its piece. Further describing the actor as a “penny-pinching member of Hollywood royalty,” anonymous insiders say he relies on freebies from high-end fashion houses for his wardrobe and accessories. “He’s always been a cheapskate and a miser with his money, but now he’s also become a total tightwad,” one source tells the magazine.</p>
      <p>“Brad makes no apologies for it either,” adds the anonymous insider. “He’s constantly bagging tons of high-priced designer clothes for absolutely nothing — and they’re not just last year’s castoffs, either.” The insider claims that the bulk of the suits the actor receives are $5,000 Armani and Tom Ford ensembles, with a variety of “freebie watches, sweaters and sunglasses” rounding out his collection.</p>
      <p>Pointing to his “early days as a Hollywood hippie” and his Midwestern roots, the source adds that Pitt “never spends more than $500 on clothes a month.” Instead, the unknown tipster claims he spends his time waiting for the next package to arrive. “For him, the best part about it is it’s free. A lot of celebs would give it to charity, but not clotheshorse Brad — he’s like a kid in a candy shop.”</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> ran the story by Pitt’s spokesperson, who’s going on the record to deny the story. It’s also interesting the tabloid describes Pitt as a “miser” considering its previous claim about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-throwing-out-belongings/">Angelina Jolie throwing out his extensive collection</a> of “valuable antiques” and rare first-edition books. If the outlet’s sources can’t decide if the actor is brutally frugal or a collector of untold valuables, why should we give them any credence?</p>
      <p>Plus, it’s not exactly like the actor is known for flashing bling or wearing the most cutting-edge fashion — Pitt’s most famous outfit is arguably just <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/brad-pitt-tests-out-new-signature-look.html">a casual combination of a long-sleeve shirt under a short-sleeve shirt</a> with <a href="https://jezebel.com/and-now-10-years-of-brad-pitt-s-newsboy-cap-1837881826">his well-documented newsboy cap</a>. Don’t get us wrong, Pitt’s a snappy dresser when he needs to be, but aside from the occasional red carpet or charity event, he isn’t going through suits on a daily basis.</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> previously busted the tabloid in May for a demonstrably false story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-wasting-away/">Pitt “wasting away” after his divorce from Jolie</a>. In March, the outlet used doctored photos to claim that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-secretly-eloped-mexico-married/">Pitt had secretly remarried Jennifer Aniston</a>, which we also debunked. The magazine clearly doesn’t have any idea about what’s happening in Pitt’s life or what’s in his closet.</p>
