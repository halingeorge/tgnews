      <h1>Voice star Craig Forsyth lined up for Ayrshire Christmas lights show that will rival Glasgow</h1>
      <h2>Organiser Sylvia Mallinson is promising a ‘sea of lights’ inspired by the city's Royal Exchange Square.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:00:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Toni Lennox, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/toni-lennox/</a></address>
      <p>Irvine is set for a spectacular £25k Christmas lights show to rival Glasgow’s Royal Exchange Square.</p>
      <p>Organiser Sylvia Mallinson is promising a ‘sea of lights’ inspired by the city’s famous festive illuminations.</p>
      <p>She said: “We’ve really concentrated on the lights this year, I would say it’s a show stopper.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t have any lights at all at the beginning of the year because they were broken.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Looking at how far the committee has come in the space of a year is something we’re all really proud of."</p>
      <p>"It'll be like the sea of lights over Royal Exchange Square. We'll have that all over The Cross."</p>
      <p>This year there will be no celebrity guest, instead the Irvine Special Event Forum have decided community stalwart Jim McHarg will do the honours.</p>

      <p>Jim, who is set to retire, worked with the Community Learning Development department for 30 years.</p>
      <p>Sylvia said: “Jim has worked in communities across North Ayrshire for three decades and we thought it would be a nice send off for him.”</p>
      <p>The Irvine Special Events Forum have secured a fun fair and The Voice singer Craig Forsyth to entertain the crowds.</p>
      <p>Organisers have also confirmed there will be a nativity scene on display at Caledonia House – the balcony above Iceland – and a special photo prop for families to capture a magical moment together.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sweet treats and refreshments will be available to purchase on the night.</p>
      <p>There are 25 volunteers offering a helping hand on the evening, but anyone wishing to take part are encouraged to reach out to the Irvine Special Events Forum.</p>
      <p>Sylvia said: “This is not a council-driven event, this is put on by the community for the community.</p>
      <p>“Let’s just spread a bit of love and Christmas cheer. The volunteers who help us give up their own time to try and do something for the town.</p>
      <p>“All the time and effort people give, lets try and be festive about it and be happy we have got something going up.”</p>
      <p>More acts are encouraged to get in touch to perform on the big night.</p>

      <p>Sylvia explained: “If anyone would like to grace our stage, it could be comedy, singing, dancing, magic, a school class, anything at all let us know and we’ll organise a slot for you to come on stage.</p>
      <p>“It’s a night for us to show off what great talent we have within the community. The Chritsmas light switch on is a great platform only available for one night.</p>
      <p>“All are welcome to perform.”</p>
      <p>Sylvia started organising the Christmas lights from 2013 and this will be her final year.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s been a great six years. A big thank you to the committee; Margaret, Ronnie, Annie, David, Carmen, Tracey and Bill. That’s everyone on the committee and this annual evening wouldn’t be possible without them.”</p>
      <p>As of 2020 a new committee could be taking over, although it has not been confirmed. Sylvia said: “Our main concentration make sure we had lights. This will be my last year organising the Christmas lights and we are hoping to pass the event on to a new committee. This way if a new committee comes on board they have something to start them off and they wont have to hire anything.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sylvia added:“We encourage everyone to come along and just have a great night.</p>
      <p>“If any local businesses would like to sponsor this event please reach out as we offer unique packages.”</p>
      <p>The lights will be erected this weekend ahead of the big night which is set for Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>The festivities begin at 3.30pm and Jim McHarg will switch on the lights at 6pm.</p>
