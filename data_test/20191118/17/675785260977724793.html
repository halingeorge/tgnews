      <h2>ITV producers have started briefing guests appearing on their popular morning shows about how they could fall victim to trolling</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:35:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV producers</a> have started warning guests who appear on their popular daytime shows that they could get viciously trolled by  viewers.</p>
      <p>This Morning and Good Morning Britain guests must acknowledge the threat of online abuse when they appear on screens across the nation.</p>
      <p>It was put into place following a review triggered by the suicide of Jeremy Kyle Show guest Steve Dymond earlier this year.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for ITV said: “The physical and mental health of everyone we work with is our highest priority.</p>
      <p>"We introduced this in line with ITV’s guidelines earlier this year.”</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10364878/itv-warn-guests-trolled-online/">The Sun</a> : "It's been referred to as 'vulnerability awareness'.</p>

      <p>"The aim is to make sure guests know exactly what they're in for.</p>
      <p>"ITV know contentious topics and fiery exchanges make for good ratings, but can stir up anger among viewers."</p>
      <p>This new policy came in when the TV channel published a Duty of Care charter in June after being criticised for a lack of aftercare.</p>

      <p>Tragic Jeremy Kyle guest Steve Dymond was found dead in his bedroom in May a suspected suicide days after appearing on the show.</p>
      <p>He reportedly failed a love-cheat lie-detector test on the confrontational daytime programme, which has since been axed.</p>
      <p>ITV later scrapped the show and brought in new measures to make sure all guests on the channel's shows are provided with adequate care.</p>
