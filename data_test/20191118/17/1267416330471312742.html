      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:15:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>TikTok says that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/technology/tiktok-alex-zhu-interview.html">doesn’t share user data</a> with China or its parent company amid privacy concerns around the company.</p>
      <p>The head of the company, Alex Zhu, told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/technology/tiktok-alex-zhu-interview.html"><i>New York Times</i></a> that TikTok does not disclose user data with its parent company, ByteDance. Zhu said that all of the user data is stored in Virginia with a backup server in Singapore.</p>
      <p>“The data of TikTok is only being used by TikTok for TikTok users,” he told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/technology/tiktok-alex-zhu-interview.html"><i>New York Times.</i></a></p>
      <p>TikTok is currently under a national security review in the United States due to beliefs that the app sends data to China. The U.S. government is also looking into TikTok’s growing influence in the country.</p>
      <p>Although the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tiktok-criticism-expansion-in-canada-1.5336375"><i>CBC</i></a> recently reported that TikTok is looking to expand in Canada, it’s unclear if the Canadian government has the same concerns with the app.</p>
      <p>The company is also looking to distance itself from its Chinese roots, according to a recent report from the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-looking-at-ways-to-shake-off-its-ties-to-china-11574073001?mod=e2tw"><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a>. It is taking steps to scrub its image as a Chinese company. The report states that TikTok is even looking to the United States in terms of financial growth in the future.</p>
