      <h1>Watch: Kanye West Brings Emotional 'Sunday Service' Performance to Joel Osteen's Megachurch</h1>
      <h2>Rap superstar Kanye West brought his “Sunday Service” traveling concert to Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church on Sunday, declaring that he is now working for Christ.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:49:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/benjkew/, Ben Kew</a></address>
      <p>On Sunday evening, the service began with the choir performing and Osteen recounting his journey in life as a minister.</p>
      <p>Kanye West performed gospel renditions of his latest songs with the backing of a large choir. He also led other classics including Stevie Wonder’s “Overjoyed,” SWV’s “Weak” and “Call His Name,” a twist on Destiny’s Child song “Say My Name.”</p>
      <p>West was later joined on stage by his wife, Kim Kardashian, and their children, before Osteen delivered an inspirational sermon.</p>

      <p>Tickets for the event were free, although they <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/16/free-tickets-to-kanye-west-performance-at-joel-osteens-church-scalped-for-hundreds-of-dollars/">sold out</a> within minutes, with scalpers then selling them online for hundreds of dollars.</p>
      <p>Before the service, West took part in a Q&amp;A with Osteen about the spiritual journey that led to him becoming a Born Again Christian and producing his latest gospel-themed album <i>Jesus is King. </i></p>
      <p>“Jesus has won the victory because now the greatest artist that God has ever created is now working for Him,” West said alongside Osteen.</p>
      <p>“When I was in my lowest points, God was there with me and sending me visions and inspiring me, and I remember sitting in the hospital at UCLA after having a mental breakdown and there’s documentation of me drawing a church and [wanting to] start a church in the middle of Calabasas,” he continued, in reference to his hospitalization in 2016 during his Saint Pablo tour.</p>

      <p>After declaring himself the greatest artist of all time, Kanye West went on to claim that all his “arrogance and cockiness” is now a thing of the past, because “God is now using him.”</p>
      <p>“Every time I stand up, I feel that I’m standing up and drawing a line in the sand and saying, ‘I’m here in service to God and no weapon formed against me shall prosper,’” he said. “Jesus has won the victory. I told you about my arrogance and cockiness already. Now the greatest artist that God has ever created is now working for him.”</p>
      <p>West’s comments come as he tours across the country as part of his “Sunday-service” orchestrations, where he is successfully <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/04/kanye-west-sunday-service-saw-1000-people-commit-their-lives-to-christ/">trying</a> to spread the word of God.</p>
      <p>Previous performances have taken place at the Coachella festival, an outdoor shopping center in Salt Lake City and at an Atlanta-area megachurch. Last week, he also <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/16/watch-kanye-west-brings-sunday-service-to-houston-jail-this-is-a-mission-not-a-show/">performed</a> for inmates at Houston’s Harris County Jail, describing the tour as a “mission, not a show.”</p>
      <p>For next week’s service, West <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-opera-nebuchadnezzar-hollywood-bowl-913874/">announced</a> on Monday plans to stage an opera called <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> at the Hollywood Bowl next Sunday.</p>
