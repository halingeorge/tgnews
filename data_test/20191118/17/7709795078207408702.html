        <b>Gerwyn Price insists Michael van Gerwen is "scared if me now" as he targets World Championship glory and top spot in the darts rankings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Welshman has now climbed to number three in the PDC Order of Merit after retaining his <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/sensational-price-wins-grand-slam/174173">Boylesports Grand Slam of Darts</a> title in blockbusting fashion at the weekend while he's now been slashed to 7/1 second favourite for the Ally Pally crown next month and 5/1 to win this weekend's Players Championship Finals.</p>
      <p>Peter Wright labelled Price as "unplayable" during Sunday's final in Wolverhampton, which the Iceman won 16-6 with a sparkling average of 107.86 just hours after claiming his first ever victory over MVG at the 20th attempt, and these kind of performances are starting to become the norm rather than just a hot streak of form.</p>

      <p>Price won all three group games before thrashing Darren Webster 10-1 and Gary Anderson 16-9 without hardly breaking sweat but he saved his very best for when it really mattered on the final day.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old headed into his clash with MVG with just a solitary draw from his 19 previous meetings but having taken the Dutchman to a deciding leg in all of their five matches in 2019, he knew that first scalp was just a matter of time.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="http://www.pdc.tv/">www.pdc.tv</a>: "Michael isÂ by far the best player in the world but he's there to be knocked off I think. It's going to be tough but if I can win next week and then win the Worlds then of course it's possible.</p>
      <p>"But doing it and saying it are two different things. He's scared of me now and I'm here to have him."</p>

      <p>However, the former rugby player has refused to big up his chances of lifting the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/world-darts-championship-2020/172777">Sid Waddell Trophy</a> on New Year's Day having lost in the last 64 stage in four of his five appearances.</p>
      <p>He said: "I just want to make sure I win my first game at the Worlds because as everyone knows I don't have the best record there. I just want to get through my first game in and then anything can happen, the first round is always the hardest but I'll give it a good shot.</p>
      <p>"My goal is to win my first game, have a decent Christmas and then enjoy being in the tournament rather than just watching it.</p>
      <p>"But first and foremost by focus is on next week at the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/players-championship-finals-2019/172920">Players Championship Finals</a>, hopefully I can go and have a good run in that."</p>
