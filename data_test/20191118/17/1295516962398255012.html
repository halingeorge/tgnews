      <p>Werner Herzog has given his seal of approval to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-the-mandalorian-asset-baby-yoda-spoiler/">Baby Yoda, aka "the Asset,"</a> admitting it brought tears to his eyes on the set of the Disney+ <i>Star Wars</i> series <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-mandalorian/">The Mandalorian</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Herzog plays the Client, the person who hires the titular bounty hunter <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-mandalorian-baby-yoda/">to steal the child for him</a>, and he revealed the emotional gravity of the baby impacted on him even though he's yet to see it on screen. "I have seen it on the set. I've seen it on the set," he told <i>Variety</i>. "And it's heartbreaking! It's heartbreakingly beautiful."</p>

      <p>He explained how he was moved witnessing two technicians operating its various mechanisms, saying, "one was for the eyes and the mouth and the other one was for other facial expressions." Herzog, who admits he hasn't seen <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-mandalorian-werner-herzog-jon-favreau-films/">any <i>Star Wars</i> movies</a> or anything from the portfolio of showrunner Jon Favreau, also said it was "a phenomenal technological achievement but, beyond the technological achievement, it's heartbreaking."</p>
      <p>When asked why the animatronic was so heartbreaking to him, Herzog made it clear the innocence of it touched his soul. "It looked absolutely convincing," he continued. "It made you cry when you saw it."</p>
