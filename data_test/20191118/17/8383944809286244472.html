      <h1>US issues 90-day extension of Huawei license</h1>

      <p>The Trump administration on Monday issued a new 90-day extension allowing U.S. companies to continue doing business with China's Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. as U.S. regulators continue crafting rules on telecommunications firms that pose national security risks.</p>
      <p>After adding Huawei to an economic blacklist in May citing national security concerns, the U.S. Commerce Department has allowed it to purchase some American-made goods in a series of 90-day license extensions that it says is aims to minimize disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America.</p>
      <p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday that some rural carriers need the temporary licenses and are dependent on Huawei for 3G and 4G networks.</p>
      <p>"There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities â€“ we don't want to knock them out. So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate," Ross said.</p>
      <p>The development comes amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for over a year.</p>
      <p>In blacklisting Huawei, the U.S. government said it had a "reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests." Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations.</p>
