      <p>Making lists on your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_share-reminders-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-64gb-black-verizon%2F6341340.p%3FskuId%3D6341340">iPhone</a> is an easy way to stay organized – but it’s even more helpful when you can share them.</p>
      <p>Reminders is one of the apps that come pre-downloaded on your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_share-reminders-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-64gb-black-verizon%2F6341340.p%3FskuId%3D6341340">iPhone</a> (along with Calendar, Notes, and others), and you can sync these apps across devices using <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/icloud">iCloud</a> to access your checklists anywhere.</p>
      <p>In addition to checking off and organizing items, you can easily share your lists with friends and family if your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_share-reminders-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-64gb-black-verizon%2F6341340.p%3FskuId%3D6341340">iPhone</a> is running <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ios-13">iOS 13</a>. This “Add People” option is helpful for group events – such as birthday parties or family reunions – or shared tasks such as grocery shopping.</p>
      <p>The Reminders app gives you the option to share the link directly by copy and pasting, or by sending an invitation to edit the list through iMessage, Mail, or social media.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to share a list.</p>
