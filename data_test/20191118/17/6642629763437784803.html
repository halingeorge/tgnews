      <p>Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest rose to its highest in more than a decade this year, government data on Monday showed, confirming a sharp rise under the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) space research agency said deforestation reached 9,762 square kilometres, up 29.5 percent, for the 12 months through July 2019.</p>

      <p>That's the worst level of deforestation since 2008, heaping further pressure on the environmental policy of Bolsonaro who took office in January and favours developing the Amazon region economically.</p>
      <p>At a briefing to discuss the numbers, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said the rise in deforestation showed the need for a new strategy to combat the illegal logging, mining and land grabbing, which he said were to blame for the increase in deforestation.</p>
      <p>He added he would meet with governors of Amazon states on Wednesday to further discuss tactics to counter deforestation.</p>
      <p>All options are on the table for countering deforestation, including activating the military for use in environmental enforcement operations, Salles said. </p>
      <h3>'Bolsonaro responsible for every inch'</h3>
      <p>Critics have accused Bolsonaro of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/brazil-environmental-chief-resigns-criticism-190107161353404.html">weakening</a> Brazil's environmental agency, IBAMA. They say his rhetoric has emboldened illegal loggers, miners and farmers and created a climate of impunity for those felling the forest illegally.</p>
      <p>Greenpeace, an environmentalists organisation, placed the blame for the most recent data squarely on Bolosonaro. </p>
      <p>"The Bolsonaro government is responsible for every inch of forest destroyed. This government today is the worst enemy of the Amazon," said Marcio Astrini, public policy coordinator for Greenpeace, in a statement.</p>
      <p>Brazil's Climate Observatory, a network of non-governmental organisations that includes Greenpeace, said that the 2019 increase in deforestation was the fastest in percentage terms since the 1990s and the third fastest of all-time.</p>
      <p>Within a day of taking office, Bolsonaro signed an executive order making Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture responsible for the regulation and creation of new indigenous reserves, in a move widely seen as a boost for the country's powerful agribusiness lobby.</p>
      <p>Months later, the INPE recorded more fires raging across the Amazon from January to August than any time since the agency began recording the blazes in 2013. </p>
      <p>Environmentalists and non-governmental organisations said the fires, which are partially a natural seasonal phenomenon, were more widespread because of farmers setting the forest alight to clear land for pasture and loggers razing the forest for its wood.</p>
      <p>Since taking office, the Brazilian leader has maintained an adversarial relationship with the INPE, which is a research unit of the country's science ministry. </p>
      <p>In August, the head of INPE, Ricardo Galvao, was<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/brazil-scientist-sacked-deforestation-row-president-190803064750760.html"> dismissed</a> after a public dispute with Bolsonaro, in which Galvao accused Bolsonaro of "cowardice" for questioning deforestation satellite imagery released by the agency. </p>
      <p>Bolsonaro had previously described INPE figures as a lie and said Galvao might be working "in service to some NGO".</p>
      <p>The president did not immediately comment on the most recent numbers. </p>
