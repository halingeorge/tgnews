      <h1>Sabri Lamouchi is demanding 'better' from his Nottingham Forest stars</h1>
      <h2>The Reds lost two on the spin after the last international stoppage and will hope for better at Ashton Gate this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Sabri Lamouchi has demanded his <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> players return from the latest international break in better shape than the previous one.</p>
      <p>Forest went on a 10-game unbeaten run prior to October’s pause for internationals, form which also saw the Frenchman become the first City Ground chief to collect a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/sabri-lamouchi-nottingham-forest-manager-3415507">Manager of the Month award</a> since Billy Davies in 2013.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the break <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/sport-opinion/forest-manager-month-curse-lamouchi-3434544">appeared to arrive at a bad time for Forest</a>, returning to action with successive defeats at Wigan and then three days later in front of their own supporters against Hull, without scoring a goal.</p>
      <p>Since the reverse to the Tigers and a frustrating postponement with Reading, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-january-transfer-news-3537390">Lamouchi's men </a>have reacted well, winning at Luton before winning a third straight game against Derby County.</p>

      <p>This time, however, Forest will know exactly what faces them on Saturday when Championship football takes pride of place once more and they face a stern test of their promotion credentials at Bristol City, a side only below them on goal difference.</p>
      <p>“Rest, of course I will enjoy my rest,” Lamouchi said of his plans for the final break of 2019, before the festive period takes hold.</p>
      <p>“We will come back to work, to try to come back in a better way than the last international break and to prepare for the Bristol City game,” he told Nottinghamshire Live.</p>

      <p>Lamouchi also highlighted the importance of leading striker <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/lewis-grabban">Lewis Grabban</a>, following his seventh goal of a prolific start to the season which was enough to see off Derby last time out.</p>
      <p>“He’s a fantastic striker, he works a lot for the team. He’s fighting, he creates space for the other players.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/grabban-nottingham-forest-luis-suarez-3546914">Grabban</a> is our finisher.”</p>
