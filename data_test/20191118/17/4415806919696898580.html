      <h1>Roy Keane’s big regret is writing his first book</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:25:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/larry-ryan/" target="_blank">By Larry Ryan</a></address>
      <p>Roy Keane regrets penning an autobiography while still a player.</p>
      <p>Asked, in an interview with UCFB for the League Managers Association, about the things he’d change in his career, Keane says: “Loads, of course, but you can’t. Instead of thinking about the things I could have done differently, I always count my blessings.”</p>
      <p>But he does wish he’d skipped the invitation to release his first book in 2002. ‘Keane’, ghostwritten by Eamon Dunphy, was published following Keane’s controversial departure from the World Cup.</p>
      <p>Keane says: “Regrets about my first book. I don’t think it’s a good idea to write a book when you’re still playing. Obviously, I done a book when I was 32, around the World Cup.”</p>
      <p>The book was a best-seller but Keane was banned for five matches by the Football Association, and fined £150,000, after a passage in the book indicated that his infamous red-card tackle on Alfe-Inge Haaland was premeditated.</p>
      <p>Keane released another book, ‘The Second Half’, in 2014, this time written with Roddy Doyle.</p>

      <p>“I enjoyed my second book a lot better because of the person who wrote the book for me, Roddy Doyle. Obviously, I was retired then, it was more relaxing. I’d meet Roddy every week, I’d go to Dublin or he’d come over to Manchester. We’d have a chit-chat and he’d put things together. I found that more relaxing because I had more time to check things over when I was looking at it.</p>
      <p>“I had no real plans to do a second book but the book company got in touch with me and they had Roddy, but I said, ‘nah, no interest’.</p>
      <p>“I met Roddy in Dublin for a cup of tea, not that Roddy was desperate to do the book but we thought if we got together, see if there’s any chemistry. As soon as I met him, I thought, let’s go for it. This guy is class.</p>
      <p>“My first book I was still playing and my focus was still on being a player. Roddy was a really good guy, I enjoyed his company, classy guy. And I think he wrote a decent book. I hope that doesn't sound really cocky.</p>
      <p>We kept it very simple. I’m still in touch with Roddy to this day. A good man and a good writer.</p>
      <p>“No regrets about the second book but I certainly shouldn't have done the first one while I was still playing.”</p>
      <p>In a wide-ranging interview, Keane says he still hopes to return to management and doesn’t yet see himself as a football pundit.</p>
      <p>“I still don’t see myself as a pundit but if people see me as that, so be it.</p>
      <p>“People sometimes watch me when I’m doing it and think I’m a bit serious. But if they want a comedian they can get somebody else</p>
      <p>I’m there to give my professional opinion on a game. I try and be fair on the players and the management.”</p>
      <p>As for the best player he faced in his career, Keane chooses Zinedine Zidane: “He was a brilliant payer. He was big, he was strong he was nasty and he could score a goal. He was a tough player to play against, world class.”</p>
