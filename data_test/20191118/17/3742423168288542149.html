      <p>This week, <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/11/australian-disney-plus-lineup-announced">Disney gave Australians a taste</a> of the content that will be coming to its streaming service, Disney+.

      <h3>When Is Disney Plus Coming To Australia?</h3>

      <p>Disney Plus will be hitting Australian and New Zealand's shores on 19 November, one week after it launches in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands. For countries outside of these five, it's expected to launch "within the first two years."</p>
      <p>This means, shockingly, Australia is one of the first countries in the world to experience Disney's new streaming service, ahead of more obvious countries like the United Kingdom.</p>
      <h3>How Much Will Disney+ Cost In Australia?</h3>

      <p>Pricing is an important point for many of us who are already subscribed to one or more streaming services. Disney+ will be offered for $8.99 per month (or $89.99 per year) while our Kiwi mates will pay $NZD9.99 per month.</p>
      <p>A few months ago, we speculated <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/08/reports-suggest-disney-and-stan-are-teaming-up/">Disney+ might be in talks with Nine</a>, who owns Stan. It's important because it might mean a bundle package is on the way for a cheaper deal so we can continue to enjoy Stan as well as the Disney+ service. It's not yet clear whether a deal was struck between the two and whether Foxtel will separately arrange a deal for their audiences.</p>

      <h3>What Content Will Disney+ Have?</h3>

      <p>It's expected Disney will claw back all its Disney, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic content from local streaming services. That's a whole lotta big releases all neatly placed on the one service.</p>
      <p>To give you an idea of the enormity, here's what's confirmed to be on the service when it launches:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Upcoming releases</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Mandalorian</li>
        <li>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</li>
        <li>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</li>
        <li>Encore!</li>
        <li>Lady and the Tramp</li>
        <li>Noelle</li>
        <li>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</li>
        <li>Frozen 2</li>
        <li>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Classics</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Simpsons</li>
        <li>Captain Marvel</li>
        <li>Avengers: Endgame</li>
        <li>Aladdin</li>
        <li>Toy Story 4</li>
        <li>The Lion King</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Wait, what happens to Stan's content library?</h3>
      <p>It's been speculated that Stan's mammoth deal with Disney last year will run out in October. While this is still unconfirmed, it makes a lot of sense as a Disney+ launch in November will mean a smooth-ish transition into the new streaming service. It seems unlikely Stan will continue to host the <i>obvious</i> Disney content, which classic animated movies and their remakes (for e.g. <i>Aladdin</i>, <i>The Lion King</i>), the <i>Star Wars</i> series, Pixar productions (like <i>Toy Story</i>) and movies from the Marvel Universe.</p>
      <p>What's unclear right now is whether Hulu content (e.g.<i> The Handmaid's Tale</i>, <i>Veronica Mars</i> S4) will continue to premiere on SBS On Demand or Stan until the first-run rights expire. Hulu is a US-based streaming service that produces original content, similar to Netflix, but was purchased this year by Walt Disney Studios. In the US, it was revealed Disney would be offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for the low price of $US13 a month (around $19.50).</p>
      <p>Lifehacker Australia has reached out to Stan for comment.</p>
