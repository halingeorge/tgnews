      <p>Heidelberg Cement group will take both organic and inorganic routes to increase its production capacity from the current 12 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 20 mtpa, said a top executive.</p>
      <p>“We are looking for cement companies with a capacity ranging from 5-10 mtpa,” J.N. Cooper, managing director, Heidelberg Cement Group, said. “We are in talks with cement firms that do not want to get into the National Company Law Tribunal. But we are unable to give more details,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cooper heads two units – HeidelbergCement India Ltd. (HCIL), a listed firm, and Zuari Cement Ltd.</p>
      <p>HCIL has presence in Central India, while Zuari Cement has strong presence in Southern India. The capacity utilisation of these plants are in the range of 92% and 60-65% respectively. The combined turnover of these firms is ₹4,500 crore.</p>
      <p>Regarding pending projects, he said it was proposed to set up a ₹4,000-crore 3-mtpa project in Gujarat and another 5-mtpa plant in Kalaburgi, which had been put on the backburner for the time being.</p>
      <p>On the expansion plan, he said Zuari Cement was putting up a waste heat recovery unit in Yerraguntla in Andhra Pradesh at an outlay of about ₹200 crore that would generate 22 MW power. Very soon, Sitapuram Power Ltd. in Andhra Pradesh would be merged with Zuari Cement. The Sitapuram Power plant has a capacity to generate 43 MW of power. HCIL would increase its capacity by 0.5-mtpa in phases through debottlenecking by investing ₹50 crore.</p>
      <p>To a question, he said there was a proposal to merge both the companies, but it could not be carried out due to certain reasons.</p>
