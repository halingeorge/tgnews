        <b>We’re creeping closer to a return to domestic action, but for now international games take centre stage as well as the influence of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>.</b>

      <h3>Klopp culture the key for Reds success</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> has been a massive factor in Liverpool’s upward turn in fortunes; of that there can be no doubt.</p>
      <p>Even so, the level of impact he has had at the club is enormously impressive, with his brand of positivity and determination to win having seeped into every player and supporter.</p>
      <p>And his approach to management has been <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/jurgen-klopps-culture-continues-to-reap-rewards-as-reds-duo-remain-hungry-for-more/">hailed by two absolutely critical members of the first-team squad</a>: <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a>.</p>
      <p>Praise doesn’t come much more relevant than from those two – and the latter also speaks about his own positional changes.</p>
      <h3>International wrap</h3>

      <p>We are still in the international break, with several players still to feature.</p>
      <p>In case you missed anything over the weekend, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/jurgen-klopps-culture-continues-to-reap-rewards-as-reds-duo-remain-hungry-for-more/">continued his massive upturn in fortunes</a>, while Van Dijk <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/virgil-van-dijk-withdraws-from-netherlands-squad-due-to-personal-reasons/">departed from the Netherlands squad</a> early.</p>
      <p>On Monday, there’s not much from a Liverpool perspective to worry about, but our Brazilian contingent are in action on Tuesday.</p>
      <h3>Youth progress a point of discussion</h3>

      <p>We’re always looking to the future at Liverpool, whether that’s with refining Academy processes, investing in personnel or making sure the pathway from youth to first-team level is as open as possible.</p>
