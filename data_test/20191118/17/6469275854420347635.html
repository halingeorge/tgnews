      <p>From friends and family, to people she had nursed at the Royal Preston Hospital, here's a selection of the messages we received:</p>
      <p>Katy looked after our Dad on the neurosurgery ward for 9 months a couple of years ago. She was an absolutely amazing nurse and the care and compassion she showed for Dad (and us) is something we will always remember. It's an absolute travesty she has passed away at such a young age. My thoughts go out to her family, friends and colleagues</p>
      <p>

      <p>Such a shame. This beautiful lady has spent years helping others, it's just a shame nothing could help her.</p>

      <p>How very sad. A young, vibrant life, snatched away far too soon. I hope she is at peace now. Thoughts and sympathies with her family and friends. Rest peacefully.</p>

      <p>So sad. I can never thank the neurological staff enough for their care of my husband in 2015. This wonderful lady was part of the team. RIP.</p>

      <p>This is so shocking. I remember her as a student nurse then as a passionate caring nurse, who looked after her own students so well. I am crushed to learn of this tragic news. My heart goes out to all her family and friends. Bless you Katy xx</p>

      <p>This is such awful news Katy was an amazing nurse so kind and great sense of humour she helped to look after me on neuro for a few weeks I haven’t got many memories of my time there but can remember Katy sending my condolences to all her family friends and colleagues life is so cruel</p>
