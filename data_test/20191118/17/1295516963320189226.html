      <h1>Crisis on Infinite Earths Star Promises We'll Meet Anti-Monitor 'Very Soon'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:11:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Meagan Damore</a></address>
      <p>The Anti-Monitor is coming for the <i>Arrow</i>verse -- perhaps sooner than you'd think. Asked about the imminent arrival of the major <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">"Crisis on Infinite Earths"</a> villain, star LaMonica Garrett told <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-infinite-earths-lamonica-garrett-anti-monitor-interview/">CBR</a> that he will turn up sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>"I think you'll see him pretty soon. It's not going to be at the end of 'Crisis,'" Garrett teased. "His presence will be felt before you physically see him and that's already been happening."</p>

      <p>"I think that's great, how they layer it out when you see certain characters and when you don't. It's not oversaturated," he added. "You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to 'Crisis.' I think they did a great job of that, without giving too much away. But you'll know he's around and, when you see him, it'll definitely be felt."</p>

      <p>Here, Garrett is likely referring to events that are taking place on both <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash-tv/"><i>The Flash</i></a> and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/arrow/"><i>Arrow</i></a>. For one, the <i>Arrow</i> Season 8 premiere saw <a href="https://www.cbr.com/arrow-earth-2-destroyed-antimatter/">the destruction of Earth-2</a> by antimatter, which is the Anti-Monitor's <i>modus operandi</i>. Further, in "Leap of Faith," Oliver <a href="https://www.cbr.com/arrow-oliver-meets-daughter-mia/">discovered a journal</a> with a sketched image of the Anti-Monitor that described him as "a god who possessed the power to see all that is and all that will be... this god would bring forth the end of times: the annihilation of all things." This led Oliver to believe that the Monitor, not his brother the Anti-Monitor, may have ill intent.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, on <i>The Flash</i>, Dr. Harrison "Nash" Wells -- a self-proclaimed <a href="https://www.cbr.com/flash-shazam-eternium-rock-of-eternity/">"multiversal explorer and provider of scientific miracles"</a> -- is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/flash-crisis-on-infinite-earths-nash-wells-pariah/">in hot pursuit</a> of the Monitor. His search has led him to a secret chamber deep underground on Earth-1, which could very well be the Anti-Monitor's prison. After all, Nash actor Tom Cavanagh <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths-tom-cavanagh-pariah-portrait/">is due to play Pariah</a> -- the man who accidentally unleashed the Anti-Monitor in the comic book event of the same name -- during the upcoming crossover.</p>
      <p>"Crisis on Infinite Earths" begins Sunday, Dec. 8 and 8 p.m. ET/PT on <i>Supergirl</i>, then continues in <i>Batwoman</i> on Monday, Dec. p at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>The Flash</i> on Tuesday, Dec, 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. After the winter hiatus, the crossover will conclude on Tuesday, Jan. 14 in <i>Arrow</i> at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i> at 9 p.m. ET/PT.</p>
