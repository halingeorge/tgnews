      <h1>This historic house is free — but it comes with a major catch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:08:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Jordi Lippe-McGraw</a></address>
      <p>Known for its charming downtown, top-rated public schools and bustling arts culture, Montclair, NJ is a hot spot when it comes to real estate. But a stunning three-story Victorian home just off the main drag can’t find a buyer — even though it’s free.</p>
      <p>The 3,330-square-foot home at 23 N. Willow St. is owned by Redeemer Montclair Church next door and currently used as office space and for the children’s ministry. The religious organization wants to build a new structure and therefore has plans to demolish the 1910 six-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house.</p>
      <p>But given the history and architectural details, the Historic Preservation Committee in town asked if they could make the house available to someone for free.</p>
      <p>The catch? The new owner would have to pay to move it.</p>
      <p>“Save it and move it,” Kathleen Bennett, the chairwoman of the Historic Preservation Committee, <a href="https://www.nj.com/essex/2019/11/this-montclair-house-is-being-given-away-for-free-there-is-one-catch.html">told NJ.com</a>. “Then it would be saved and loved by another generation.”</p>
      <p>The problem is the cost. While there’s no exact figure as to how much it would be to relocate it, <a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Montclair_NJ/overview">Realtor.com estimates</a> the price tag could range from $150,000 to $200,000. Plus, the owner would also have to move the power lines temporarily to move the house physically.</p>
      <p>“That’s just as big of an obstacle as the cost,” senior pastor Daniel Ying told the local website.</p>
      <p>Though that seems like a lot of money, it could still be a deal given that the median home price in the area is $699,000, according to Realtor.com. Ying revealed some people have inquired about the home, and one person stopped by, but no one expressed serious interest.</p>
      <p>If you are interested, there’s still time as the church won’t move forward with the demolition until January. But someone needs to decide in the next few weeks since the logistics of the project will likely take some time to sort out.</p>
      <p>Incredibly, this isn’t the first time a Montclair house was on the market for a bottom-dollar price. In 2017, another historic home was listed for $10 if the buyer was willing to move it. The cheap price tag didn’t work, and the house was ultimately torn down and replaced with an eight-lot subdivision.</p>
