      <p>Season-2 of the Pro Volleyball League (PVL) may not happen after all!</p>
      <p>The Volleyball Federation of India (VFI), at its annual general body meeting on Monday, announced it had terminated the contract with Baseline Ventures, PVL co-owners, following a “breach of agreement”.</p>
      <p>In a press release, VFI said “it has decided to amicably settle/[sent] termination notice to Baseline Ventures India Private Limited with immediate effect since they [Baseline Ventures] have breached the agreement.”</p>
      <p>The release stated the VFI had decided to rename PVL as Indian Volley League (IVL) or National Volleyball League (NVL) and conduct it from February 25, 2020.</p>
      <p>The release added that the venues, broadcaster and franchisees would be “communicated in due course”. Six to eight teams will be participating, it said.</p>
      <p>“The house”, the statement emphasised, “has unanimously authorised the Governing Council to take all major decisions for the conduct of the League.”</p>
      <p>VFI president S. Vasudevan, executive vice-president Raj Kumar, secretary Ramavtar Singh Jakhar, senior vice-president Rathin Roy Chaudhary and treasurer Shekhar Bose attended the meeting which saw the participation of 30 affiliated States/units.</p>
      <p>Baseline Ventures CEO Joy Bhattacharjya said the VFI decision had come as a “complete surprise”.</p>
      <p>He said the VFI president and secretary, FIVB secretary and Baseline Ventures had agreed at a meeting on November 1 in New Delhi to hold the PVL from February 7, 2020. “It was also announced [on Nov. 7] that the FIVB president would attend the [PVL] final. We await a formal communication from VFI,” Bhattacharjya said.</p>
      <p>VFI secretary Jakhar could not be reached for comment.</p>
