      <p>Months after parting ways from football club Billericay Town, a millionaire returned to England’s non-league football for a new stint.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old Glenn Tamplin now owns Romford FC, and after taking over the club he appointed himself as the manager by dismissing the long-serving Paul Martin.</p>
      <p>In addition, he recruited 15 new players for the squad, promising to lift the team from the bottom of the league.</p>
      <p>“I could’ve got involved at Macclesfield or Welling but I like a challenge – I had to go somewhere with potential, that was lower than where I went before because I need to do it bigger than I’ve done before,” Tamplin told the <i>BBC </i>while explaining his decision to buy the club<i>.  </i></p>
