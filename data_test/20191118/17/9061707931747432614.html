      <h2>International call-ups caused it to be called off on Saturday</h2>

      <p>Burton Albion's home League One clash with Southend United will now be played on Tuesday, December 3</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton-albion">The Brewers</a> were originally scheduled to host Southend on Saturday, November 16 but due to three Albion players being called up for international duty, that fixture was postponed.</p>
      <p>Nathan Broadhead is in the Wales' under-21s squad, Kieran O'Hara is in the Republic of Ireland squad and Liam Boyce is included in Michael O'Neill's Northern Ireland set-up for their European Championship qualifiers against the Netherlands, which they drew 0-0 on Saturday, and Germany, which is being played on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The rearrangement means Burton now have two successive home games in a week, with Lincoln City visiting on Saturday, December 7.</p>
      <p>The Brewers have already had games against Sunderland and Bolton Wanderers postponed earlier this season because of international call-ups. They will be playing Sunderland away next Tuesday, November 26</p>
