      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:18:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge takes Prince Louis to weekly £12 Monkey Music classes, a source has claimed.</p>
      <p>Kate and the little royal get fully involved in the fun activities, including singing and dancing.</p>
      <p>It's understood that they attend one of the popular company's Heigh-Ho classes as they are designed for little ones over the age of 12 months - as Louis is 19 months.</p>
      <p>However the exact location of the class they attend has not been shared.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7693691/TALK-TOWN-Kate-Louis-ape.html">Daily Mail</a> 's Charlotte Griffiths explains: "There are dozens of the events run all over the country every day, and for security reasons I won’t say which class Kate attends.</p>
      <p>"However, I can reveal that she gets stuck in.</p>

        <figcaption>The classes are very popular</figcaption>

      <p>“The classes are led by a monkey puppet who asks mums to sing with their babies and dance around the room holding scarfs."</p>
      <p>In their bid to give George, Charlotte and Louis as normal an upbringing as possible, Kate and husband Prince William are said to try and do as many things with them as possible.</p>
      <p>They are both regulars on the school run at Thomas's Battersea's, where the older two Cambridge kids are pupils, and they go to parent events.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Kate popped to the pub with a group of other mums from  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-george">George</a>  and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/princess-charlotte">Charlotte</a>  's school - and she managed to go undetected thanks to a secret door set up for Harry.</p>

      <p>Kate attended 'meet and greet' drinks party for parents of children who joined the school in September, including little Charlotte.</p>
      <p>The event was held at the Hollywood Arms in Chelsea, which used to be a popular hangout for London socialites.</p>
      <p>Kate's brother-in-law  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a>  used to be a regular there, so much so that the former owners created a secret entrance for him so he could come and go without being photographed, reports the  <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7643339/TALK-TOWN-Kates-secret-door-school-run-mums-bash-courtesy-Prince-Harry.html">Mail on Sunday</a>  .</p>
      <p>While a more relaxed location now, the pub used to be known for its wild parties and impressive guestlists.</p>
      <p>The school event was held in the pub's private room the Boulevard Bar, which costs £2,500 to hire for the evening.</p>
      <p>Kate had just one protection officer with her who was in the background while she chatted with the other mums and dads.</p>
