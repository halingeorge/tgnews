      <h1>Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom struggles with concept of money</h1>
      <h2>The Tories' business chief made a telling gaffe in her interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson on the Today programme when asked about her party's plans for business rates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:27:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom was roundly mocked when she was asked to clarify the government's position on business rates.</p>
      <p>The Tories have suggested they could slash rates to help businesses but it is unclear how funding lost by councils would be replaced.</p>
      <p>The one-time leadership hopeful was grilled by Nick Robinson about the plans.</p>
      <p>He aid: "Councils are very, very dependent on business rates. It's about a third of their revenues. It was zero a decade ago.</p>
      <p>"So, it's quite simple, isn't it? Council spending goes up or council spending has to go down or you have to put up the taxes of the rest of us if you are actually going to reduce business rates.</p>
      <p>"So, which of those appeals?</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>In response, Leadsom said: "Well, those aren't the options that are necessarily open.</p>
      <p>"What we want to do is restructure business rates and make sure that we make it fairer so high street shops aren't penalised against online businesses.</p>
      <p>"It is vital that businesses pay their fair share of tax. What we've seen that since we've reduced corporation tax from 28 per cent to 19 per cent, making it the lowest in the G20, is that we've seen an increase in the amount of tax taken by the exchequer and it's businesses that are contributing to the public services that we all want to see invested in.</p>
      <p>Robinson wasn't convinced by that answer.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He shot back: "Sure but you say that some businesses will pay more so that those high street businesses will pay less."</p>
      <p>Leadsom said that she wasn't saying that, prompting Robinson to ask "where the money was coming from then?"</p>
      <p>The Tory then uttered the immortal line of "You're assuming that money comes from somewhere.</p>
      <p>"What I'm trying to explain to you is that since our headline reduction in the rate of corporation tax the HMRC's tax intake has actually increased by something like 45%."</p>
      <p>Even the veteran political journalist Nick Robinson appeared to mock her reply.</p>
      <p>He later tweeted: "When I asked Andrea Leadsom how the Conservatives would pay to cut business rates she replied 'You're assuming that money comes from somewhere."'Well, yes ..."</p>
