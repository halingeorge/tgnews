      <p>Olloclip is out today with its new <a href="http://bit.ly/37gWbys">external camera lens systems</a> for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro/Pro Max with the goal of improving the shots the already great cameras can produce.</p>
      <p>Olloclip launched the new <a href="http://bit.ly/37gWbys">external lens system bundles</a> on its website today.</p>
      <p>Included with the new systems are telephoto, fish eye, and macro lenses as well as the clip attachment and a Bluetooth shutter button remote. The clip and lenses work for both the rear-facing and TrueDepth Camera on the front of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.</p>
      <p>The clip attaches to iPhone 11 smartphones without a case or with a <a href="https://olloclip.com/collections/all">compatible Olloclip case</a>. So keep in mind you won’t be able to use an existing case while using the Olloclip camera system.</p>
      <p>
