      <p>Rachael Blackmore made it five wins from as many starts on the Henry De Bromhead-trained Honeysuckle in the conditions’ hurdle at odds of 30/100 favourite at Fairyhouse.</p>
      <p>On her seasonal reappearance, the five-year-old took up the running at the fourth last and the partnership, Grade 1 winners over the course and distance in April, raced to an 11-length victory over the Willie Mullins pair, Easy Game and Mister Blue Sky.</p>
      <p>The Hatton’s Grade Hurdle at Fairyhouse early next month is the immediate target.</p>
      <p>Denis Hogan landed the 2m handicap hurdle with the Platinum Thoroughbred Racing Club-owned Solar Heat. Mark Enright was on board as the 12/1 chance scored by two lengths.</p>
      <p>Blackmore landed a bigger success when the De Bromhead-trained Notebook scored a taking success in the Grade 2 Craddockstown Novice Chase at Punchestown on Saturday.</p>
      <p>She excelled on the 11/4 chance which raced clear from the second last fence to win by five lengths from his own stable companion Moon Over Germany. </p>
