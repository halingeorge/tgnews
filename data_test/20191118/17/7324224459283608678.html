      <p>Her only option to repay Banks is to become an assassin, accessing the memories of her ancestor, a blind man named Omar Khalid. During her training, Banks tells Aliyah of the centuries-old battle between the Assassins and Templars, imploring her to help him decode a secret message inscribed on an illegal form of currency during the Great Recoinage of 1696.</p>
      <p>Steve Carsey, Audible UK’s director of original content, said: “Anthony Del-Col’s epic script – and sensational performances from Emmy Award-winning Riz Ahmed, Anthony Head and a full cast – will satisfy both existing fans of the game and introduce a whole new audience to the eternal battle which rages between the Assassins and Templars.”</p>
      <p>Aymar Azaizia, transmedia and business development director at Ubisoft, said: “We are really proud to announce our collaboration with Audible to create the first audio drama inspired by an Ubisoft game.</p>
      <p>“As an entertainment company, we are always looking after new ways to immerse players into our worlds, and we strongly believe Assassin’s Creed Gold offers a great opportunity for all our fans to dive into a new storyline inspired by Assassin’s Creed franchise.”</p>
      <p>Assassin’s Creed Gold is available for pre-order at audible.co.uk and will be available to download in the spring.</p>
