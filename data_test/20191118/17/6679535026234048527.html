      <p>Chidambaram Town police have registered a case against a Dikshithar of Sri Nataraja temple in Chidambaram for assaulting a woman devotee.</p>
      <p>According to the town police, a case has been registered under section 294 (b), 323 of Indian Penal Code and 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act against Dharshan Dikshitar based on a complaint given by S. Latha, a nurse working in a Primary Health Centre in Ayyankudi, near Chidambaram on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Latha, in her complaint, alleged that the dikshitar slapped her when she questioned him for performing puja even before she could tell her son’s details. According to the complaint, she visited the temple as Saturday was her son’s birthday. She offered puja material to the dikshitar and before she could tell him the star sign, he went inside the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> to perform the puja. When she questioned the dikshitar, he apparently slapped her. The priest was absconding, the police added.</p>
