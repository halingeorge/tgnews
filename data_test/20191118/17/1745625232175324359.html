      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/halsey/">Halsey</a>‘s most recent social media share shows the singer flaunting her killer figure in a number of NSFW outfits. As those who follow the singer on social media know, Halsey regularly floods her popular page with sexy photos and videos from shoots that she takes part in. In her most recent Instagram share, the beauty gave fans a look at four stunning new snapshots for her spread in <i>Elle Australia</i>.</p>
      <p>The third photo in the series is by far the sexiest with Halsey flaunting her amazing figure for the camera. In photo, the bombshell could be seen putting all of her weight on her feet, kneeling down for the shot and throwing her head back. Her killer body was on full display while clad in a curve-hugging black bodysuit that showed off her tatted arms and legs.</p>
      <p>The singer completed the gorgeous look with a pair of high black heels with white writing. She also rocked a polka dot trench coat that fell off of her shoulders. For the photo op, Halsey wore her short, dark locks slicked back and out of her face while accessorizing the look with a pair of dangly silver earrings. The first image in the series showed the stunner in a tiny blue bralette and matching pants that showcased her taut tummy.</p>

Some of the star’s fans commented on the photo to let the singer know that she looks amazing while countless others dropped a line to let her know that they’re huge fans.</p>
      <p>“Literally your best photo shoot omg. How are you so hot?,” one fan asked, followed by a series of flame emoji.</p>
