      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Monday arraigned one Ibrahim Alhassan Shuaibu before Justice Amina A. Aliyu of a Kano State High Court on a two count charge bordering on misappropriation of funds and issuance of dud cheque.</p>
      <p>Trouble started for the accused person after the Commission received a petition alleging that he diverted $12,000 he received from one Richard Schwartz from the United States of America for the purpose of exchanging same to Naira.</p>
      <p>The petitioner further alleged that after the accused person confirmed the receipt of the money, he (the accused) promised to credit the account of the petitioner with the sum of N4,080,000, which he allegedly failed to honour.</p>
      <p>The accused person, who is a Bureau de Change Operator, allegedly issued the complainant a cheque in the sum of N4,080,000, which bounced on presentation to the bank due to insufficient funds in his account.</p>
      <p>Count one of the charge reads: “That you Ibrahim Alhassan Shuaibu on or about the 29th May, 2017 at Kano within the Jurisdiction of the High Court of Kano State, while entrusted with the sum of 12,000.00 USD for the purpose of exchanging same to naira equivalent dishonestly misappropriated same, and you thereby committed an offense contrary to Section 308 and punishable under section 309 of the Penal Code Law.”</p>
      <p>The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.</p>
      <p>In view of his plea, prosecuting counsel Jonson Ojogbane asked the court for a date for hearing.</p>
      <p>But defence counsel, Hashim Aminu, prayed the court to hear his bail application.</p>
      <p>However, Justice Amina Aliyu refused to consider the bail application on the grounds that the prosecution had not been served.</p>
      <p>Justice Aliyu adjourned the case till  December 2, 2019 for hearing of the motion for bail and commencement of trial.</p>
      <p>The accused person has been remanded in EFCC custody pending the hearing of his bail application.</p>
