      <h1>Martin Shkreli's appeal denied</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:54:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/mark_frauenfelder_1" target="_blank">Mark Frauenfelder</a></address>
      <p>Martin Shkreli, trollish ex-CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, who became infamous in 2015 when he jacked up the price of an HIV medication 5,000%, received some unpleasant news today, reports <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/supreme-court-denies-pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-appeal-request.html?ref=hvper.com&amp;utm_source=hvper.com&amp;utm_medium=website">CNBC</a>. The Supreme Court rejected his request for an appeal of his securities fraud conviction. That means he's going to have to serve the rest of his 7-year sentence and forfeit his $6.4 million fine.</p>
      <p>While his fraud case was pending, Shkreli won the hearts of Trumpsters when he put a bounty on a strand of hair from Hillary Clinton's head. His tweet did not get his desired result, though. Instead, the judge revoked his bail and locked him behind bars for the remainder of the trial.</p>
