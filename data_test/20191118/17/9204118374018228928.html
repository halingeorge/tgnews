      <p>KBR (Houston; <a href="http://www.kbr.com/">www.kbr.com</a>) has been awarded a contract for Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) technology by Shenghong Refining Petrochemical (Lian Yun Gang) Co. Ltd., China. This is the first commercial VAM technology license secured under an alliance agreement between KBR and Showa Denko K.K. (SDK) to commercialize SDK’s VAM technology.</p>
      <p>Under the terms of the contract, KBR will provide License and Basic Engineering Design for a 300 KTA VAM unit to be constructed in Lianyungang, China, as part of an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex.</p>
      <p>The KBR-SDK VAM technology is backed by more than 40 years of know-how accumulated through the safe and stable operation of SDK’s ethylene based VAM unit at the Oita Petrochemical Complex in Japan.</p>
      <p>“We are excited that Shenghong has selected KBR-SDK’s VAM technology,” said Doug Kelly, President, KBR Technology Solutions. “This award consolidates KBR’s position as a licensor of specialty chemicals technologies and strengthens our relationship with a key partner in Shenghong.”</p>
      <p>KBR also provided its phenol/acetone technology to Shenghong in 2019.</p>
