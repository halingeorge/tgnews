      <h1>ESPN pundit reckons Liverpool should sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:15:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-nZDJ49P_M">Craig Burley has told ESPN</a> that he believes Liverpool should sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a short-term deal after the Swedish talisman’s spell at MLS side LA Galaxy came to an end – before ruining Divock Origi.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old was contracted with LA Galaxy until the end of the 2019 MLS season. He scored an enormous 53 goals in 58 games for LA, while also laying on 18 assists for his teammates in that space of time.</p>
      <p>Now a free agent, Ibrahimovic has been linked with a return to Italy after spells with AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus throughout his illustrious career. Fiorentina, Milan and Bologna have been linked with the striker.</p>
      <p>But former Chelsea and Scotland man Burley reckons Liverpool should consider a move for Ibrahimovic on a short-term basis, with Ibrahimovic now on the search for a new club – as Burley claimed Origi is not adequate back-up.</p>

      <p>“I’m not suggesting that this would happen, but we laughed earlier when Jurgen Klopp was asked about him,” Burley said. “I think this is something that could work, short term. I know he doesn’t fit their style, and the pressing.</p>
      <p>“But they literally have nobody else after Roberto Firmino. Please don’t mention Divock Origi. You talk about Liverpool getting over the line for the Premier League, sometimes you just need something different.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking about coming off the bench and bringing something different for 20 or 30 minutes. I really think he could offer something to a team like that for six months. There is not many better that can produce something magical when needed.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Should Liverpool consider a short-term move for Ibra?</h3>
      <p>Ibrahimovic is a completely different player to the kind of style Klopp wants from his squad. However, as Burley says, having a player that can provide the difference when others cannot produce a bit of magic.</p>
      <p>Origi, signed for £10million in 2014 (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28551650">BBC</a>), is excellent back-up to Firmino and also offers cover out wide – despite Burley’s brutal put down. Ibrah would give Liverpool a bit of magic and excitement, but keeping Liverpool’s system fluid is crucial.</p>
      <p>Signing the four-time Serie A winner would force Liverpool to alter the way they play and that should convince Klopp to look elsewhere.</p>
