      <h1>You could win a Galaxy Note 10 in Samsung Malaysia’s latest contest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:34:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author">Mihai M.</a></address>
      <p>Samsung <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/malaysia/">Malaysia</a> has launched a photography contest via Instagram that gives participants a chance to win a <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-note-10/">Galaxy Note 10</a>. Those who want to participate in the <b>#MYSamsungCreation Contest</b> need to send photos that follow a specific theme. The theme for the first week (November 15-21) is <i>Light &amp; Shadows</i> while week 2 (November 22-28) will treat the subject of <i>Little Things to Focus in Life</i>. The final two weeks will explore themes like <i>The Perspective</i> and <i>The Urban Love</i>.</p>
      <p>To join the contest, Samsung fans need to follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samsungmalaysia/?hl=en">Samsung Malaysia on Instagram</a>, take photos based on the weekly theme and submit them using the hashtags <i>#withGalaxy</i> and <i>#MYSamsungCreation</i>, followed by the Galaxy phone model used to capture the photo. They’re also required to tag <i>@SamsungMalaysia</i> and two of their friends in their Instagram submission.</p>
      <h3>Creativity and originality will be rewarded</h3>
      <p>Samsung doesn’t seem to have limited the contest to owners of specific Galaxy smartphone models. Evidently, participants who own handsets with less powerful camera setups would be at a disadvantage if Samsung would focus solely on the quality of photos. However, the company claims that the creativity and originality of submissions will be the main factor determining the judges’ final decision. The grand prize winner of a Galaxy Note 10 with 256GB of storage will be announced on December 20.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Samsung doesn’t mention the Galaxy Note 10+ but uses it as a promotional image for the contest, so it’s not entirely clear which one of the two models will be given as the grand prize. Either way, both variants offer similar specs and deliver great photos. You can check some Galaxy Note 10+ photo samples in <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-note-10-plus/review/">our review</a>.</p>
      <p>As usual, terms and conditions apply so do make sure you read them on the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/my/offer/mobile/mysamsungcreation-contest/">contest page</a> if you wish to join. There’s no limit to how many photos each person can submit, but participants must be residents of Malaysia aged 18 and up.</p>
