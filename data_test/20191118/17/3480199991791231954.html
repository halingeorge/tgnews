      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has paid tribute to a Labour campaigner who died days after describing being left in hospital without treatment for hours.</p>
      <p>Jayne Rae, 53, from Whittle-le-Woods in Lancashire, died on Monday morning after a year with terminal breast cancer.</p>
      <p>In a video first shared by Mr Corbyn on Sunday, Ms Rae told of arriving for hospital treatment to find a scene that “looked like Beirut”.</p>
      <p>“I have never seen people lying in corridors covered in blood, dying, doctors under stress, nurses unable to help to the point of they were crying in frustration.”</p>
      <p>She described tearfully how her mother was “begging” staff to save her life after she spent several hours waiting for treatment in “extreme pain”.</p>

      <p>Following news of her death, Mr Corbyn tweeted: “Incredibly sad to hear that Jayne died this morning. Jayne’s life ended as she lived it: making the world a better place for others.</p>
      <p>“Jayne sent me this video which shows her passion for defending our NHS and making sure it’s there for everyone whenever they need it.”</p>
      <p>Last week, Ms Rae’s daughter posted pictures to Facebook of a bunch of red roses sent by the Labour leader, along with a note reading: “Dear Jayne, thank you for all you do helping others. We will build a world of care for all. With our love and support, Jeremy x.”</p>
      <p>Ms Rae had previously received media attention after holding a “last” birthday party in July to raise money for local community projects.</p>
      <p>RIP Jayne became the top trend on Twitter on Monday afternoon as others paid tribute to the campaigner.</p>
