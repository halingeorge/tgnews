      <h1>Amblin Is Developing an Adaptation of CHESHIRE CROSSING With Characters From WIZARD OF OZ, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, and PETER PAN</h1>

      <p><b>Andy Weir</b>, the writer of the novel <i>The Martian</i>, which the film was based on, has been sitting on a story that he wrote years ago called <b><i>Cheshire Crossing</i></b>. After the success of his novel to film adaptation of <i>The Martian</i>, he created this graphic novel, which includes characters from three classic stories we all know and love. The story brings together Dorothy from <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, </i>Alice of <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i>, and <i>Peter Pan‘s </i>Wendy.</p>
      <p><b>Erin Cressida Wilson</b> (<i>The Girl on the Train</i>) is adapting the screenplay, and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/amblin-michael-de-luca-tackling-martian-author-s-fantasy-graphic-novel-cheshire-crossing-1255011?utm_campaign=THR%27s%20Heat%20Vision_now_2019-11-15%2012%3A42%3A59_acouch&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_heat_vision">THR</a> provides the following synopsis:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>The fantasy mashup tells the story of Dorothy from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Alice of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Peter Pan‘s Wendy, who meet in boarding school for troubled young ladies. They each believe they’ve traveled to a fantastical world but no one else does. When their world-hopping sees Captain Hook and the Wicked Witch of the West team up to combine their magical villainy, the trio must band together to thwart them.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I love a good crossover. Dorothy, Alice, and Wendy were all surrounded by male characters primarily, so it will be interesting to see how they do with some female peers and some new challenges. I think this sounds like a story my whole family could enjoy. Does is sound interesting to you?</p>
