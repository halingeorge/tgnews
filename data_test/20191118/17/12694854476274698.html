        <b>Google Stadia</b>
        <b> is upon us but it has some stiff competition. Microsoft’s </b>
        <b>Project xCloud</b>
        <b> is bearing down on it but </b>
        <b>Nvidia GeForce Now</b>
        <b> can’t be ruled out as a game streaming contender.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Look around everywhere in the gaming world – apart from Sony (sorry, PS Now) – and it seems undeniable that game streaming is set for a massive boom.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is making plenty of plans for its Xbox game streaming service but it has two solid foes in the form of Google’s new Stadia platform and Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-geforce-now-release-date-price-3931873">GeForce Now</a> service. </p>
      <p>The big difference between the two platforms is how you access games. Google Stadia will sell you games directly while GeForce Now allows you to stream games you’ve purchased on storefronts – like Steam, uPlay and Blizzard’s Battle.net. </p>
      <p>So, which is better placed to take on <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/project-xcloud-release-date-specs-price-beta-3941204">Project xCloud</a>? Let’s take a look.</p>

      <h3>Google Stadia vs Nvidia GeForce Now – Release date</h3>
      <p>Google Stadia is out on 19 November while Nvidia GeForce Now is yet to receive a set release date for its launch.</p>
      <p>GeForce Now is currently in public beta. So, you can request a code from Nvidia and fingers crossed you’ll get one and be able to give it a go.</p>
      <p>Regarding a full release date, Nvidia recently said the service for launch “in the coming months.” Nvidia has previously said that it’s “not impossible” that it will also offer a free tier.</p>
