      <p>Prime Minister <b>Boyko Borissov</b> has had a telephone conversation with <b>NATO</b> Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, the government press office reported. "I highly value <b>NATO</b>’s role in protecting our security, freedom and democratic values. For us, <b>Bulgaria</b>'s <b>national security</b> and defence are ensured only within the framework of <b>NATO</b>'s collective defence," Prime Minister Borissov told Stoltenberg.</p>
      <p>The two spoke on the eve of the <b>NATO</b> Summit of Heads of State or Government, which will be held on 3 and 4 December 2019 in London. <b>Bulgaria</b>'s prime minister said that given today's risks and challenges to the international security, this country views the unity of Europe and North America as more important than ever. "For <b>Bulgaria</b>, the transatlantic link is at the heart of our collective defence," said Boyko Borissov.</p>
      <p>In his conversation with Stoltenberg, the prime minister noted that since the beginning of 2018, <b>Bulgaria</b> has successfully been implementing the plans for increasing the defence expenditure until 2024. "With the advance payment of 8 F-16V Block 70 aircraft, this objective has already been achieved, and by the end of 2019, spending is expected to reach 3.1% of GDP,” PM Borissov said. He told Stoltenberg that the country's goals are focused on three main areas - increasing defence spending, modernisation and rearmament, and overcoming the shortage of personnel in the Armed Forces. "<b>Bulgaria</b> will continue to support the Alliance's efforts to achieve global peace and security. We consider our participation in <b>NATO</b> missions and operations a top priority and intend to maintain our commitment and contribution to them,” Borissov said.</p>
