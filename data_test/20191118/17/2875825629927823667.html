      <h3>Dear Coleen</h3>
      <p>I’ve met this really great man and I think the relationship is heading towards living together, and he’s even talked about marriage in the future.</p>
      <p>I’m so happy and we’re in love, but I’m finding it hard to be honest with him about my family background – I suppose because I’m ashamed.</p>
      <p>My dad, who has now passed away, was arrested and put on the Sex Offender Registry some years ago for an assault on a woman. It was terrible at the time – for my mother and our whole family.</p>
      <p>My mum divorced him and I suppose we all buried it and tried to move on together without him. Even now, it’s not something we ever talk about in the family – it’s too painful.</p>
      <p>I’ve never told my partner any of this stuff. He knows my parents divorced and my dad died, and that my mum raised my sister and me on her own for a few years, but that’s it.</p>
      <p>I just don’t know how to talk to him about it. I’m worried as to what he’ll think of me and my family, but I’m also concerned about it raising lots of issues for me again. Can you help?</p>
      <h3>Coleen says</h3>
      <p>I can relate to this in some ways. It’s been well documented there were issues with my own father, which I only discovered later in life. However, I told my first husband, but my second husband Ray already knew about it when we met.</p>
      <p>I don’t think you should worry that it’ll change your partner’s feelings for you – what your dad did doesn’t alter who you are as a person. So, if you want to share this information with him, then I think you should do it and explain why you find it hard to talk about. It is a painful subject and, like you say, raises lots of difficult emotions from all those years ago. If your ­partner’s a good guy, he’ll be nothing but supportive and he’ll understand your reluctance to talk about it.</p>
      <p>I understand you want a clean slate and that you and your family have worked hard to move on, which can’t have been easy and, naturally, you don’t want anything to threaten that.</p>
      <p>However, I think you’re carrying around a lot of shame, which doesn’t belong to you, and there’s a lot left unresolved. If you don’t want to talk about this within your family, then I think you should speak to a therapist about it.</p>
      <p>I had therapy when my first marriage was breaking down and I talked about what had happened within my family. It really helped because although I wasn’t involved in it, I’d swept a lot of confusing feelings under the carpet. It was a huge relief to talk to someone who didn’t judge me.</p>
      <p>I think you’d feel the same and I think you’ll feel enormous relief by confiding in your partner who can put his arm around you and tell you that you don’t have to worry. Good luck.</p>
