      <h4>We asked our contributors how they would spend a 150 million sized Chelsea war chest ahead of Chelsea’s transfer ban appeal.</h4>
      <p>With the appeal for the January window coming soon, it is time to start looking at Chelsea’s next transfer window. <a href="https://theprideoflondon.com/2019/11/18/chelseas-war-chest-part-one-two-top-transfer-targets-blues/"><b>Some of the contributors already gave their targets</b></a> but now it is up to the rest to match those. Using <a href="https://football-observatory.com/"><b>CIES</b></a> and <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/"><b>Transfermarkt</b></a> with a cap of €150 million, our contributors selected their top targets.</p>
      <h3>1. Collect interest – Barrett Rouen</h3>
      <p>Chelsea shouldn’t buy anyone. Things are going well and the players are developing at the right rate.</p>
      <p>The only player I’d buy is Jadon Sancho, but at €150 million that’s not a good enough deal. He’s a damn fine player but we’re talking more than Chelsea got for Eden Hazard or Juventus paid for Cristiano Ronaldo. If they asked for that much money I would politely excuse myself and go to the Alter Markt, St. Reinold’s Church, Westfalenpark and see what other Dortmund things interested me and then head back to London.</p>
      <p>The team is in a good place right now. No need to spend money just for the sake of it. I’m of half a mind to try and do a Chelsea version of Athletic Bilbao and do things properly. If we really think they’re the best at coaching youth players and developing them in the world, then let’s prove it.</p>
      <p>That said I know that’s unrealistic but that also doesn’t mean we need to rock the boat for no reason and just start spending money either. If there’s no good deals save the money and let the team work.</p>
