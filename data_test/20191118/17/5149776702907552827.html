      <h1>'I want it to hurt' - Neal Ardley wants big response from Notts County at Aldershot</h1>
      <h2>Magpies were beaten 3-0 by Barrow at the weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:41:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley says he wants defeat against Barrow to “hurt” his Notts County players as he looks for a strong response when they head to Aldershot this weekend.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> were beaten 3-0 by the league leaders at Meadow Lane at the weekend which was their first defeat at home since losing 2-1 to Barnet in August.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> admitted that his players were off the pace having conceded two goals in the opening 15 minutes and while they have come back from such deficits before, it proved a step too far even for their powers of recovery.</p>
      <p>But the Magpies boss is now hoping his team will hit back with a victory when they travel to lowly Aldershot at the weekend.</p>
      <p>“I gave the players a little bit of perspective after Saturday’s game because you have to keep calm,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are not the best team in the league. If we are one of the best teams then Barrow are the best because they came and outplayed us and outran us.</p>
      <p>“They deserved the victory, but I said to my players that we win as a team, and lose as a team.</p>
      <p>“Not enough of us turned up and I want it to hurt them. I want us to think about how we can respond.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think this group need motivation. But Saturday can go both ways.</p>
      <p>“We have to be careful that a 3-0 defeat doesn’t turn into a 1-0 defeat in the next game.</p>

      <p>“We have to make sure we bounce back.”</p>
      <p>Notts’ task at the weekend has been made tougher after Aldershot were beaten 6-1 by Dagenham at the weekend.</p>
      <p>They will not need to much motivating after suffering such a rout which led their manager Danny Searle to blast his side as a “disgrace”.</p>
      <p>Shots fans then chanted “you’re not fit to wear the shirt” and they will be hoping for a much-improved display against the Magpies this weekend.</p>
      <p>While Ardley has resisted temptation to change his team after defeats this season, he said he offered no guarantees to his players who are currently six points adrift of the summit.</p>
      <p>But he was quick to point out that after a turbulent summer, his side have made great strides this season considering they were only put together just days before the start of the season.</p>
      <p>“I’ve said to them don’t expect to be in the team just because you have been doing well,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We will have a look at where we are by the end of the week.</p>
      <p>“But we have come a long way. I know people will have been angry, but we just have to make sure the comments this weekend are positive.”</p>
