        <b>Beyoncé must be a super proud mum as her daughter Blue Ivy Carter just became an award-winning songwriter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The seven-year-old is already more accomplished than most and it’ sall thanks to her contribution to hit song Brown Skin Girl.</p>
      <p>She accepted the Ashford &amp; Simpson Songwriter’s Award at the Soul Train Awards on Sunday and we all feel like proud parents.</p>
      <p>Beyoncé released Brown Skin Girl on her The Lion King: The Gift album, which celebrates dark and brown-skinned women.</p>
      <p>Blue opens and closes the song – which also features Wizkid and Saint Jhn – with the lyrics: ‘Brown skin girl/ Your skin just like pearls/ The best thing in the world/ Never trade you for anybody else.’</p>
      <p>Blue shares her incredible win with mum Beyoncé and dad Jay-Z.</p>
      <p>Talk about an Ivy League (sorry).</p>

      <p>Grammy nominations will also be revealed on Wednesday and maybe the song could earn the youngster her first Grammy nomination.</p>

      <p>She can put her award next to Beyoncé’s 23 trophies and Jay-Z’s 22.</p>
      <p>Fans were just as excited to hear about Blue winning her first-ever award.</p>
      <p>A fan took to Twitter and posted: ‘Blue ivy carter is an award-winning, hot-100 charting, hitmaking freestyle rapper, songwriter, vocalist, and choreographer. at age seven. an icon.’</p>
      <p>‘SO YALL TELLING ME THAT BLUE IVY CARTER IS AN AWARD WINNING ARTIST NOW!!?? WHO ELSE IS 7 AND DOING IT LIKE HER…NO ONE,’ another tweeted.</p>
      <p>Blue Ivy is probably at home casually filing her nails because this is just another success she has already achieved.</p>
      <p>In July, she landed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the fist time when Brown Skin Girl debuted at 76.</p>
      <p>On the Billboard Top 200 chart, the album peaked at number two.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but she also co-starred with her mother in the music video for Spirit.</p>
      <p>2020 hasn’t even started and Blue Ivy’s already won.</p>
