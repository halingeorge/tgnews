      <h1>House to vote on funding stopgap on Tuesday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:28:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/niv-elis" target="_blank">Niv Elis</a></address>
      <p>The House is set to vote Tuesday on a funding stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown, pushing the deadline for an agreement from Nov. 21 to Dec. 20.</p>
      <p>The continuing resolution (CR) comes as lawmakers continue to battle over the parameters for new spending bills, with the largest controversies centered around <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>'s proposed border wall.</p>
      <p>Top appropriators are negotiating over how to allocate funds among 12 spending bills, aiming to strike a deal by Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The CR would allow them to put off final decisions about how to deal with the wall, an issue many lawmakers <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/470735-lawmakers-skeptical-of-progress-on-spending-deal-as-wall-battle-looms">believe</a> will drag out the funding talks and require yet another stopgap into the new year.</p>
      <p>Democrats are expected to post the text of the continuing resolution and bring it to the House Rules Committee Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Some conservative groups, such as Club for Growth, have already decried the Christmas deadline as harmful to Trump's negotiating position.</p>
      <p>"Why in the world would @realDonaldTrump allow Congress to corner him toward a potential Christmas Shutdown? #VETO" the group's vice president of government affairs, Scott Parkinson, tweeted Monday.</p>

      <p>A presidential veto of the CR would likely lead to a shutdown.</p>
      <p>Last year, a 35-day shutdown began when Trump threatened to veto a CR over wall funding just ahead of Christmas.</p>
