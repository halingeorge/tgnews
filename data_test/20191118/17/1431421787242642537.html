      <h1>Israel Soccer: Inter Aliyah Blanks Elitzur Yehud to Stay in the Hunt</h1>
      <h2>The win puts the all-olim team in joint fifth place in the league table, four points behind leading Hapoel Ramat Israel</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:04:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968695" target="_blank">Haaretz Sports Staff</a></address>
      <p>Inter Aliyah returned to its winning ways last Friday, easily disposing of Elitzur Yehud 3-0 in an away game.</p>
      <p>Following last week’s disappointing draw at home, Inter was intent on returning to Tel Aviv with no fewer than three points. The team played in such a manner, controlling the game from the start. The opener came through striker Evyatar Erez, who beat the offside trap to give the visitors a deserved lead going into halftime.</p>

      <p>After the break, Inter’s relentless pressure paid off and the all-important two-goal cushion was secured by Erez, who clinched a brace, this time with his right. Yehud barely threatened Tal Amar in the Inter goal and the points were confirmed thanks to a delightful long-range strike from Ariel Peretz.</p>
      <p>The win puts Inter in joint fifth place in the table, four points behind league-leading Hapoel Ramat Israel.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night, Inter’s B team lost 4-1 to the best team in the International Football League. Still, they came home feeling extremely proud of themselves despite the defeat.</p>
      <p>Estudiantes, which has dropped two points the entire season, seemed somewhat surprised by the rearguard action that Matt Keston’s men put forward and chances were limited to both sides. Despite what seemed a clear foul on Alan Kaler, Estudiantes broke the deadlock before halftime to go into the break ahead.</p>
      <p>The all-olim team continued in the manner that it began in the second half and the players matched their opponents in every aspect of the game. However, a second goal broke their resolve and two more quickly followed as Estudiantes saw the game out. There was still time for Tal Zraya to volley home a Dani Mizrachi corner but the league leaders claim the victory, albeit a generous one.</p>
