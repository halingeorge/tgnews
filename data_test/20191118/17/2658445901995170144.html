      <p>The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Monday said that former President Goodluck Jonathan was delighted with the outcome of the November 16 governorship elections in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>While Jonathan is a member of the Peoples Democratic, PDP, the APC Governorship candidate in the election, David Lyon was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC as he defeated the candidate of the PDP, Senator Diri Douye.</p>
      <p>Speaking with State House correspondents after the presentation of the Governor-Elect, David Lyon to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Chairman of the APC Governors Forum and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu said that former President Jonathan was happy with the outcome of the election.</p>
      <p>He said, “We were in Bayelsa for over 72 hours, we didn’t see a tire burning, we didn’t see people running, we didn’t hear any gunshot and everyone was celebrating in all the areas we passed since yesterday (Sunday) which shows acceptance of the candidate of our party of the process itself.</p>

      <p>“It is equally noteworthy that Bayelsa is a state which is home to a former President of Nigeria and this election won by a party different from which he belongs to has been accepted by all including people around him.</p>
      <p>“So far, from what we hear and what we see, he is also happy with the outcome irrespective of the difference in the party which is an indication of the transparency of the process. “he said</p>
      <p>The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Silver said that the election of an APC governor in Bayelsa State was very significant as it is a footprint for the party in the Niger Delta region.</p>
      <p>According to him, the outgoing governor, Seriake Dickson made the victory easier for the APC.</p>
      <p>He said “From here we shall grow the party in the South-South and South East.”</p>
