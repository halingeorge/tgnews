      <p>Kathleen Turner has revealed she would turn down the role of playing Chandler’s transgender parent if she was asked today.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old actress, who does not identify as transgender, revealed she originally said yes to the acting opportunity because she ‘hadn’t done that’ before.</p>
      <p>A caller into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy6D16zE_mMEm1HVD20WFxA">Andy Cohen’s Watch What Happens Live</a> show asked Kathleen: ‘How much did [you] love playing Chandler’s father on Friends?’</p>
      <p>Andy Cohen jumped in and remarked: ‘That was really groundbreaking!’</p>

      <p>She laughed and responded: ‘Well, yes – and of course, I wouldn’t do it now because there would be real people able to do it.’</p>

      <p>While she did not elaborate on this point, perhaps she wouldn’t do it because fans of the show have since slammed it for it’s portrayal of transgender people.</p>
      <p>Throughout the series, Chandler regularly makes his transgender mother the butt of his jokes.</p>
      <p>This included constantly referring to her name before her transition (a concept known as deadnaming), refusing to recognise her gender identity and even dry-wretching when he sees her perform as a drag queen on stage.</p>
      <p>(There’s also a horribly transphobic line said by Chandler’s mother: ‘Don’t you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?’)</p>

      <p>In fact, Kathleen previously revealed to <a href="https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/129649/kathleen-turner-says-she-would-now-refuse-role-of-trans-parent-on-friends/">Gay Times</a> that the show ‘didn’t age well’.</p>
      <p>While Friends is hilarious in parts, there’s certainly no mistaking it failed some of its LGBTQ+ characters.</p>
      <p>During the Andy Cohen interview, Kathleen also explained how she came to play the Friends role.</p>
      <p>She revealed: ‘One of the co-creators of Friends – I was doing a one-woman show based on Tallulah Bankhead – and he came up to see the show in San Francisco and came backstage and said “You have to play Chandler’s dad”.’</p>
      <p>‘And I thought “OK, a woman playing a man playing a woman. I haven’t done that”. So I said yes,’ she added.</p>
      <p>Well, thank you for saying no this time around.</p>
