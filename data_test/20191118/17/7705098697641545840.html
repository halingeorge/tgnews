      <h1>Despite Star Support, No Warner Bros. Plans for Justice League’s Snyder Cut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:19:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>The people have spoken, yet it seems that Warner Bros. is turning a deaf ear. Once more, 2017’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/justice-league"><b>Justice League</b></a> and the supposed Zack Snyder director’s cut is the talk of social media. This time, <b>Justice League </b>star Gal Gadot lit a fuse by asking on Twitter for the release of the Snyder Cut and sharing a previously unseen black-and-white image of Diana. Gadot partly followed Snyder’s lead, as the filmmaker shared several black-and-white images from his version of <b>Justice League</b> on his socials</p>

      <p>Both <b>Justice League </b>co-stars <a href="https://twitter.com/rehsifyar/status/1196172064899653638">Ray Fisher</a> and Ben Affleck jumped in and joined Gadot in her request, calling for the Snyder Cut. According to a report by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/snyder-cut-ben-affleck-gal-gadot-call-new-justice-league-release-1255582">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, though, “no announcement of a release of any such cut is imminent.” The actors’ recent requests are just the tip of the iceberg, as DCEU fans have been vocal for a long time about the Snyder Cut.</p>

      <p>Shortly thereafter, Zack Snyder himself retweeted Gal Gadot’s request, stating that “this ancient Amazonian can’t be wrong.”</p>

      <p>The request for the Snyder Cut started after Warner Bros. called Joss Whedon in to finish <b>Justice League</b> after Zack Snyder stepped down due to some serious family issues. The movie took a different direction with reshoots. Whedon and the studio changed the original plans and wrote new scenes. Eventually, the movie received mixed reactions from fans and critics alike, and many think that it underperformed at the box-office. Warner Bros. are more likely to reboot completely than release an unfinished alternate version.</p>
