      <h3>Curvy Model Ashley Alexiss Rocks Lacy Underwear As She Shows Support For The Patriots</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/ashley-alexiss/">Ashley Alexiss</a> shared a photo to her Instagram fans to show off her support for the New England Patriots in her underwear, and her fans are going wild for it. On Sunday, the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit model took to the popular social media platform to post a sweltering snapshot in which she rocks a football jersey and a pair of lacy lingerie that puts her famous curves fully on display.</p>
      <p>The photo shows Alexiss standing in front of a white back drop as she faced the camera. The model wore a figure-hugging navy jersey with the number 11 on the front. Alexiss is tugging at the bottom of the jersey as she pulls it to the side, revealing her stomach and bellybutton piercing along the way.</p>
      <p>Alexiss teamed her top with a pair of lace underwear featuring Pat Patriot on the front. In addition to her favorite team’s mascot, the lingerie also displays the Pats’ blue and white colors. The bottoms have a lace waistband that sits high on the model’s side, helping showcase her full lower body.</p>
      <p>Alexiss is shooting a fierce gaze at the camera with her lips slightly puckered into a smile. Her dirty blonde hair is in a middle part and styled down. Her hair is blowing back, as if by a fan.</p>

      <p>She completed her look with expressive makeup marked by a dark smokey eye and light pink shade on her lips.</p>
      <p>Since going live, the post — which Alexiss shared with her almost 2 million Instagram followers — has garnered more than 24,700 likes in under a day of being posted, as of the time of this writing. The same time period also brought in upwards of 300 comments to the photo.</p>
      <p>Users of the social media app who are fans of the swimsuit model took to the comments section to praise the photo, while also showering her with compliments and emoji.</p>
      <p>Loading...</p>
      <p>“Can I say “Yay” and “Boo” at the same time?” one user wrote.</p>
      <p>“Beautiful and wearing a winning shirt [thumbs up emoji] GO PAT’S,” said another fan, finishing the comment off with a flexed bicep emoji.</p>
      <p>“I am in love!!!! GO PATS!!!!” a third fan raved.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Alexiss strips down to her lingerie in recent posts. As <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5745503/ashley-alexiss-bra/">The Inquisitr</a></i> has previously written, Alexiss took to her Instagram page just a few days ago to share a snapshot in which she rocked nothing but a lilac bra that left little to the imagination.</p>
