        <b>A man who went into the same shop six times on the same day has been cleared of allegations he knowingly used forged £20 notes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nathan Lee Hennedy, 24, of Ashtrees Way, Carnforth, near Lancaster, was found not guilty of purposely passing £20 notes as genuine in a string of transactions at the Bargain Booze on Wentworth Drive, Lancaster, on August 1 last year.</p>

      <p>In a statement, the store manager said on August 2, 2018, she cashed up the tills and two £20 notes were fake. She then found £60 more in the safe and others in the other till.</p>
      <p>CCTV showed Mr Hennedy was in the store six times during the evening. He had also bought a bottle of cider for £4.99 and paid with a £20, and later a bottle of Fanta, also paid for with a £20 note.</p>
      <p>The defendant had later returned other items for a refund.</p>
      <p>Nina Woodward, an expert for the Bank of England, gave a statement confirming all eight notes had the same serial number.</p>
      <p>The bench ruled they could not be sure the defendant’s actions were dishonest and he was cleared.</p>
