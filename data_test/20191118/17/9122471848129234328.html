      <h1>Paul Finebaum On If Nick Saban Is To Blame For Tua Tagovailoa’s Injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:56:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Nick Saban is being put through the wringer for the decision to keep Tua Tagovailoa in the game against Mississippi State on Saturday. The Crimson Tide held a 28-point lead when the star quarterback suffered the injury.</p>
      <p>As a result, many are questioning Saban’s decision to keep Tagovailoa in the game. Some are even blaming Alabama’s head coach for the whole ordeal.</p>
      <p>Is Saban to blame? SEC Network’s Paul Finebaum discussed that very question on Monday morning.</p>
      <blockquote>“It is so easy to blame but in some ways it’s also reckless just to start blaming someone when these things … no one wanted any of this to happen,” Finebaum said on WJOX radio, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Tua-Tagovailoa-injury-blame-game-with-Paul-Finebaum-Alabama-Crimson-Tide-football-138802210/">247Sports</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>Saban’s an easy target to pile on the blame for Tagovailoa’s horrific injury. But the way the current playoff system is formatted, style points matter more now than ever. The Alabama head coach may have felt pressure to impress the playoff committee.</p>
      <blockquote>“The reason that I think we were where we were on Saturday is because of the absurd nature of how we select college football teams to play in this tournament …  What does <b><a href="https://247sports.com/Coach/Nick-Saban-3">Nick Saban</a></b> and Alabama have to do? They have to go out there and put on a show,” Finebaum said. “They have to run it up … I’m not playing the blame game. I’m just telling you the reality.”</blockquote>
      <p>Is the playoff system more to blame than Saban for this incident? Perhaps a different postseason format could help prevent situations like this.</p>
      <p>Either way, Saban’s going to be under some heat for the rest of the season. With Tagovailoa out for the season, backup QB Mac Jones will take over the offense.</p>
      <p>Alabama gets back on the field this Saturday against Western Carolina.</p>
