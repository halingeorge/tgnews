      <p>Deyjah Harris, daughter of T.I., has now deleted her Instagram account following comments her father made about her sexual health.</p>
      <p>As of Sunday 17 November, Deyjah’s account, @princess_of_da_south, was completely deactivated.</p>
      <p>Deyjah, who is known from reality series <i>Tiny &amp; T.I.: Family Hustle</i> made the move right after she unfollowed her dad on Twitter and Instagram.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old has made the move to come off of social media completely after what T.I. said about her.</p>
      <p>On the Ladies Like Us ‘Life Hacks’ podcast last week, T.I. spoke openly about ensuring Deyjah’s hymen was intact.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Deyjah’s 18, just graduated high school now and she’s attending her first year of college, figuring it out for herself.</p>
      <p>‘And yes, not only have we had the conversation, we have yearly trips to the gynecologist to check her hymen.’</p>

      <p>People began reacting to what T.I. came out with immediately, many comments standing up for Deyjah.</p>

      <p>Even celebs got involved, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/iggy-azalea-claims-t-i-needs-therapy-as-hes-slammed-for-keeping-check-on-daughters-virginity-11062235/">rapper Iggy Azalea speaking out</a> to say T.I. ‘has serious control issues with women in all aspects of his life and needs therapy’.</p>
      <p>In now deleted tweets, Iggy wrote: ‘Unfortunately, he is dead serious. I really wish the women who interviewed him would have said something to him.’</p>
      <p>And while Deyjah hasn’t said anything officially, it’s highly likely that she’s quite upset by her father’s choice to share something so private with the world.</p>

      <p>Plus her decisions to unfollow him on social channels and then delete her Instagram account speak for themselves.</p>
      <p>Deyjah’s step mother, Tiny, responded to comments from people asking if Deyjah is ok, especially with all the public attention she’s now getting.</p>
      <p>Tiny just replied with an eye roll emoji.</p>
      <p>Kind of confusing but this may mean she has chosen to side with her husband this time.</p>
      <p>Or maybe she just doesn’t want to be involved in the whole drama.</p>
