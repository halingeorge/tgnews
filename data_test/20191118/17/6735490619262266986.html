      <p>Lady Antebellum has finally collaborated with Little Big Town, which only took five years.</p>
      <p>The country trio, made up of Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, chatted with <a href="http://www.cmt.com/news/1814806/lady-antebellum-feel-the-emotions-of-ocean/"><i>CMT</i></a> and spilled on how the epic collab, “The Thing That Wrecks You”, finally came about.</p>

      <p>“Collaborating with LBT, that has been something we’ve been talking about doing with them for the last, I would say, five years,” Kelley explained. “Every time we’re in a late-night having a glass of wine together, we’re like, ‘We should work together. I mean, how cool would that be? Seven voices on one song!'”</p>
      <p>He continued, “I kind of put them on the spot. I said, ‘Y’all, I’ve got two songs I really want you to hear.’ And they really fell in love with ‘The Thing That Wrecks You.’ I’m so proud of how it came out. It was a master class in vocals, wasn’t it?”</p>
      <p>And when they got in the recording booth, Scott says everything just fell together.</p>

      <p>“There’s so much non-verbal understanding, it’s amazing,” she said before Kelley added, “They know exactly where their parts should be. It’s really cool.”</p>
      <p>He added, “We feel that way to a point, too, being together for 13 years. But watching four voices and four-part harmony, it was like going to school.”</p>
      <p>“The Thing That Wrecks You” appears on Lady A’s new album <i>Ocean</i>, available now.</p>
