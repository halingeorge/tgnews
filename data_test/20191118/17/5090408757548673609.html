        <li>They have a simple yet distinctive design, come in a variety of colors and finishes, and are made with sustainable and flexible rubber.</li>
        <li>We tested three pairs of Hunter boots on the rainy streets of New York City and approve of them overall for their comfort, light weight, and functionality. Keep scrolling for our full review below.</li>

Come gentle sprinkles or torrential downpours, you can expect to see a few pairs of these short and tall boots splashing through streets, no matter where you are.</p>
      <p>The funny thing about Hunter’s rubber <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-rain-boots-women">rain boots</a> is that they have quite a simple design, yet they’re still so recognizable and iconic. An easy way to differentiate them from other brands is the Hunter label at the front opening of the boot, or by their rich color and glossy finish.</p>

      <p>The classic boots have a rich history, going back to 1856. In Scotland, an American named Henry Lee Norris founded the North British Rubber Company (which later became Hunter) and made boots using a new patented process that created more durable rubber products. During both World Wars, the company was commissioned to create boots for soldiers.</p>
      <p>In 1955, Hunter created the Original Green Wellington, otherwise known as the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=1237&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fhunter-original-tall-waterproof-rain-boot-women%2F3348252%2Ffull">Original Tall Boot</a>. The versatile, comfortable, and durable handcrafted style is still the brand’s most popular shoe.</p>
      <p>Other than the Original Tall Boots, Hunter now makes a variety of boot styles for men, women, and children. It has also expanded into outerwear and bags.</p>

      <p>Before it’s too late and you’re stuck wading through puddles with wet socks, get a pair of Hunter boots. They’re made from natural latex rubber that’s flexible and waterproof – and <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hunterboots.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fdiscover%2Fsustainability-product">sourced from sustainable and ethical plantations</a> in China and Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Another reason to shop with the company is that it recycles old boots in the UK and donates fully functional boots to local nonprofits, particularly those that help victims of political conflict or natural disasters.</p>
      <p>You can find Hunter boots at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=1237&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.nordstrom.com%2Fbrands%2Fhunter--5350%3Forigin%3DproductBrandLink">Nordstrom</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2KooiSw">Amazon</a>, as well as the <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hunterboots.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2F">Hunter website</a>.

      <h4>We tried 3 different pairs of Hunter boots. Here’s what we thought:</h4>
      <h3>1. A pair of adjustable, fashion-forward rain boots</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>These slick black boots are the perfect look for a rainy day, and I appreciate that they have fewer rubber layers so they feel particularly lightweight. They do the simple job of keeping my feet dry, and the adjustable strap at the top can be tightened for added protection against serious downpours.</p>
      <p>But they’re not the most comfortable to wear. I got my standard size (9), and my heel rubs up against the back of the shoes while I walk. I’d consider sizing up, especially if you plan to wear them with socks thicker than your everyday pair, but Hunter currently only offers full sizes. If you’re an 8.5 or even an 8, these may be the perfect fit for you. For me, I’ll probably stick to my <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/everlane-women-rain-boots-review">Everlane rain boots</a> – despite how much heavier they are. <b>-Mara Leighton, Insider Picks reporter</b></p>
      <h3>2. A pair of classic canary yellow boots</h3>

      <p>When all the dreary days of winter seem to blend together, sometimes all you need is a pop of color to brighten your day. At least, that was my reasoning behind choosing these yellow boots that would also help me stand out from a pack of black-clad New Yorkers.</p>
      <p>The color, durability, and comfort of the boots make me instantly excited to trek through the rain, even though this California girl generally hates any precipitation. They feel sturdy, but they’re not too heavy, and the outsole has a secure tread.</p>
      <p>You should be fine with your usual size. I found while wearing my normal socks that there was a good amount of wiggle room, so once weather conditions really become dire, you’ll be able to wear thick socks to stay warm. If you have thick calves, you should consider these shorter boots versus Hunter’s classic tall style. Tall boots can sometimes be difficult for me to take off, but I could put on and take off the pair above easily without worrying about being stuck in them. <b>-Connie Chen, Insider Picks senior reporter</b></p>
      <h3>3. A pair of insulated boots to keep your legs really warm</h3>

      <p>As far as warmth goes, these boots are all you need for a cold, wet day. I put a pair of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shearling-insoles-review">shearling insoles</a> in mine for added softness and warmth around my toes, but the faux-shearling liner keeps my legs perfectly cozy.</p>
      <p>As for fit, I had a bit of trouble with these boots. Hunter’s normal-width tall boots don’t fit over my slightly muscular calves so I opted for the wide-leg version, which fit my calves with room to spare. What I didn’t realize was that the footbed is also wide. If your feet aren’t particularly wide but you have muscular calves, I recommend sizing down to solve this problem, especially if you’re a half-size like me. My workaround to the shoes being slightly large is that I added the shearling insoles and I mostly wear these with jeans or thick socks underneath so they stay secure.</p>
      <p>If your calves and feet are both wide, you should be fine with your normal size.</p>
      <p>Another thing to note if you’re short like me is that the rim of the boots may hit the back of your thigh a bit as you go up and down the stairs. I’m a little over 5 feet tall, and this is an issue I have with any stiff knee-high boots, but if you’re any taller than 5-foot-3-inches, you should be fine. Overall, these are a really warm upgrade to Hunter’s OG tall boots – as long as you get your sizing right. <b>-Sally Kaplan, Insider Picks editor</b></p>
