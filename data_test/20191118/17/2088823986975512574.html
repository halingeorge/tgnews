      <p>Middle linebacker Tremaine Edmunds was a weapon of Miami destruction in Sunday’s victory over the Dolphins.</p>
      <p>The Bills’ second-year middle linebacker tied a career high with 12 tackles, was in on a sack, had a superb fourth-down pass breakup and put two other hits on Miami quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he was unleashed as a blitzer to the greatest degree we’ve seen yet by defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier.</p>
      <p>Edmunds was sent as a rusher at Fitzpatrick on 12 snaps. Those included three sacks, two incompletions (one on a hurry by Edmunds), a holding penalty on the Dolphins and five completions for 54 yards.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s doing a lot for us on defense, getting a lot of guys free, giving the offense a different look they may have not seen,” Edmunds said on the coaches using him as a blitzer. “We do a good job across the board. (The blitzes) wouldn’t be successful if the other guys didn’t do their job as well. We executed pretty well.”</p>
      <p>Edmunds’ good plays started early. On Miami’s second drive, he came free up the middle on an A-gap blitz past the center, which allowed defensive tackle Ed Oliver to be unblocked and get a 5-yard sack of Fitzpatrick.</p>
      <p>That was one of six plays on which both Edmunds and linebacker Matt Milano both blitzed as part of six- or seven-man pressures.</p>
      <p>In the third quarter, Edmunds showed his speed by chasing down a wide-receiver screen, holding it to a 5-yard gain on a second-and-20 play.</p>
      <p>On the next play, he and Milano both blitzed and combined on a 7-yard sack.</p>
      <p>Another “cross-dog blitz” (with Edmunds and Milano twisting on a rush) on Miami’s next series flushed Fitzpatrick into the arms of Star Lotulelei for a 3-yard sack.</p>

      <p>On the next play, the 6-foot-5, 250-pound Edmunds crushed pass-protecting running back Patrick Laird on a blitz to force an incompletion by Fitzpatrick.</p>
      <p>“Tremaine is a true leader,” said defensive tackle Jordan Phillips. “He not only says it, he goes out and does it.”</p>
      <p>Edmunds’ best pass-defense play came on a fourth-and-16 play in the fourth quarter when he dropped 25 yards downfield to the deep middle in a Tampa-2 coverage and broke up a throw for tight end Mike Gesicki.</p>

      <p>The Bills’ coaches didn’t show much fear of the Miami offense. Frazier blitzed on 18 of 56 dropbacks (32%). Normally, the Bills blitz at about 18% to 20%. But the Dolphins are depleted at receiver, offensive line and running back. It would be a surprise if Frazier blitzed that much against more potent offenses on the horizon for the defense – such as Dallas or Baltimore.</p>
      <p>The Bills had five of their seven sacks on blitzes. Fitzpatrick was just 6 of 11 for 44 yards when the Bills rushed five or more.</p>
