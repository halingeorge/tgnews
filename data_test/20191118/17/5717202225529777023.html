      <p>Everton defender Djibril Sidibe has heaped praised on his teammate Bernard, describing him as an example for all to follow.</p>
      <p>The star, on loan from AS Monaco, is grateful towards the Brazilian for inspiring him to grab his opportunity when it arrived.</p>
      <p>Sidibe had to bide his time at Goodison Park at first, but is now seemingly a regular having started the last four Premier League games.</p>

      <p>The World Cup winner is already a popular figure with the fans, and looks set for a run in the team now ahead of Seamus Coleman at right-back.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Bernard, <a href="https://www.evertonfc.com/news/1496622/sidibe-identifies-teammate-who-inspired-his-flying-everton-start">Sidibe told the club’s official website</a>: “The biggest difference in England is your state of mind, how you go into a game mentally.</p>
      <p>“Look at Bernard. He is tiny but look at him, the intensity he puts into a game, his runs forward and back. His tackling and his gestures on the field. Everything. He is all action. He is an example we can all follow.</p>
      <p>“Skill and ability and size are important. But your mental approach is very important, too; the fact you go 100 per cent all out for every challenge, in attack or defence.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Plucky Bernard a good example</h3>
      <p>Bernard is a great player and is the type to lead by example through performance.</p>

      <p>It would be very easily for someone like him to crumble in the Premier League, with the English top-flight known for its intensity and physicality.</p>
      <p>But despite his slight 5ft 5in frame, Bernard doesn’t allow himself to be pushed around and is admirably tenacious for the Toffees.</p>
      <p>He’s at a physical disadvantage to most other players, but he doesn’t let that count for anything and clearly that earns him the respect of his teammates.</p>
