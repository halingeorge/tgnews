      <p>Tile made its long-awaited debut in India earlier this year with the Tile Mate, and the brand is now <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiles-new-trackers-go-further-and-longer-and-they-stick-things">launching its latest products</a> in the country. The Tile Sticker, Tile Pro, and Tile Slim are all <a href="https://www.amazon.in/stores/node/7136568031?tag=mbnx00-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82527YYw">available on Amazon India</a>, with the new trackers offering extended range and more features.</p>
      <p>As its name suggests, the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/TILE-RE-25002-AP-Tile-Sticker-Pack/dp/B07YDG2PQZ?tag=mbnx00-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82527YYw">Tile Sticker</a> has a 3M adhesive that sticks to "virtually anything." It is Tile's smallest tracker to date, and has a built-in battery that lasts for three years. You also get a range of 150 feet, making it ideal for attaching to outdoor gear or cameras.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.in/TILE-RE-23001-AP-Tile-Slim-Pack/dp/B07YDFC527?tag=mbnx00-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82527YYw">Tile Slim</a> looks like a credit card, and the low profile allows it to be tucked into wallets, passport holders, or luggage tags. It also has a battery that lasts three years, and Tile says it is twice as loud as the previous-gen Slim. It has a range of 200 feet.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiles-new-trackers-go-further-and-longer-and-they-stick-things">Tile's new trackers go further and last longer — and they stick to things</a>
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Tile-Pro-Replaceable-Battery-Pack/dp/B07GLXY253/?tag=mbnx00-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82527YYw">Tile Pro</a> is the most powerful Bluetooth tracker available in the market today, with a Bluetooth range of 400 feet. The design is similar to the standard Tile Mate, but you get a ruggedized body. The Tile Pro runs off of a standard CR2032 battery, and you'll have to switch out the battery once a year.</p>
      <p>So how much will you be shelling out for the new Tile trackers? Here's the full breakdown:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.in/TILE-RE-25002-AP-Tile-Sticker-Pack/dp/B07YDG2PQZ?tag=mbnx00-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82527YYw">Tile Sticker</a>: ₹3,999 (2-pack)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.in/TILE-RE-23001-AP-Tile-Slim-Pack/dp/B07YDFC527?tag=mbnx00-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82527YYw">Tile Slim</a>: ₹2,999</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.in/Tile-Pro-Replaceable-Battery-Pack/dp/B07GLXY253/?tag=mbnx00-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82527YYw">Tile Pro</a>: ₹3,999</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Tile Sticker and Tile Slim are waterproof, and the Tile Pro is water-resistant. The Indian pricing is more than what you'd pay for the trackers in the U.S., but the fact that you can buy Tile directly in India is a win on its own. Do note that you'll need to subscribe to Tile Premium to get alerts on your phone, and that's an additional ₹2,300 a year.</p>
