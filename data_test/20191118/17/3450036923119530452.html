      <p>KIRKSVILLE, Mo. â€” Karen Armstrong has always seemed to have a beat on anything environmental science-related.</p>
      <p>Armstrong is currently the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) Environmental Educator a position that she has served in for the past nineteen years.</p>
      <p>Prior to working for the MDC, Armstrong was an environmental science teacher at Kirksville High School for 7 years.</p>
      <p>Armstrong has had an interest in environmental science ever since her time as a student-teacher at Fairfield, Iowa middle school.</p>
      <p>As a student teacher at Fairfield middle school, Armstrong developed a curriculum for the Environmental Science class that she taught at Kirksville High School.</p>
      <p>Even today at her job at the MDC, Armstrong continues to demonstrate contributions to environmental education by helping children connect with nature and help them develop a healthy respect for the world they live in.</p>
      <p>Armstrong has done a lot for the environmental science field which is why she was chosen for the Outstanding Lifetime Environmental Education Service Award.</p>
      <p>KTVO spoke with Armstrong Monday to get her thoughts on how she feels about receiving this award.</p>
      <blockquote>"I've been involved with the Missouri Environmental Education Association for almost since its inception and as when I was a teacher at the high school here in Kirksville. And then when I started working for the Department of Conservation I appreciated the opportunity to be able to share nature and the environment with children and so this is a culmination for me I would say," Armstrong said.</blockquote>
      <p>Everyone at KTVO would like to send their sincere congratulations for to Karen Armstrong receiving this much-earned award.</p>
