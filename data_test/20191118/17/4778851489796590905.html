        <b>Former Prime Minister Theresa May has said that voting Tory is the only way to stop a second independence referendum as she hit the election campaign trail in Stirling.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ex-Tory leader hit the doorsteps with Tory candidate in the city Stephen Kerr who is defending a wafer thin majority of 148 from the SNP.</p>
      <p>Mrs May told STV news: "I've two reasons why the Conservatives can keep Stirling.</p>
      <p>"Firstly because Stephen Kerr is a fantastic member of Parliament - a really strong voice for Stirling and for Scotland in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>"And second, because if you are Unionist and you want to want to stop indyref2, there's only one vote and that's Conservative."</p>

          <b>Brexit Party withdraws support from Glenrothes candidate</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>The former Tory leader, who is standing again to be an MP in the election, said she was enjoying being on the campaign with Scottish colleagues.</p>
      <p>Kerr's closest challenge is likely to come from the current Nationalist MEP Alyn Smith.</p>
