      <p>WASHINGTON (CN) – As President Donald Trump prepares to ask the Supreme Court to block a subpoena for his financial records, the House Oversight Committee told the justices Monday it would agree to a short stay of an appeals court decision that found the subpoena valid.</p>
      <p>The D.C. Circuit last week declined to rehear Trump’s challenge to the subpoena, which the House Oversight Committee sent to the president’s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA asking for eight years of his personal financial records. That decision left standing a 2-1 ruling from October that upheld the subpoena.</p>
      <p>Trump’s private attorneys on Friday <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/trump-asks-justices-to-halt-release-of-financial-records/">filed an application</a> with the Supreme Court asking the justices to delay the D.C. Circuit’s ruling from going into effect until the high court decides whether to hear the case. Without a stay, the committee could enforce the subpoena on Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>In a two-page <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/house-letter-mazars.pdf">letter</a> filed with the Supreme Court on Monday, the House Oversight Committee said it would not object to an administrative stay through Nov. 30 that would allow for further briefing in the case. The committee plans to file its brief opposing Trump’s request for a longer stay by Friday.</p>
      <p>“Out of courtesy to this court, the committee does not, however, oppose a short ten-day administrative stay, beginning on November 20, 2019, to enable the court to receive an opposition by the committee and then rule on the Trump applicants’ request for a stay pending certiorari,” the committee’s letter to the court states.</p>
      <p>The filing from the committee is the first action on a pair of Trump appeals that made their way to the Supreme Court last week.</p>
      <p>In addition to the fight with the House Oversight Committee, Trump last week also asked the Supreme Court to hear a challenge to a subpoena the Manhattan District Attorney’s office served on Mazars seeking the same set of documents.</p>
      <p>Trump has argued that as president, he is immune from having to turn over his personal financial records in a criminal matter and that the House’s subpoena is invalid because it does not serve a legislative purpose.</p>
