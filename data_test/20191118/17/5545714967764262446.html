      <h1>Here's the PS5 controller, complete with a big ol' touchpad</h1>
      <h2>Our first look at the DualShock 5 comes from a patent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Devore</a></address>
      <p>A newly-surfaced <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/DE/JP-2019-005960/0A493D7BB9C01BA4712B57A8318A7208A68420EF54F725A2D4AC928C7B752081/30/ja">Sony patent</a> has given us our kinda-sorta first glimpse of the PlayStation 5 controller. Even with a side-by-side comparison, you'd be forgiven for mixing it up with the PS4's DualShock 4.</p>

      <p>The new design retains the same overall form factor as before, and one of the DualShock 4's most contentious features – the big honking touchpad – has made the cut for the DualShock 5. Is the touchpad super underutilized in most PS4 games? Yes. Is it fun to mash? Yes. A hundred percent yes.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, the light bar – the bit at the top of your PS4 pad that glows while you're gaming and is also used for motion tracking with PlayStation VR – is seemingly out of the picture. That's a curious removal given that the PlayStation 5 is said to be compatible with the current crop of PSVR games.</p>
      <p>Considering what we know about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../sony-confirms-the-ps5-is-a-physical-backward-compatible-console-will-ship-with-a-solid-state-drive-to-drastically-cut-load-times-550366.phtml">Sony's backward compatibility plans for PS5</a>, it's not remotely surprising to hear (and now see) that the next controller will look very similar to the current one. That said, we previously learned that the new gamepad has <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/10/08/an-update-on-next-gen-playstation-5-launches-holiday-2020/">haptic feedback and "adaptive" triggers</a>.</p>

      <p>There won't be any back-of-the-controller paddles like we've seen on the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller. That's understandable, but part of me hopes Sony will offer a premium controller of its own for PS5.</p>
      <p>The DualShock 4 isn't my favorite modern controller, but I'm weirdly attached to it all the same. For PS5, there's a fine line to ride between supporting older games while still branching out to try new things.</p>
      <p>The main difference-maker, <i>I hope</i>, will be a better build quality for the analog sticks to keep them from tearing long-term and a vastly improved battery life. If Sony doesn't strive to address at least those areas with the DualShock 5, I'll be disappointed. Don't make me keep a backup controller on standby.</p>
