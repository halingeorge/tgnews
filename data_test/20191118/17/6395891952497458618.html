      <p><b>WORCESTER, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Mourners have filled a Massachusetts church for the funeral of a fire lieutenant who died after saving two colleagues.</p>
      <p>Funeral services for Worcester Fire Lt. Jason Menard started Monday at St. John's Catholic Church in Worcester. They will be followed by a private burial service.</p>
      <p>While hundreds of Worcester firefighters filled the church, hundreds more from departments across the region lined the streets near the church.</p>
      <p>Menard died Wednesday after he and his crew went into a city home to look for a baby reportedly trapped on the third floor. He helped two colleagues escape but was unable to get out himself.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old Menard left behind a wife and three children.</p>
      <p>A fund for Menard's children has been set up at the Worcester Fire Department Credit Union.</p>
