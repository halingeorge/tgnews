      <h1>Headteacher struck off for swindling school funds to pay for staff parties</h1>

      <p>A primary school headteacher who used school accounts to pay herself extra money has been struck off.</p>
      <p>Wendy Rowlands also fiddled funds to splash out on a staff party with booze, a teachers’ trip to Chester and a hotel room without approval.</p>
      <p>An Education Workforce Council panel heard Ms Rowlands wrote cheques to herself for being in charge of a playgroup at Ysgol Swn y Don, Old Colwyn, Wales.</p>
      <p>She denied this but the committee found the allegation to be true and heard how she tried to hide her mismanagement from council auditors.</p>
      <p>The disgraced teacher did own up to a number of other offences including spending money intended for pupils on the staff party – which was approved by school governors.</p>

      <p>The morale boosting trip to Chester – which governors did not approve – was also paid for with funds meant to benefit schoolchildren.</p>
      <p>She was given the sack last year when an audit revealed failings in her financial management.</p>
      <p>Her misspending is thought to have dated back to 2005, back when she was head at another school which merged to form Ysgol Swn y Don in 2015.</p>
      <p>Ms Rowlands did not attend the hearing and argued her behaviour did not amount to unacceptable professional conduct.</p>
      <p>The panel found she had acted dishonestly enough to hand her an order banning her from the teaching register.</p>
      <p>She can make an application in two years to be considered for reinstatement.</p>
      <p>Committee chairman Robert Newsome said they felt the punishment was necessary given how serious the offences were.</p>
