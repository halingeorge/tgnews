      <p>Today, at the second global technology conference held by CNBC, Huawei revealed that it will release the overall strategy related to Harmony OS on November 20.</p>
      <p>Liang Hua, chairman of Huawei, introduced that Huawei is making great efforts to redesign the products. After the arrival of the new 5G, the market demand is very high.</p>
      <p>According to previous reports, Vincent Pang, senior vice president of Huawei, recently told Business Insider that Huawei will decide whether to bring Harmony OS to the smartphones in the next <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/will-huawei-bring-harmony-os-to-their-smartphones-well-know-soon/">six to nine months</a>. But seems this will happen sooner because the company still can’t work with the US companies such as Google.</p>

        <i>[On August 9, 2019, Huawei held the Huawei Developer Conference in Dongguan, officially releasing Harmony OS. It is a ‘future-oriented’ operating system. It is a micro-kernel-based distributed operating system, covering all the niches. So it can appear on multi-terminal devices such as smartphones, tablets, TVs, smart cars, and wearable devices.]</i>

      <p>Apart from this, as the Huawei executive said, 5G is an infrastructure that can support the development of artificial intelligence. Plus, it can truly amplify the role of the digital economy and promote the development of all mankind.</p>

      <p>Liang Hua’s point of view coincides with Tang Hai, the chief 5G scientist of OPPO. Recently the latter brought its commercial 5G smartphone to Europe. It should hit this market in the nearest future.</p>
      <p>Apart from this, at the conference, Guangzhou Automobile Group’s executive said, with Huawei, they have jointly developed an autonomous system, ADiGO. The system consists of four parts: intelligent driving system, Internet of Things, big data, and voice platform. It can provide good help and driving experience for unmanned safety and convenience.</p>
