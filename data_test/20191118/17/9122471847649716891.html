      <h1>Joel Klatt Goes On Lengthy Rant About Jim Harbaugh, Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:18:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Rumors of Jim Harbaugh <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/jim-harbaugh-report-exit-strategy">being on the outs</a> at Michigan or even losing his touch appear to have been greatly exaggerated. After a 28-21 loss to Penn State in mid-October, the Wolverines have put together three increasingly convincing wins over Notre Dame, Maryland, and Michigan State.</p>
      <p>One analyst who seems especially vindicated for supporting Harbaugh is FOX Sports analyst Joel Klatt. The college football analyst went on a lengthy rant following Michigan’s 44-10 win over the Spartans in support of the embattled Michigan coach.</p>
      <p>Klatt asserted that Michigan – and by extension college football as a whole – are better with Harbaugh.</p>
      <blockquote>“Here are the facts: Michigan is better with Jim Harbaugh. College football is better when Michigan is relevant, which they certainly are at this point. He is a really good head football coach.”</blockquote>
      <p>He went on to explain the differences between Michigan before Harbaugh arrived and now.</p>

      <p>The Wolverines have certainly rallied around their head coach since their bitter losses to Wisconsin and Penn State. They’re now 8-2 and poised to finish third in the Big Ten East.</p>
      <p>A win over Indiana this coming week will lift them to 9-2, and have them confident before they play Ohio State. A convincing win will also look a lot more impressive after the way the Hoosiers took Penn State to the limit this past week.</p>
      <p>Harbaugh may have NFL suitors banging down his door to coach their teams, but he seems determined to make it work at Michigan. And he has a lot more support today than he did a month ago.</p>
