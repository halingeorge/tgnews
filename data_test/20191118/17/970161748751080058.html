      <p>GQ’s Men of the Year include Jennifer Lopez, Tyler, the Creator and Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.</p>
      <p>The popular have just put out their ‘Men of the Year’ issue and the four winners are powerful, inspirational and downright cool.</p>
      <p>Describing each one as at ‘dramatically different junctures in their careers’ and yet all worthy of this recognition, the magazine went on to explain why they have won this award.</p>
      <p>They began with singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, 50, who they called ‘The Icon’.</p>
      <p>In particular, they drew attention to her unreal appearance in 2019’s Hustlers, suggesting it may have been the best film of the year.</p>
      <p>Ultimately she is <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-icon-of-the-year-2019">praised for all the incredible work she has done</a>, being open about her age, potentially being a ‘bad bitch’.</p>

      <p>Secondly there is Tyler, The Creator, 28, who GQ calls The Provocateur, probably because 2019 was ‘his most ambitious year yet’.</p>

      <p>The rapper, singer and fashion designer not only smashed his musical career but also showed the world his true entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

      <p>‘He sold out arena shows, went platinum for the first time with “IGOR,” and expanded his sphere of creative influence in fashion, footwear, and ice cream.’</p>
      <p>And finally, Hollywood heroes Al Pacino, 79 and Robert De Niro, 76, appeared together as GQ’s third winners.</p>

      <p>The duo are about to appear in another movie together, the Irishman, which the magazine describes as potentially ‘one final coronation’ for the two actors.</p>
      <p>In their Men of the Year interviews, the ‘two legends talk earnestly and honestly about their latest film, Martin Scorsese, <i>The Godfather</i>, and five decades of Hollywood fame’.</p>
      <p>What absolute legends.</p>
