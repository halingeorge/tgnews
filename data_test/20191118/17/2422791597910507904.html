      <p>TORONTO – A popular construction heater is being recalled following two separate reports that it overheated and caught fire.</p>
      <p><a href="https://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2019/71577r-eng.php">The recall</a> covers the Mastercraft Construction Heater. According to Health Canada, approximately 10,000 of the 4,800-watt heaters were sold at Canadian Tire locations between 1997 and 2014, when they were discontinued.</p>
      <p>Heaters affected by the recall are blue and can be identified by the item number 052-2604 on rear labels.</p>
      <p>Health Canada said Monday that Canadian Tire had received nine reports of the heaters overheating as of Nov. 8.</p>
      <p>Anyone who owns one of these heaters is being advised to return it to the place where they purchased it, where it can be exchanged for a replacement or store credit with no proof of purchase needed.</p>
