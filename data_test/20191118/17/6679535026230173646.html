      <p>A Cabinet meeting, held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, decided that a Gram Sabha may, at any time, during the period commencing on the 1st day of April and ending with the 31st day of December of any year pass a resolution banning the opening of a liquor vend in its region from April 1 of the next year.</p>
      <p>“The quorum of the Gram Sabha meeting for passing such a resolution shall be one-tenth of its members,” said an official statement.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet also gave authorisation to the Chief Minister for a further period of 6 months for all matters pertaining to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax in the State including framing of new rules and rate of tax, amendments thereto and issue of notifications under the Act.</p>
