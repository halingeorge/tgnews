      <p>WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals panel is voicing skepticism over the Justice Department's claim it can defy Congress' request for secret material from the Mueller report.</p>
      <p>Two of the three judges who heard arguments at a hearing Monday seemed prepared to order at least some of the material sought by the House for its impeachment inquiry to be turned over.</p>
      <p>The House Judiciary Committee is seeking grand jury testimony and other details redacted from the public version of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Last month, a judge ordered the Justice Department to turn over the redacted material, but the Trump administration appealed.</p>
      <p>One judge suggested the House needed the information since the Mueller report left Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump obstructed the Russia probe.</p>
      <p>Trump calls the probe a "witch hunt."</p>
