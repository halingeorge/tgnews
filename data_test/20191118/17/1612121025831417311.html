      <p><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343717-xiaomi-108mp-smartphone-camera/">Xiaomi</a> is known for its aggressive pricing strategies, but sometimes that kind of strategy doesn’t mesh well with <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346373-mediatek-is-launching-an-affordable-5g-chip-on-november-26/">brand new technology</a>, like 5G. But if anyone is going to combine the two, it’s a pretty safe bet that it’ll be Xiaomi.</p>
      <p>Their CEO has doubled down on Xiaomi’s commitment to launching at least 10 new smartphones with 5G connectivity, and now he’s clarified that any phone over €250 will have 5G support on release.</p>
      <p>Compare that to the first slew of 5G phones released earlier this year, like the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/336389-more-galaxy-s10-details-surface-including-pricing-and-5g-availability/">Galaxy S10 5G</a> or Galaxy Note 10 5G, which cost over $1000. Xiaomi’s going to do the same at a quarter of the price. That’s going to rapidly increase 5G adoption, especially in China, and should put pressure on other companies to keep their 5G phones priced a little more modestly.</p>
      <p>These new phones will join Xiaomi’s current lineup of the Mi Mix 3 5G, Mi 9 Pro 5G, and the mythical <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344476-xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-5g-full-screen/">Mi Mix Alpha</a>. Like many of those, these phones will also probably have a 4G-only option for consumers that just don’t care about 5G and want to save some cash. Expect to start seeing these new phones in 2020 and beyond.</p>
