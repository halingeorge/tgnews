      <blockquote>On this episode of <b><i>Made From Scratch</i></b>, Vic Mensa and his sister Lizzy make one of their favorite meals growing up, “Omo Tuo”, a Ghanaian stew. Vic and his sister talk about the drama surrounding his foundation, when a racist landlord kicked them out because of the music video for “Camp America.” Plus, they talk about growing up taking chances, details on his new album, and founding a label. Grab a seat at the table as these artists share their personal stories and the special meaning behind their menu. <b><i>Made From Scratch</i></b> airs Tuesdays at 11:00 pm, ET/PT on FUSE.</blockquote>
