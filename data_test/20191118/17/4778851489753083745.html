        <b>The Brexit Party has withdrawn support from a Scottish election candidate after they were linked to a string of homophobic posts shared on social media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Victor Robert Farrell, an evangelical pastor from Methil, was selected to fight the Glenrothes constituency for Nigel Farage’s party on December 12.</p>
      <p>But the pro-Brexit campaign has tonight distanced itself from the candidate following the revelation of several comments posted on a Facebook account in Farrell’s name.</p>
      <p>One post read: “Western nations look at your hands. Young lesbians in parliament, old lesbians leading political parties. Perverts pushing sodomite rights. The aged living in fear.”</p>
      <p>The posts, originally shared in 2017, were today condemned by Jenny Gilruth, the SNP MSP for Glenorthes.</p>
      <p>She said: “Look at the state of the Brexit Party candidate standing in Glenrothes - crusading against lesbians, rampant youths and all those without god in their lives.”</p>

      <p>Peter Grant, the SNP candidate aiming to hold the seat at next month’s election, said: “It’s not as if he’s been shy about his bigoted opinions either.</p>
      <p>“Will Brexit Party disown him or are they happy to promote such rampant homophobia?”</p>
      <p>A website set up to promote Farrell’s local campaign was taken offline tonight.</p>
      <p>A Brexit Party spokesman said: “The Brexit Party does not share these views. We have withdrawn our support for the candidate.”</p>
      <p>Farrell has not responded to The Scotsman’s request for comment.</p>
