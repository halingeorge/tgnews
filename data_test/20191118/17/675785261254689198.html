      <h1>Prince Andrew 'loses big initiative sponsor as KPMG ends support after interview'</h1>
      <h2>The consultancy firm has cut ties with the Duke of York's Pitch@Palace initiative after the BBC aired an interview over his relationship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:37:21+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Murphy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kpmg-llc">KPMG</a> has reportedly chosen not to renew its sponsorship of Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace intiative.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York founded the mentoring programme in 2014 to help the work of start-up entrepreneurs across the UK.</p>
      <p>But the consultancy firm has now chosen not to renew its sponsorship that ended in October, according to a report by Sky News.</p>
      <p>A source at KPMG said it "made the decision following adverse press scrutiny around Prince Andrew".</p>
      <p>The decision comes after the Duke of York was involved in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrews-offer-emily-maitlis-20906257">widely-criticised TV interview with the BBC</a> over his relationship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>There have been 14 Pitch@Palace events and the event claims to have assisted over 205 businesses since it launch.</p>
      <p>The duke previously said he was "immensely proud" of its work.</p>

      <p>Each Pitch@Palace has a different theme and focuses on different sectors of UK Tech industry.</p>
      <p>Themes so far have included biotech, smart cities and the internet of things.</p>
      <p>A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: "KPMG's sponsorship contract with Pitch@Palace finished at the end of October. A full programme of Pitch@Palace events is continuing across the United Kingdom."</p>
      <p>A KPMG spokesperson told the Mirror that it would not comment officially on the matter.</p>
      <p>The news comes as students at the University of Huddersfield vote on a motion to lobby the Duke of York to resign as its chancellor.</p>
      <p>The motion was tabled after Andrew's interview was broadcast by the BBC on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The president of Huddersfield Students' Union, Emmanuel Haruna, said: "As part of our processes to give students a voice, a student has put forward a motion to lobby Prince Andrew to resign as chancellor."</p>

      <p>A spokesman said Andrew had "long ties" with the university and "his enthusiasm for innovation and entrepreneurship is a natural fit with the work of the university".</p>
      <p>They had "nothing further to add" in relation to the allegations after Buckingham Palace's emphatic denial of any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Andrew was made chancellor of the university in July 2015.</p>
