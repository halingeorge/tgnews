      <p>Police have praised honest residents who have repeatedly handed in bundles of thousands of pounds in cash which have turned up in their village.</p>
      <p>Since 2014, 12 packages of £20 notes have been dumped in plain sight in the streets of Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, and they almost always add up to exactly £2,000.</p>
      <p>The latest unusual find occurred on Monday, with the cash being left at different locations in the former pit community.</p>
      <p>The mystery parcels have led the police to interview local people and speak to organisations including banks and the Post Office, and even carry out tests for fingerprints.</p>
      <p>Despite the police inquiries, the finds remain a mystery.</p>

      <p>Detective Constable John Forster, of Peterlee CID, said: “These bundles are always left in plain sight such as on pavements and discovered by random members of the public who have handed them in.</p>
      <p>“This is the fourth bundle handed in this year.</p>
      <p>“This could be the work of a Good Samaritan but we would like to thank the residents who have shown incredible community spirit by handing the money in.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances remain a mystery so we would welcome any information that will help us get to the bottom of these random incidents.”</p>
      <p>If you have any information, call 101 and ask to speak to DC Forster.</p>
      <p>It is understood anyone handing in the cash could make a claim to keep it if it is not claimed by its owner.</p>
