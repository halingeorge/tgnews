      <p>Ryanair’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=High+Court">High Court</a> action against its chief operations officer <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Peter+Bellew">Peter Bellew</a> will not go ahead this week. The case was listed for hearing on Tuesday and had been expected to last for several days.</p>
      <p>When the matter was mentioned before Ms <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Justice+Leonie+Reynolds">Justice Leonie Reynolds</a> on Monday, she was informed an issue had arisen and the case could not proceed as scheduled on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A new hearing date will be fixed later this week.</p>
      <p>The action centres on Mr Bellew’s decision earlier this year to leave the company in December and join rival airline Easyjet as its chief operating officer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Ryanair">Ryanair</a> claims Mr Bellew has a clause in his contract that prevents him working for a rival for a period of 12 months after the end of his employment with Ryanair.</p>
      <p>Ryanair’s claims are denied by Mr Bellew, who has held a number of senior roles in the aviation industry. He was previously Malaysia Airline’s chief executive and Ryanair’s director of flight operations. The case was initiated last August.</p>
