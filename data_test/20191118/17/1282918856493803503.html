      <p>Amid uncertainty over government formation in Maharashtra, Union Minister Ramdas Athawale said that he was told by Home Minister Amit Shah that the Maharashtra government would be formed soon. Athawale's RPI fought the election as a part of Mahayuti alliance with the Shiv Sena. He also said that he has asked the Shiv Sena to compromise on the rotational chief minister position. </p>
      <blockquote>Athawale said, "Had a word with Sanjay Raut, and told him to compromise. I have asked him for a 3:2 years (3 for BJP, 2 for Shiv Sena) Chief Minister post. I will have a word with BJP now."</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier, Athawale had said that he spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief and Home Minister Amit Shah about the stalemate in the state. "In the all-party meeting, Sena leaders were not present. Today I spoke with PM to try to find a way out of this situation. I told Amit Bhai (BJP President Amit Shah) that if he mediates then a way can be found out to which he replied 'don't worry, everything will be fine", he said.</p>

      <h3>Sharad Pawar to meet Sonia Gandhi</h3>
      <p>Even as Maharashtra remains under President's rule, Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are unable to decide on a common minimum program. ON Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar arrived in Delhi to meet Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi. Earlier in the day, Pawar while peaking to media reportedly said: "Really?" He said, "What talks? Talks regarding what? There are no talks now. BJP-Sena is separate, NCP-Congress is different. How can you say this? They have to pave their path, and we have to pave ours." </p>

      <h3>BJP-Shiv Sena fallout </h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the BJP-Shiv Sena's 'Mahyuti' of 35 years fell out at the state-level with Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray insisting a 50-50 sharing of Chief Minister post for 2.5 years and portfolios and Fadnavis refused to these demands. Both parties are eyeing to form the next government separately in Maharashtra -which is currently under President's rule. While the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress is still in talks to finalise the Common minimum programme to form an alliance, the BJP has vowed that it will form the next government. The Mahayuti alliance swept Maharashtra on October 24, winning a combined tally of 161 (BJP- 105, Sena -56).</p>
