        <li>Nyssa wrote in an <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/instagram">Instagram</a> post: “Wait you don’t think bloating is cute? NEWS FLASH: bloating is normal and just because I don’t have a six pack doesn’t mean I’m not beautiful.”</li>
        <li>The duo is being praised by several followers for their posts that showcase a struggle that’s real for many people.</li>
        <li>Nyssa told Insider: “I know it’s scary <a href="https://www.insider.com/influencers-instagram-vs-reality-side-by-side-photos-real-life-2019-9">being real</a>, but god, is it freeing.”</li>

      <p>Australian social-media influencers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ariellanyssa/">Ariella Nyssa</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/karinairby/">Karina Irby</a> are being flooded with supportive comments in response to candid bikini photos and <a href="https://www.insider.com/body-positive-instagram-accounts-to-follow-in-2019-2018-12">body-positive</a> messages they shared on Instagram, which shed light on a struggle many people face: bloating.</p>

      <p>In the post, shared on Wednesday, Nyssa wrote: “Wait you don’t think bloating is cute? NEWS FLASH: bloating is normal and just because I don’t have a six pack doesn’t mean I’m not beautiful. Just because I don’t have a flat stomach all day everyday doesn’t mean I have to feel ’embarrassed or ‘ashamed’ of my body. You bloat, I bloat, EVERYBODY BLOATS! Don’t you dare feel inferior for it.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B43g7NaBzuZ/">Irby also shared a similar post on Instagram</a>, which she dubbed a “belly appreciation post.”</p>
      <p>Irby wrote: “Change your mindset. Stop thinking that a thin, lean, smooth stomach is the ‘norm’, because it’s NOT! It’s all about genetics, whathankt you eat and moving your body. Look at @ariellanyssa and I. Two young, healthy and active girls and we both have adorable tummies! Just because we don’t have a lean 8-pack doesn’t mean we’re unhealthy or not loving our bodies.”</p>
      <p>Nyssa told Insider that her motivation for using her social-media platform of more than 299,000 followers to get honest about body confidence, self-esteem, and issues like bloating is because she wants her “followers to see how special they are.”</p>
      <p>“I realized after my teen years that I was hating my body for no reason, and that all of the ‘flaws’ and ‘insecurities’ had grown from society’s expectations of the ‘perfect’ female body, and that doesn’t even exist! I want my followers to know that they are a living, breathing miracle,” Nyssa told Insider.</p>

      <p>The Sydney-based influencer went on to say: “Our bodies are just homes for our beautiful souls, and we need to learn how to love them, even if society is telling us we shouldn’t. Bloating and other natural things happen to our bodies. Why should we be ashamed of that? Everybody I know bloats.”</p>
      <h3>Ariella Nyssa’s post bringing attention to the realities of bloating was not the first time she’s talked openly about body positivity</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3JhOQcn--G/">Nyssa shared the above photo in October</a> on her Instagram account, writing: “Your body is beautiful. No matter the angle. No matter the size. No matter the fat percentage. No matter your skin. No matter the size of your stomach. No matter the cellulite. No matter your face.”</p>

      <p>Earlier in November, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4byWOynL31/">Nyssa shared another photo</a> with Irby, writing: “The bloat is REEEEAAAL, and it’s cute AF, and if you don’t think so….. then we don’t care.”</p>
      <p>Nyssa said that being open about body image and documenting her own experiences and thoughts about self-love through her Instagram posts has helped her to build a supportive community online.</p>
      <p>“It warms my heart to know I’m helping people, and honestly, helping myself,” she said. “My posts are like my daily journal entry, and it helps me to be accountable for my self-love journey, too.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I know it’s scary being real, but god, is it freeing.”</p>
      <p>Karina Irby did not immediately respond to Insider’s request for comment.</p>
