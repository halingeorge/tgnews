      <p>Real Housewives Of New Jersey star, Teresa Giudice, has opened up about how proud she feels of her daughter after 14-year-old Milania asked for a nutritionist.</p>
      <p>Teresa is really into fitness and nutrition herself so you can only imagine how happy she was when her daughter followed suit.</p>
      <p>Milania has worked really hard to lose 40 pounds by changing her nutritional and exercise habits recently.</p>
      <p>Teresa revealed to <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/17/teresa-giudice-daughter-milania-40-pound-weight-loss-rhonj/">HollywoodLife</a>: ‘She told me, she’s like, “Mommy, can you get me a nutritionist?”’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘I said to her, “You want me to get you a nutritionist?” And then at first she said no, but then when she was ready, she told me. And then I got her.’</p>
      <p>A mixture of factors has helped Milania to look and feel healthier.</p>
      <p>‘Just eating right’ played a major part in it according to Teresa.</p>

      <p>‘I was getting her meals. I had a nutritionist come to the house and they did her macros and what she should be eating and we teamed up with this meal prep company, Brielle.</p>

      <p>‘That was amazing.’</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old added that Milania had also been exercising with her.</p>
      <p>‘I’m making her meals and exercising. She said she’ll go to the gym with me and she did it.’</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post just a few days ago, Teresa called Milania her ‘shining star’.</p>

      <p>Teresa has four children, Gia, Gabriella, Milania, and Audriana, and it’s been a tough time for the whole family as they navigate life alone while father and husband Joe Giudice served his 41-month prison sentence.</p>
      <p>On 4 March, 2014, both Teresa and Joe entered a guilty plea covering 41 counts of fraud. They were allowed to serve their sentences separately so one parent could always be with the children.</p>

      <p>With all of the difficulty the family has faced, Teresa says she’s just glad to see her daughter doing so well.</p>
      <p>‘She would work, she would do cardio morning and night and weights.</p>
      <p>‘Yeah, she’s amazing.’</p>
