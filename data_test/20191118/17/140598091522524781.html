      <h1>Social media content too 'ghastly' for humans to monitor, Tim Berners-Lee says </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:22:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/mike-wright/" target="_blank">Mike Wright</a></address>
      <p>Social media content is too “ghastly” to be monitored by humans, the British inventor of the web has said. Sir Tim Berners-Lee warned that sifting through harmful and dangerous online content was an “awful job to do” that left people “changed” by the things they saw.</p>
      <p>His comments come as the 64-year-old, who is seen as the father of the modern internet, called for a “mid-course correction” from Governments and tech giants to prevent the web “plunging towards things which could be really bad.”</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Sir Berners-Lee gave this year's Richard Dimbleby Lecture to mark 30 years since he created the world wide web system at CERN that now forms the basic architecture of the internet.</p>
      <p>Following the lecture, Ian Russell, whose 14-year-old daughter Molly took her own life in 2017 after viewing self-harm and suicide marterial on Instagram, asked Mr Berners-Lee if he felt it was as difficult to clean up dangerous content online as tech firms claimed.</p>
      <p>Facebook, which owns Instagram, now employs over 20,000 human moderators worldwide to take down prohibited content flagged by users and artificial intelligence systems.</p>

      <p>It’s latest figures show that Instagram removed almost 10,000 pieces of self-harm and suicide content every day between April and September this year.</p>
      <p>Sir Berners-Lee described the proliferation of such content as “a really big problem” but said that artificial intelligence programmes appeared unable to remove it without human help.</p>
      <p>Asked if social media companies should hire more people to remove harmful content, Sir Berners-Lee said: “Then you have a human being who is paid probably not very much to sit all of their working life looking at things that are borderline really horrible and ghastly. </p>

      <p>“It is not so much the pay, it is that it is an awful job to do. They end up being changed as it is more than a person can take to be constantly asked to make these decisions and to see this horrible stuff.”  </p>
      <p>During his speech, Sir Berners-Lee also called on Governments and tech giants to sign up to a new ‘contract for the web’ and to find ways to combat mass misinformation and data abuses.</p>
      <p>He added: “The web does not have to stay the way it is now. It can be changed, it should be changed, it needs to be changed.” </p>
