        <b>The explosion that knocked down parts of a building in Chattogram’s Patharghata, killing seven people in the process, was not triggered by a leak in the gas line, an investigation has found.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Limited or KGDCL Managing Director Khaiz Ahmed Mozumder disclosed the findings to bdnews24.com on Monday.</p>
      <p>“We found that the gas line, riser and stove in the house were intact. There was no problem in the kitchen either. So, we’re sure the accident was not caused by a gas leak.”</p>
      <p>At least 10 people were also injured in the explosion which occurred on the ground floor of a four-storey building in Patharghata’s Brick Field Road early on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sandhya Nath, a resident on the ground floor of the building, said the explosion happened when a matchstick was lit in a prayer room. His niece Arpita Nath was injured in the blast.</p>
      <p>The KGDCL later formed a four-strong committee headed by General Manager (Engineering and Services) Sarwar Hossain to investigate the explosion. The committee submitted the probe report later on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“If the explosion was triggered by a gas leak, there would have been a huge fire, but that was not the case. We learned that tea was made in the kitchen stove in the morning,” Sarwar told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>The district administration and the Chattogram Metropolitan Police have also formed two separate committees to probe the fatal explosion.</p>
      <p>"We are also working together with the other probe panels to widen the scope of the investigation,” said Mozumder.</p>
      <p>A case over the incident has been filed at a local police station, claiming damages for negligent death.</p>
      <p>Shahina Akter, the wife of a rickshaw-puller who died in the blast, started the case on Monday, said Kotwali Police OC Mohammad Mohsin.</p>
      <p>However, the OC did not reveal the names of the accused citing an ongoing investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>But some police officers indicated the case implicates the two brothers who own the building.</p>
