      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Enpass is switching to a subscription-based model for its password management applications.</li>
        <li>Existing Pro users will not have to pay to keep their Pro features.</li>
        <li>Enpass did not detail pricing for its upcoming subscription.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Enpassed announced that it will switch to a subscription-based model for its password management applications in the near future. Enpass shared the news in a <a href="https://www.enpass.io/blog/general/why-is-enpass-moving-to-a-subscription-model/">recent post</a> and explained the switch. The company also clarified that existing Pro users will not have to pay to retain Pro features.</p>
      <p>Enpass points to two reasons for the switch, clearing up confusion and making its business model more sustainable. Enpass states that some users have a hard time understanding the current model, which requires people to purchase Enpass separately if they want to use it on several platforms. Enpass also admits that the switch is related to making the company more sustainable, "We'll not shy away from the fact that this will make our business more sustainable especially as our company scales up further. It is undeniable that the subscription model is a well-accepted global practice adopted by most businesses, including indie developers, app publishers, as well as legacy software giants like Microsoft and Adobe."</p>
      <p>The post clarifies that Enpass will "continue to be an offline password manager" and adds that Enpass "would never store your data on our servers in any way."</p>
      <p>Perhaps most importantly for existing Enpass users, the company promised that existing Enpass Pro users won't have to pay for a subscription to use the Pro version of Enpass. In fact, existing Pro users get a complimentary subscription which will work across all platforms. Enpass did not share pricing details for the upcoming subscription.</p>

After all, it's another thing to have on your desk if you do a lot of PC gaming and it's not as if you can dispense with your regular keyboard and its full suite of keys. But I'd also never tried one for myself, so I grabbed this SADES one-handed keyboard to take one for a spin</a>
