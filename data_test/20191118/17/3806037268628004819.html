      <p>The communal atmosphere of Thanksgiving, the madness of Black Friday, and the joy of the holiday season are all right around the corner, but no footwear brand is resting on its lapels — all are continuing to churn out appealing releases at a slightly alarming rate. There’s a veritable plethora of drops going down this week, but you gotta know where you’re at to get where you’re going, so let’s take a look back at the last week in footwear news.</p>
      <p>As is par for the course in 2019, the seemingly unstoppable Travis Scott got a lion’s share of the attention once again, with his <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/travis-scott-nike-air-force-1-cactus-jack-cn2405-900-closer-look">Nike Air Force 1 Low “Cactus Jack”</a> dominating the headlines and delighting his legions of loyal fans. Scott’s fellow omnipresent heavy hitter Virgil Abloh kept his usual place in the spotlight with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/nike-virgil-abloh-off-white-vapor-street-ow-athlete-in-progress-second-collection-release-information">three Off-White™ x Nike Zoom Vapor Streets</a> as part of his “Athlete in Progress” capsule. First news of a four-figure <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/dior-jordan-brand-air-jordan-1-collaboration-rumor">Dior x Air Jordan 1 collaboration</a> surfaced as well.</p>
      <p>It’s not just collaborators making noise over at Nike either: they opened a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/nike-snkrs-app-s23nyc-digitial-studio-office-headquarters-ron-faris-interview">new S23NYC studio in New York City</a> that’ll be the home base for cultivating the next generation of the SNKRS app, and officially revealed the holiday return of the beloved <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/air-jordan-11-bred-sneaker-colorway-378037-061-2019-release-date">Air Jordan 11 “Bred.”</a></p>
      <p>Moving on from Nike, adidas announced that its groundbreaking FUTURECRAFT.LOOP program — an effort to create fully recyclable, renewable footwear — would enter its second stage with a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/adidas-futurecraft-loop-phase-2-release-info">new “Phase 2” silhouette</a>. Basketball-centric footwear made some noise as well: Damian Lillard’s new <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/adidas-dame-6-damian-lillard-release-dates-info-photos">Dame 6</a> was officially unveiled, and the Toronto Raptors got a final salute to their 2018 NBA Championship by way of a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/adidas-am4-speedfactory-toronto-raptors-limited-edition-world-champs-release-info">SPEEDFACTORY AM4 that was limited to a scant 613 pairs</a>.</p>
      <p>New Balance and Mizuno both satiated the appetites of their respective fanbases too. NB continued the gradual rollout of Kawhi Leonard’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/new-balance-omn1s-baited-kawhi-leonard-release-info">OMN1S with a “Bated” colorway</a> inspired by his love of fishing, and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/futur-mizuno-second-collaboration-capsule-collection-apparel-wave-prophecy-sneaker">Mizuno linked with FUTUR</a> for bold iterations of its Wave Prophecy.</p>
      <p>Finally, if you’re not going to be able to wear sneakers to your family or job’s holiday festivities, we compiled a list of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/shop-best-mens-holiday-dress-shoes-fall-winter-2019">15 great dress shoes for the holiday season</a>.</p>
      <p>Long story short, it was a week full of drops, details and dashing designs with something for all types of footwear aficionados. There’s plenty more to come over the next seven days, so take a look at some of the best impending drops, and let us know which is your favorite.</p>
