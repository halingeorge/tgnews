      <p>A leaked trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/4/20892306/steven-universe-future-final-season-6-title-sequence-song"><i>Steven Universe Future</i></a> — the mysterious miniseries epilogue for the ever-popular Cartoon Network show — sets up the stakes and reveals some key antagonists.</p>
      <p>The trailer, posted on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/dy2835/steven_universe_future_trailer_1080p/">Reddit </a>and YouTube, starts off by establishing a new normal, as the Gems <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/10/4/20899281/steven-universe-future-enemies-gems-opening-sequence">adjust to life</a> after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/2/20842447/steven-universe-the-movie-review-spoilers"><i>Steven Universe: The Movie</i></a>. But the idyllic sequence is quickly interrupted by some distorted audio, implying something ominous happening in this post-Spinel world.</p>
      <p>Though <i>Steven Universe</i> ended with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/7/6/17543096/steven-universes-season-5-reunited-ending">very finale-like season 5 finale </a>— and the movie itself jumped two years into the future and wrapped things up further — this trailer suggests there are some major loose ends. Something’s up with Pink Pearl, whose shattered eye continues to crack. Also back is Jasper, who we last saw healed from her corruption, but may still be harboring some resentment, as she appears to be leaping into battle. Two antagonists formerly stranded (separately) in space, Eyeball and Aquamarine, appear to have fused. But it’s not just villains! <a href="https://steven-universe.fandom.com/wiki/The_Famethyst">The Famethyst</a>, the group of Quartz guards Amethyst bonded with at Pink Diamond’s human-zoo, also show up in one quick shot.</p>
      <p>There is no release date for <i>Steven Universe Future</i> — or even an official trailer — but we’ll keep this post updated.</p>
