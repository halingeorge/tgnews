      <h1>Why Sadio Mane was substituted for Senegal amid injury fears ahead of Liverpool's trip to Palace</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool's Sadio Mane is a key player for Jurgen Klopp's side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:18:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Sadio Mane was substituted at half time of Senegal's 4-1 win over Eswatini on Monday to spark fears that he had picked up an injury.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool winger was withdrawn at the interval despite the game being goalless after 45 minutes, and did not emerge for the second half.</p>
      <p>But according to Senegalese outlet <a href="https://senego.com/eswatini-vs-senegal-enerve-sadio-mane-remplace-par-sidy-sarr_1002762.html">Senego</a> , the former Southampton attacker was taken off as a precaution because of the yellow card he received and manager Aliou Cisse decided not to risk the 27-year-old being sent off.</p>
      <p>With no injury, Mane is set to be available for Jurgen Klopp's side for their trip to Crystal Palace at the weekend.</p>
      <p>His fitness will come as a boost to the Reds, who are already waiting to see if Mohamed Salah, Andrew Robertson and Jordan Henderson will recover in time for the trip to south London, after they all left their respective international camps this week.</p>
      <p>Salah, in particular, is a big concern after receiving an extended period of time off to recover from an ongoing ankle problem.</p>
      <p>Klopp recently discussed Salah's injury, stating: "I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that it always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that."</p>
      <p>However, Joe Gomez is winning his battle to be fit for the game. Gomez withdrew from the England squad over the weekend ahead of their win over Kosovo on Sunday after suffering a knee injury in training.</p>

      <p>The defender played 20 minutes of the 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday night at Wembley, and according to the ECHO has suffered no long-term damage after a clash of knees during a session at St. George's Park.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk pulled out of the Netherlands squad ahead of their upcoming European Championship qualifier against Estonia on Tuesday, but is also expected to play.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk captained Holland to a 0-0 draw against Northern Ireland on Saturday night as they sealed qualification for next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>But on Sunday, the Dutch FA confirmed that the 28-year-old left the squad due to "personal circumstances", and would miss the Estonia game.</p>
      <p>Liverpool take on Palace hoping to extend their eight point lead at the top of the Premier League table, after they beat Manchester City 3-1 before the international break.</p>
      <p>Despite the points advantage, Van Dijk has outlined how Klopp keeps his players grounded by telling them to focus on each game as it comes.</p>
      <p>He said: “Of course I can sense how much winning the title is ­spoken about.</p>
      <p>“For our fans, winning the championship has been way too long, so they place the Premier League title now above everything.</p>
      <p>“No competition is more ­important than this one, but we need to keep the fever outside.</p>
      <p>“Klopp tells us every week, ‘Focus on the next match’.</p>
      <p>“We are doing alright, but it is only November. The hardest months of football are still waiting.”</p>
