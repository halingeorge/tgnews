      <p>Under 15 Hurling</p>
      <p>Our under 15 hurlers played in Dr Morris Park, Thurles on Thursday, November 14. They played four games against St Josephs Borrisleigh, Borriskane CC, Thurles CBS and Abbey CBS. There were excellent individual performances on the day by goalkeeper Harry Loughnane, wing back Gearoid Maher and Captain Jake Kennedy. The panel for the day was extremely young and shows that this team has a bright future in school hurling. Well done to all the first year hurling panel and management.</p>
      <p>First Year Camogie</p>
      <p>On November 13 our first year camogie team travelled to St Rynaghs GAA pitch Banagher. It was our first ever year to enter the Leinster first year camogie blitz. On a very cold winter day the girls worked very well and put in a great team performance. The teams they played on the day were sacred heart Tullamore, Banagher college na Sionna, and St Brendan's community school Birr. The girls won all three of their matches and won comprehensively.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Sabrina Larkin and all those involved in organising the Blitz. The panel included Ceola Bergin, Kayleigh Brooks, Grace Cleary, Nicola Cleary, Alison Crofton, Sheoladh Cunningham Dynan, Áine Dooley, Laura Hogan, Lucy Kennedy Doyle, Niamh Lee, Molly Loughnane, Abby Loughnane Carroll and Grace Mulrooney. Well done to the TY students that helped out on the day and the team management in preparing the first years so well.</p>
      <p>Open Night</p>
      <p>There was a great turn out on Thursday, November 7, for the Coláiste Phobal Open Night. Prospective parents and students were treated to all that is on offer in Coláiste and a big thank you must go to all staff and students who put in such a huge effort on the night. The positive feedback, comments and atmosphere around the school was fantastic to hear and see and certainly augers well for the future.</p>
