        <b>All the plaudits are being given to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> after his incredible <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/Brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a> win, but the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull</a> driver has given some compliments of his own out, to Fernando Alonso in particular. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Alonso recently praised Verstappen saying <i>"there is no better Formula 1 driver than Max Verstappen"</i> and the Dutchman has repaid the compliment describing him as <i>"one of the best". </i></p>
      <p>The pair raced against each other for four-seasons but never got the chance to go head to head as Alonso was in a weaker <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> whilst Verstappen was in a much better Red Bull.</p>

      <p>Verstappen was full of praise for the two-time World Champion when he spoke to Auto Bild, saying: <i>"For me, Fernando is one of the best and it's a shame not to could have really run against him, because when we were at the same time on the circuits, he did not have a competitive car.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Hamilton, Vettel and Leclerc are very good drivers, although their style is very different. Lewis [Hamilton] and Vettel are already among the best drivers of all time. </i>

        <i>"We are in a sport in which you depend so much on the car, and where the differences are not so much in the steering, but rather in the car you have.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"For example, I think that if Alonso [Fernando] came back in one of the cars at the front of the grid, he would be one of the main candidates to win the title.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Sometimes it's the driver, but sometimes it's bad luck. Look Fernando, he is one of the best, but has been in the wrong team lately."</i>
