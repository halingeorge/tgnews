      <p>If you’ve heard about finishing moves in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare but aren’t sure how to do them then follow these handy tips.</p>
      <p>It may sound like something that’s more likely to crop up in Mortal Kombat but finishing moves are one of the coolest new features in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
      <p>They’re pretty easy to pull off too, if you know the trick to them. They work like stealth kills in other games and to get them to work you need to sneak up to an enemy without being seen and then press the melee button prompt when it appears on-screen.</p>
      <p>That may sound easy but in a hectic game of Call Of Duty it’s anything but. The important thing is that you have to make sure you approach the enemy from behind, as it won’t work from the front or the sides.</p>

      <h3>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare finishing move tips</h3>
      <p>The other thing to be aware of is that the whole finishing move animation takes a good few seconds to run all the way through and during that whole time you’ll be essentially helpless to attacks from other players.</p>
      <p>What can help to ensure a successful finishing move though is if you have the Dead Silence perk, which stops you from making any noise when moving and makes sneaking up on other people a lot easier.</p>
      <p>It’s important to remember that you don’t get any extra points, or any kind of bonus, for performing a finishing move; only you and your victim will know it happened, so it really is just for the kudos.</p>
      <p>If you get good at finishing moves there are quite a few to collect, including stabbing enemies in the back and breaking their necks.</p>
      <p>Which animation plays out depends on where you’re looking when you initiate the attack – so if you’re going for the neck break, for example, then aim high.</p>
