      <h1>Dan Osborne can't stop laughing as I'm A Celeb's Jacqueline Jossa takes on 'savage' challenge</h1>
      <h2>The former TOWIE star found watching his wife walk the plank more than 300ft up in the air absolutely hilarious</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:07:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p>Dan Osborne couldn't stop laughing as he watched his wife <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a> take on her first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> challenge.</p>
      <p>The former TOWIE star was in stitches as Jacqueline walked the plank, suspended more than 300ft in the air.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders actress and her teammate, ex-footballer Ian Wright, had to take on the challenge in an attempt to become one of the cast's two Power Pairs and win a place in the good camp.</p>
      <p>Sadly, she didn't win and ended up being sent to Snake Rock, where she had to sleep on the floor.</p>
      <p>Dan, who shares daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one, with Jacqueline, filmed himself watching the whole thing, and he couldn't stop chuckling.</p>

      <p>He said: "I can't believe she's done the plank, that's awesome, and she's got to sleep on the floor, that's savage.</p>
      <p>"So I'm just going to go up to our super king size, comfortable bed and hope she's sleeping well."</p>
      <p>Despite his giggles, Dan was clearly very proud of his wife for tackling the terrifying challenge.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline did her best to settle into the jungle last night, but expressed her disbelief that she was sleeping on the floor next to Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline and Kate Garraway also teamed up to invent a genius insect defence system - by putting their knickers on their head to stop critters crawling in their hair.</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time Dan and Jac have been separated by a reality TV show.</p>
      <p>Dan took part in the last ever series of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> in 2018.</p>
      <p>The series was shrouded in controversy thanks to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-roxanne-pallett-celebrity-big-13077570">Roxanne Pallett</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-ryan-thomas-celebrity-big-13078203">Ryan Thomas</a> Punchgate scandal.</p>
      <p>But Dan remembers it for a whole other reason.</p>
      <p>Before heading in he'd face a number of cheating allegations and had split from Jacqueline while she was pregnant with their second child.</p>
      <p>He entered the house not long after Jacqueline had given birth, to find he'd be living with former Love Island star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> , who he was accused of cheating on Jac with.</p>

      <p>But Dan set the record straight, saying he and Gabby were just good friends and him and Jacqueline were very much back on.</p>
      <p>And after getting out of the house and returning home, he said they were stronger than ever.</p>
      <p>Dan, who is also dad to Teddy from a previous relationship, told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/">OK!</a> magazine at the time: "Our relationship is better now than it’s ever been. Since getting back together, it feels like we’re stronger and we appreciate each other so much more.</p>
      <p>"In a way we have a lot to thank CBB for, because the time apart made us realise what we were both missing. Things between us are really good right now, it feels like we’re newlyweds again."</p>

      <p>Jac added: "This is very much a delayed honeymoon for us.</p>
      <p>"Our relationship went through a difficult patch this year but now we’re back on track and we wanted to do something to mark our fresh start."</p>
