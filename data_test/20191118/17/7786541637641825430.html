      <p><b>NORTHAMPTON, N.Y.Â (AP)</b> - Authorities have made an arrest in Pennsylvania related to a fatal hit-and-run in the southern Adirondacks.</p>
      <p>New York state troopers say 44-year-old Derrick Carlisle, of Northville, New York was located at about 9:30 p.m. Sunday in Point Township, Pennsylvania. Police there have charged him with receiving stolen property and possessing a firearm without a license.</p>
      <p>Police say he was operating a red 2015 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck that had damage consistent with the accident in Northampton that killed 46-year-old Andria Berger earlier this past weekend.</p>
      <p>Her body was found on the side of Route 30 Sunday morning. Police determined the truck left the scene sometime between 10 p.m. Saturday and 7 a.m. Sunday.</p>
      <p>It could not immediately be determined if Carlisle had a lawyer.</p>
