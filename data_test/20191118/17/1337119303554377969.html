      <h1>Nintendo is adding paid memberships to Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</h1>
      <h2>Tom Nook is never satisfied</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:20:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sam-byford" target="_blank">Sam Byford</a></address>
      <p>Nintendo plans to launch paid subscription memberships for its smartphone game <i>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</i> later this week, according to an <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/a_new_paid_membership_service_is_being_added_to_animal_crossing_pocket_camp">in-game news update</a>. The company says one plan lets you “appoint one lucky animal as your camp caretaker and get some extra help around the campsite,” while with another you’ll “receive fortune cookies and store your furniture and clothing items in warehouses.”</p>
      <p>Nintendo released its latest mobile game, <i>Mario Kart Tour</i>, last month with a surprising optional subscription: a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20883103/mario-kart-tour-available-subscription-price">$4.99-a-month “Gold Pass”</a> that unlocks a faster speed mode and gives users access to more in-game items. The company says it will reveal more information about the <i>Animal Crossing</i> memberships in videos that are due to be released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Despite the hype surrounding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8230767/nintendo-smartphone-games-with-dena-make-sense">Nintendo’s belated decision to start making smartphone games</a> after years of pleas from investors, mobile remains a small part of the company’s overall business. Nintendo doesn’t break out specific mobile sales figures, but in its most recent earnings report said that first-half revenue for mobile and IP licensing totaled 19.9 billion yen. which is up 6.4 percent year-on-year but represents less than five percent of the company’s overall sales.</p>
      <p>“[Mario Kart Tour] earnings are also off to a good start,” president Shuntaro Furakawa told investors at the financial results briefing after commenting on the game’s download figures. “In addition to randomized items, we have created opportunities to generate revenue such as the Gold Pass subscription to meet the various needs of consumers, allowing them to enjoy the game. By including these mechanics and multiplayer functionality, we want to make it an attractive application that will be enjoyed by consumers in the long-term.”</p>
      <p>Nintendo’s mobile games have been hit and miss in terms of both their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20685938/dr-mario-world-candy-crush-puzzle-game-mobile-free-to-play-loot-box">quality</a> and their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16226118/nintendo-fire-emblem-heroes-interview-iphone-android">financial performance</a>, but if subscriptions are a model that turns out to work, you can expect to see more of them in future titles.</p>
