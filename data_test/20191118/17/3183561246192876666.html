      <p>After 84 years (okay, a week) of watching the U.S. chat about Disney+ and <i>The Mandalorian</i>, it's finally Australia's turn.</p>
      <p>Last week we warned you to not get too excited. Despite Disney+ news running rampant online, Australia had to wait until November 19.</p>
      <p>Well it's nearly here and we have the exact release times.</p>

      <p>While we don't know the full suite of content that will be hitting the service in Australia, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/disney-plus-australia-shows-movies">we did get a glimpse</a> of about half of it from a Instagram post that Disney+ Australia posted last week.</p>
      <p>In addition to the vast back catalogue of Disney-produced content (I'll be watching <i>Bedknobs and Broomsticks</i> immediately), we're also going to see the likes of <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Captain Marvel</i>.</p>
      <p>We're also unsure if Australia will be getting shows like <i>The Simpsons</i> due to it being on Foxtel here, or some of the non-PG content.</p>
      <p>In the U.S. Disney+ is being bundled with the likes of Hulu, which Disney also owns, so people can enjoy some of the non family-friendly content as well.</p>
      <p>What we do know is that the service will cost <b>$8.99</b> a month, or $89 for a full year, which gives you up to four concurrent screens and HD + 4K content.</p>
      <p>It will compatible with iOS, Apple TV, Android TV, Playstation, Xbox, and Chromecast among others.</p>
      <p>In terms of what time it will launch, it will go live at <b>9am AEDT</b> (NSW, VIC, TAS, ACT), <b>8am AEST</b> (QLD), <b>8:30am ACDT</b> (SA), <b>7:30am ACST</b> (NT) and <b>6am AWST</b> (WA).</p>
      <p>We'll be back with more info once the platform launches in Australia tomorrow. Fingers crossed that it's <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/disney-plus-bugs-not-working-problems/">a smooth roll out</a>.</p>
