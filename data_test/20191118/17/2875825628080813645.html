      <h1>Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira "no longer at ease" under Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Lucas Torreira has started just four Premier League games under Unai Emery this term and his long-term future is far from certain</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:25:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/lucas-torreira">Lucas Torreira's</a> agent has declared that the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> midfielder is "no longer at ease" under Unai Emery, putting his long-term Emirates future into doubt.</p>
      <p>The Uruguay international was signed from Sampdoria in a £26million deal in 2018, and was seen as something of a coup after impressing at the World Cup.</p>
      <p>But after being a regular last term, he hasn’t been first choice for Emery so far in 2019-20.</p>
      <p>Torreira, 23, has often seen Matteo Guendouzi, Dani Ceballos and Joe Willock preferred by the Spaniard, as well as former skipper Granit Xhaka.</p>

      <p>Torreira is yet to complete 90 minutes in the Premier League, and has started only four times - albeit rarely in the deep-lying midfield role he prefers.</p>
      <p>As such, once again, speculation over his future has flared - having been targeted by AC Milan during the summer.</p>
      <p>Torreira’s ex-Sampdoria boss, Marco Giampaolo, was interested in taking him to San Siro, but <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> had no desire to sell.</p>

      <p>Giampaolo has since been dismissed by the Rossoneri, but now Torreira’s representative, Pablo Bentancur, has stated that a number of clubs are monitoring his situation in north London.</p>
      <p>And he says Torreira isn’t currently pleased with his situation under Emery.</p>
      <p>“I must say that the change of role has penalised him sharply,” Bentancur told <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/bentancur-a-cm-milan-torreira-ecco-perche-non-e-andata-in-porto--25745">Calciomercato.</a></p>
      <p>"He is no longer at ease and we hope that things can change.”</p>

      <p>However, with Xhaka looking likely to depart in January after his fall out with fans, Torriera won’t be departing mid-season.</p>
      <p>That is a situation Bentancur understands and he added: "We have no problem with Arsenal but only words of thanks. Arsenal has allowed Lucas to compete in the Premier League, he has always shown great confidence.</p>
      <p>"Clearly the interest for Torreira are all right, especially by Spanish clubs, but I have never sat down with any club to talk about his transfer. This is because of the great respect we have for the Gunners and general manager Raul Sanllehi.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to name the teams out of respect, but I can tell you that Atletico [Madrid] tried to take Lucas from Sampdoria two years ago.</p>
      <p>"There was an interest [from AC Milan] as well as other clubs [this summer]. But we got together with the Gunners' general manager, Raul Sanllehi, and he immediately told us that for Arsenal, Torreira was not for sale - an adamant position.</p>
      <p>"I also have to say that Milan did not present a real concrete offer."</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, he also admitted that Torreira continues to follow Serie A, and won't rule out a return in future.</p>
      <p>"Lucas follows Italian football with great interest. I can't rule out anything.</p>
      <p>"In Italy he grew up as a player and as a man. He brings to heart his experiences at Pescara and Sampdora."</p>
