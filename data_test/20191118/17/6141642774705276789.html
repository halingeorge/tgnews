      <p>England wicketkeeper Ben Foakes has signed a new four-year deal at Surrey.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has forged a reputation as one of world cricket’s finest wicketkeepers and broke into the Test side last winter before being handed debuts in the 50-over and Twenty20 sides at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>Foakes was man of the series in Sri Lanka after marking his Test debut with a century in Galle but he was dropped after just five appearances during this year’s West Indies tour, the victim of a crowded field that also included Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler.</p>
      <p>He was not selected for the ongoing New Zealand series but, having built a Test average of 41.50 and scored a match-winning 61 not out against Ireland in his only ODI outing, he is widely anticipated to be pushing for further international honours soon.</p>
      <p>Foakes, who started his career at Essex before heading for The Oval in 2015, said: “I am extremely grateful to the club for the opportunity to play here for the coming years.</p>
      <p>“Playing for Surrey has allowed me to achieve childhood dreams and I am excited and determined to replicate those in the coming years.”</p>
