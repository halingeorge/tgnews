      <p>A hailstorm in Australia yesterday is estimated to have cost £21 million of damage.</p>
      <p>The ‘catastrophic’ storm saw hailstorms ‘the size of cricket balls’ pound the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane, leaving 20,000 homes without power.</p>
      <p>Thousands of cars were left with smashed windscreens, while windows of people’s homes were also affected.</p>
      <p>The Insurance Council of Australia declared the storm a catastrophe, saying they had received 5,000 claims in relation to it including from 3,000 vehicles.</p>
      <p>One company alone was working on 200 cars wrecked in the storm.</p>
      <p>Mike Clayton from Clayton’s Towing Service said: ‘It was just total mayhem out there. When it hit, it hit hard and the cars were just destroyed so it was all hands on deck to get them off the highway.’</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-18/sunshine-coast-hail-storm-damages-hundreds-of-cars/11713946">ABC</a>: ‘Some of the windscreens and the windows – the holes went right through them.</p>
      <p>‘The amount of damage on the southern end of the coast is amazing and the size of the hail is not something you would see very often that’s for sure.</p>
      <p>‘A lot of people were really shaken up because of the size of the hail that came down while they were in the car and visibility was nothing. It’s thankful nothing really bad happened.’</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings for large and giant hail, saying there would also be ‘damaging winds’.</p>

      <p>Farmers were also affected, with fruit damaged as it grew on trees from the impact of the hail.</p>
      <p>Nets set up to protect lychees were filled to the top and had to be cut down.</p>
      <p>Lyndon Westbrook told the broadcaster that he returned home to find up to 15 windows of his home smashed.</p>
      <p>Three of his cars were written off and glass was strewn around his garden.</p>
