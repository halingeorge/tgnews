      <h2>Revenues rise at landmark Dublin pub but profits take a hit after recent expansion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:29:09+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/gordon-deegan-7.1837475" target="_blank">Gordon Deegan</a></address>
      <p>Profits at landmark Dublin pub Doheny &amp; Nesbitt last year decreased 18.5 per cent to €237,782.</p>
      <p>New accounts filed by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Swigmore+Inns">Swigmore Inns</a> Ltd show that the business recorded the €237,782 profit in the 12 months to the end of January this year, compared with profits of €291,223 in the prior 12-month period.</p>
      <p>Accumulated profits at the company last year increased from €3.56 million to €3.8 million.</p>
      <p>Doheny &amp; Nesbitt, on Baggot Street, Dublin, was the first pub in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> to exchange hands for over £1 million, in 1987, when brothers Tom and Paul <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Mangan">Mangan</a> bought the premises.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Mangan pub group said today: “We are very, very happy with the performance of the pub in the current year as the investment over recent years continues to bear fruit.”</p>
      <p>The spokesman said that last year revenues were up at the pub but profits were down due to investment costs.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said that the pub had seen an increase in business due to an increased food, wine and whiskey offering at the pub, where he said 50 people are employed.</p>
      <p>The spokesman described the Mangan pub group as a “small but busy group”.</p>
      <h3>Favourite haunt</h3>

      <p>The pub company’s profits last year took account of non-cash depreciation costs of €79,869.</p>
