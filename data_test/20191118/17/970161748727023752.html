      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a> star Joe Keery looked like he was really enjoying his burger while having lunch with girlfriend Maika Monroe, some friends and two adorable little pups.</p>
      <p>So much so that he seems to have gotten some to take home.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old actor – who plays Steve Harrington on the hit-Netflix show – was seen waiting for his burger and chips at a restaurant in West Hollywood, while his actress girlfriend played on her phone and their friends laughed with each other.</p>
      <p>Two adorable little <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a> sit under the table… probably keeping their eyes peeled for any scraps.</p>
      <p>When the foursome get their meals, Joe waits no time before taking a massive bite out of his burger.</p>
      <p>Then, clearly satisfied, Joe and Maika walk off the calories they’ve just consumed with a box of leftovers in hand and the furry little friends in tow.</p>

      <p>What a cute little lunch date.</p>
      <p>Joe and Maika started dating back in 2017 and were spotted <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/07/stranger-things-joe-keery-and-girlfriend-maika-monroe-are-couple-goals-as-they-join-miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-9854613/">posing away alongside Miley Cyrus and ex-husband Liam Hemsworth</a> back in June.</p>
      <p>They were all attending the Saint Laurent runway show in Malibu.</p>

      <p>More recently, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/13/joe-keery-fans-mourn-stranger-things-stars-hair-shows-off-bold-new-look-10740083/">Joe made headlines after he debuted a bold new look</a> that divided fans across the world.</p>
      <p>Joe rocked up to a Chanel event in Los Angeles, with Maika, to celebrate Margot Robbie’s new launch.</p>
      <p>However, all eyes were on his locks as he showed off his new look – going from long sweeping hair to a bit of a front curtains part look.</p>
      <p>To be honest, we’re glad to see he’s grown back his locks since then.</p>
