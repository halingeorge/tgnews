      <h1>Spanish MP launches bid to become Ciudadanos leader</h1>
      <h2>Inés Arrimadas hopes to become the first female head of a major national party.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:04:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Anderson</a></address>
      <p>Inés Arrimadas wants to break Spain's political glass ceiling.</p>
      <p>The MP on Monday announced her candidacy to succeed Albert Rivera as leader of the liberal Ciudadanos party after <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/spains-albert-rivera-resigns-after-ciudadanos-election-slump/">he resigned</a> last week following the party’s disastrous general election results.</p>
      <p>If successful in her bid, Arrimadas — who currently serves as party spokesperson in Congress — would become the first-ever female leader of a major national Spanish party.</p>
      <p>“My goals are humble. I want to elevate this party and hope that the center can again be heard loudly,” Arrimadas <a href="https://www.antena3.com/noticias/espana/la-portavoz-de-ciudadanos-en-el-congreso-ines-arrimadas-tiene-el-reto-de-evitar-que-el-partido-desaparezca-los-mecanismos-para-el-relevo-ya-estan-en-marcha_201911185dd28db50cf2ec7a3480b3e0.html">told news channel Antena 3</a> in an interview announcing her candidacy.</p>
      <p>She added that she believes she has “majority" support to run in the leadership contest. Due to party rules, a special assembly to choose a new leader <a href="https://elpais.com/politica/2019/11/18/actualidad/1574068259_866774.html">isn't set to convene until mid-March</a>.</p>
      <p>Rivera resigned last week after Ciudadanos slumped from the 57 seats it won in April's general election to just 10 seats in the November 10 ballot, losing 2.5 million votes.</p>
      <p>He had led the party since 2006, when it was still a Catalan regional party that sought to counter nationalism and promote the unity of Spain. When Ciudadanos went nationwide in 2014 on a pro-business, anti-corruption platform, it soared in the polls, briefly threatening the dominance of the conservative Popular Party (PP) and the Socialists (PSOE).</p>
      <p>Defining itself as a centrist liberal party, Ciudadanos was widely seen to have moved to the right recently at the behest of Rivera, particularly on the issue of Catalan independence.</p>
      <p>Arrimadas <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ines-arrimadas-catalonia-ciudadanos-party-carles-puigdemont-mariano-rajoy-interview-takes-no-prisoners/">led the party to a surprise victory</a> in a regional Catalan election in 2017, securing the most seats under a single party, though pro-independence parties together retained a narrow majority.</p>
      <p>She said Monday that the recent national election results were “very bad” and that she believed Rivera “has been an example of dignity and responsibility” by resigning.</p>
      <p>“Albert set the bar very high,” she said.</p>
