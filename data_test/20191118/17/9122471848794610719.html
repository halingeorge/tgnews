      <h1>Game Time, TV Channel Set For Oklahoma-Oklahoma State</h1>

      <p>Oklahoma is riding high and can now cruise into the Big 12 Championship Game after beating Baylor this past week. And if they win out, they’ll have a strong case for a spot in the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>But a national title push will require a strong win over one of their biggest rivals: Oklahoma State in the Bedlam Series.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the Big 12 Conference announced the television details for rivalry week. There will be five games spread over Friday and Saturday, but the Oklahoma-Oklahoma State game will get the primetime treatment.</p>
      <p>Kickoff will be at 8:00 p.m. EST on FOX.</p>

      <p>Oklahoma boasts an elite offense run by a Heisman Trophy candidate in quarterback Jalen Hurts. The Sooners proved their resilience this past week with a massive comeback win over Baylor to take the lead in the Big 12 title race.</p>
      <p>But Oklahoma State has quietly put together a very solid season, and now sit third in the Big 12 standings at 7-3. Despite losses to Texas, Texas Tech and Baylor, the Cowboys have scored at least 27 points in every game.</p>
      <p>The Sooners defense has been pushed to the limit against Kansas State, Iowa State and Baylor over the past few weeks. But overlooking Oklahoma State – even with a spot in the title game wrapped up heading into it – is something they cannot afford.</p>
