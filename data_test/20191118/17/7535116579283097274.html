      <p>If you have never taken off your shoes to get into shops, then you’ve never truly experienced Malaysia. That said, it’s pretty common knowledge that taking them off comes with a risk!</p>
      <p>A CCTV recording shared on<a href="https://twitter.com/ShazzsAriel977/status/1195751848352735232"> Twitter</a> by a user that goes by the name @ShazzsAriel997 helped victims debunk the mystery of a pair of missing shoes that occurred at a vape store near Seri Kembangan.</p>
      <p>“Salam dear Twitter users, please make this video viral. My friend’s shoes were stolen at Vaporhub, Seri Kembangan. He had just taken them off. It would be really helpful if you could cooperate. Even if it’s just a pair of shoes, a thief is a thief. Just in case anyone knows or has seen this boy.”</p>

      <p>The video shows the thief slipping into a pair of checkered Vans right after the owner went into the shop, and he even nabs a second pair of shoes and casually walked away with them. The video received a lot of attention from the netizens with 11.6K retweets and 5.2K likes.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the public’s help, the boy himself texted the victim and apologised, claiming that he “accidentally took the shoes,” and that he would return both pairs soon.</p>

      <p>Although it was wrong, the public admitted that they were quite impressed with the boy’s ‘professional’ thievery. <i>Still, stealing will never be encouraged, kids.</i></p>
      <p>“What a simple method to steal.”</p>
      <p>“Professional.”</p>

        <i>Either way, some people suggested that the video should be taken down while others think that it should be a great lesson to the boy. What do you think? Should Shaz delete his post? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.</i>
