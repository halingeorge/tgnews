      <p>Liverpool are well-represented in Alan Shearer's Premier League team of the season so far with no fewer than four players being named.</p>
      <p>Things aren't so rosy for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> though, with not one player from either club making the cut.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester City</a> are the second best-represented club in the XI, with three players being including in Shearer's team.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> have just one player representing the champions.</p>
      <p>In goal Shearer has selected Dean Henderson as the man who's been most impressive between the sticks so far this season.</p>
      <p>The Sheffield United keeper, on loan from Manchester United, has upstaged the man ahead of him at Old Trafford, David de Gea, according to Shearer's selection.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Blades have been punching well above their weight this year and sit fifth in the Premier League - above both Arsenal and Man United - and have conceded just nine goals, bettered only by the Foxes.</p>
      <p>Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson patrol the flanks in Shearer's team, while another Blades star in the form of John Egan stands at centre-back.</p>

      <p>Joining him in defence is the man who has replaced Harry Maguire at the King Power Stadium, Caglar Soyuncu - another blow for United.</p>
      <p>Moving into midfield and Shearer has selected Liverpool's "lighthouse" Fabinho.</p>

      <p>In front of him stands James Maddison, Sadio Mane, and the only Man City player selected in the XI, Kevin de Bruyne.</p>
      <p>Finally, up top, Shearer has named two strikers: Jamie Vardy and Tammy Abraham.</p>

      <p>Things looked like they were slowing down for Vardy last season now that he is in the twilight years of his career, but he's enjoying a new lease of life under Brendan Rodgers.</p>
      <p>Vardy has netted 11 times so far this season, and, as of right now, is the Premier League's most lethal marksman.</p>

      <p>Hot on his heels is the new kid on the block, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> forward Abraham, who has taken the top fight by storm this campaign.</p>
      <p>Abraham has 10 goals to his name and given that he's brimming with confidence, is showing absolutely no signs of letting up.</p>
