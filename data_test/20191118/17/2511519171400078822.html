      <h1>Third person diagnosed with deadly plague in a week in China</h1>
      <h2>Health authorities put 28 people in quarantine after two cases of disease in Beijing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:56:56+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author">Conrad Duncan</a></address>
      <p>A 55-year-old man has been diagnosed with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bubonic-plague">bubonic plague</a> after killing and eating a wild rabbit in northern <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/China">China</a>, resulting in a further 28 people being put in quarantine, according to health authorities.</p>
      <p>The case is the third reported example of plague in the country over the past week, adding to two plague cases which were discovered in the capital of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Beijing">Beijing</a>.</p>
      <p>A statement from the health authority in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region said the man was being treated at a hospital in the city of Huade.</p>
      <p>It said investigators had learned the patient, who is from Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia, consumed the rabbit on 5 November.</p>
      <p>Twenty-eight people who had close contact with the man are still under observation but none of them have shown plague symptoms, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The health authority added that no new cases of plague have been found in the region.</p>
      <p>On 12 November, two patients from the same area were diagnosed with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/pneumonic-plague">pneumonic plague</a> in Beijing – although the two incidents are not thought to be related.</p>
      <p>Pneumonic plague, which is more severe than the bubonic version, is believed to be the type of plague that was mainly responsible for the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/black-death">Black Death</a> in the 1300s.</p>
      <p>The disease can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of people infected if they do not receive treatment, which primarily involves taking several types of antibiotics.</p>
      <p>Although China has largely eradicated plague, occasional cases are still reported, often among hunters who come into contact with fleas that carry the bacterium.</p>
      <p>The last major known outbreak of the disease was in 2009, when several people died in Qinghai province in northwest China.</p>

      <p>After an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sars">SARS</a>) in 2003, which led to 774 deaths, China has vastly improved its detection and management of infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>In those cases, China was accused of initially covering up the outbreak and dragging its feet in cooperating with the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-health-organisation">World Health Organisation</a>, allowing the disease to spread outside of the country.</p>
