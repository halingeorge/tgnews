The newest announcements about the series revealed that <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-plus-marvel-female-loki-sophia-di-martino/">Sophia Di Martino</a> (<i>Flowers</i>) will co-lead the series, potentially as the female version of Loki.</p>
      <p>With the rumors Sophia Di Martino will be playing the female version of Loki, we're taking a look back at how the Asgardian God of Mischief was has a history of alternating genders in the main comic book Marvel Universe and how that might inform the future of the character in the MCU.</p>

      <p>During the events of <i>Avengers: Disassembled</i>, Thor and the rest of Asgard were besieged by various enemies. Thiswas finally the coming of Ragnarok, and the battle ended with the deities beginning anew on Earth. Loki stole the form meant for Sif and took on the visage of a young woman. When all the Asgardians were brought back to life, Sif's spirit ended up trapped in an elderly woman who was dying from complications related to cancer who was in a hospital where Jane Foster worked.</p>

      <p>Sif's human body remained empty until Loki took it for his own and made it his new form. Working with Doctor Doom and the rest of the Cabal, Loki manipulated Thor and Baldur, setting up schemes to benefit the Cabal. She even tried to manipulate the Avengers by taking on the visage of Wanda Maximoff, partly to sow chaos among the other members of the Cabal. Eventually, Sif's spirit was found, and Loki regained his typical masculine appearance, just in time to be killed during the events of <i>Seige</i>. When Loki was next restored, he appeared as a young man, and no longer as a woman. However, Loki has become more gender-fluid in recent years, even transforming back and forth from male to female at will.</p>
      <h3>HOW SHE COULD COME INTO PLAY</h3>

      <p>Long before the Marvel Universe was around, North mythology saw Loki change his form -- and his gender -- multiple times over teh course of various myths. Loki even became a mother, transforming into a female horse and giving birth to the eight-legged steed Sleipnir. This has become a more prevalent element of the Marvel Universe Loki in recent years, along with Loki generally becoming less of an outright villain and turning more into a dependable figure. Mackenzi Lee's YA novel <i>Loki: Where Mischief Lies</i>, which was released earlier this year, portrayed the character as openly pansexual and genderfluid, which suggests a changing perspective on how Loki is seen by Marvel.</p>
      <p>If <a href="https://screenrant.com/disney-plus-marvel-loki-cast-sophia-di-martino/">the reports</a> that Sophia Di Martino will be playing Lady Loki are true, it suggests that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going to move in that direction as well. Going by the take on the character from the Marvel Universe, it could open up the show to bringing a broader perspective of gender to the superhero franchise. It also would make sense why Loki would be willing to change his appearance throughout, as the series is expected to center around a version of Loki who is on the run following the events of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. The other appearance might help him blend into a crowd when the universally known God of Mischief might be better recognized. It also might play into the upcoming <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>, which will allow Jane Foster to become the female version of Thor.</p>
      <p><i>Loki</i>, starring Tom Hiddleston and Sophia Di Martino, is set to hit Disney+ sometime in spring 2021. <i>Rick and Morty</i> writer Michael Waldron will write the series and be billed as creator, with <i>Sex Education</i>'s Kate Herron directing all the episodes.</p>
