      <p>A man and woman have been arrested after a 25-year-old was killed in crash on one of the Midlands' busy dual carriageways.</p>
      <p>Detectives from Staffordshire Police confirmed a 41-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman, both from Walsall, were detained after the crash on the A5 on Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>The man, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene at around 12.30am and specialist officers were supporting his family.</p>
