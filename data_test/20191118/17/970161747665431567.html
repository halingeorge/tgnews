      <p>Sally Lindsay has spoken out about working class women being ‘ignored’ by society.</p>
      <p>The actress stars in new thriller Cold Call about as carer June who seeks revenge after her mother is scammed out of a large amount of money.</p>
      <p>Sally, 46, feels her ‘she-wolf’ character’s actions in the drama are justified as working class older women are so often overlooked.</p>
      <p>‘What happens to her mum spurs her on to feel so bereft and so lost and awful and guilty, so she feels she has to correct it,’ she told Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>‘She feels she has to make this right. She needs some sort of revenge and retribution.</p>
      <p>‘It is a very twisty and turny thriller so it’s quite a difficult thing to explain, but I found all of her reasons justifiable. Especially as a mother and as a woman and as a working class woman, and as a working class woman of a certain age.</p>

      <p>‘Not so much me but you do sometimes feel invisible. If you’re stood in a shop or you’re at a bar, you’re last person to be served because you’re a middle-aged woman. And I think that’s what happens with June and they completely underestimate her because she’s invisible.’</p>

      <p>The former Coronation Street star hopes that the show will be educational as well as entertaining, so viewers learn how they can protect themselves from falling victim to fraud.</p>
      <p>‘If you have a phone and a bank account they can get you. I got emails from Natwest bank saying you’re overdrawn or this or that. I don’t bank with Natwest so obviously I know it’s not a genuine email. If I did bank with them I would be horrified and try and get back to them because you want everything to be right.</p>

      <p>‘I can’t even stand getting a parking ticket! I’m crying me eyes out and there’s this bloke knocking on the window. I absolutely could afford it but I’m like, “no it’s wrong. I didn’t know you couldn’t park here.” I was heartbroken.</p>

      <p>‘If that’s how you’ve been brought up, it’s completely alien when people tell you well you’re gonna get this, they might take all your money out and it’s fraud. It’s about fear.’</p>
