      <h1>Couple outraged to find Aldi label on their Waitrose vegetables</h1>

      <p>A couple who bought a packet of roasted vegetables from Waitrose were dismayed to find it was labelled from Aldi.</p>
      <p>They ordered the veg on Ocado, and it arrived seemingly fine, with the front of the packet reading as expected.</p>
      <p>Its underside told a different story, however, saying it had been ‘specially prepared’ for the budget supermarket.</p>
      <p>The husband, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘I was really disappointed. I use Waitrose and Ocado for good reasons – reputation and home delivery.</p>
      <p>‘And I pay for the privilege.</p>
      <p>‘No disrespect to Aldi or their customers but if I wanted their products I’d go to one of their stores.’</p>

      <p>Aldi sell a similar product called Ready to Roast Winter Roast/Mediterranean Roast, which is the same weight but costs just £1.29.</p>
      <p>The couple complained to Ocado and told <a href="http://live-uk.andweb.dmgt.net/news/article-7694571/Outraged-couple-Aldi-stickers-covering-Waitrose-Mediterranean-roast-vegetables.html">MailOnline</a> they received this in response: ‘Thank you for your email. I am sorry to hear that the Waitrose Mediterranean Roast Vegetables received were packed for Aldi.</p>
      <p>‘I have now reported this to the relevant team in order to investigate things further with our supplier. I do apologise for the inconvenience caused and once we have an update we will get back in touch.</p>
      <p>‘Please let us know if you have further questions in the meantime and we will be more than happy to help.’</p>
      <p>A Waitrose spokesman said: ‘We are sorry that there has been an error with the labelling at our suppliers and we are now looking into this.</p>
      <p>‘As with all retailers, we will share suppliers for some of our products.</p>
      <p>‘Any price variation will be reflected in the different specification of the product, such as ingredients used.’</p>
