      <h1>Ubisoft turns Assassin’s Creed into an audio drama with Audible</h1>

      <p>Ubisoft today revealed it’s collaborating with Audible on a new audio drama, set in the <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> series. This new venture, called <i>Assassin’s Creed Gold</i>, is the company’s latest effort to branch out into new ventures using the <i>Assassin’s Creed </i>series.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/riz-ahmed-assassins-creed-gold-audio-drama">According to SyFy Wire</a>, the story is set, as almost all <i>AC </i>stories are, partially in the modern day and partially in the historical setting <i>du jour </i>— in this case, the Great Recoinage of 1696. The main character is a young Assassin named Aliyah Kahn, who relives the life of an ancestor named Omar Khalid. The big historical figure to make an appearance is Isaac Newton — yes, THAT Isaac Newton, who was head of the British Royal Mint at the time.</p>
      <p>Note that this isn’t an audiobook, like you might be expecting from Audible. It’s instead an “audio drama,” meaning the story will be acted out, a la radio serials. The actors involved include Riz Ahmed, Anthony Head, and Tamara Lawrance.</p>
      <p>The choice of an audio drama might come as a surprise, but if you didn’t already know, Ubisoft has created a multimedia cottage industry out of the <i>AC </i>series. In addition to that 2016 movie you might have heard about, it’s released mobile games, comic books, and a series of young adult novels, all under the <i>Assassin’s Creed </i>banner. Aymar Azaizia, head of Ubisoft’s transmedia, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-18-all-star-cast-named-for-assassins-creed-series-on-audible">says of </a><i>Gold,</i> “As an entertainment company, we are always looking after new ways to immerse players into our worlds, and we strongly believe <i>Assassin’s Creed Gold</i> offers a great opportunity for all our fans to dive into a new storyline inspired by <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> franchise.”</p>
      <p>Basically, whenever Ubisoft wants to do something new or weird, it usually taps the <i>Assassin’s Creed </i>series to be its guinea pig. The sole exception so far was the company’s <a href="https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/09/25/ubisoft-game-design-course-concordia/">prefab college course</a> about making video games, which involved the <i>For Honor</i> universe.</p>
      <p>The latest game in the series — <i>Odyssey</i>, which you might remember <a href="https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2018/10/01/review-assassins-creed-odyssey/">I liked but didn’t love</a> — doesn’t make mention of either the Assassins or the Templars (in fact, it’s set before either group existed). So it’s nice to see the company get back to its roots — some good, old-fashioned historical beef retrofitted to include the Templars and Assassins.</p>
      <p>Well, if you’re anything like me, then you have some Audible credits just laying around, waiting to be spent. And for all my bluster, I’ve been invested in the story of <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> for over a decade now (yes, I’m old). So I have to at least see what it’s all about.</p>
      <p>The series launches on February 27. We’ve contacted Ubisoft to find out if it’ll be released all at once or episodically.</p>
