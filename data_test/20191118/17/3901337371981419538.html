      </p>
      <p>On Sunday, <i>Forbes</i> revealed the four clubs expected to top the annual Deloitte Money League, which ranks the world's richest football clubs.</p>
      <p>The ranking is only set to be released in January next year but, with the world's biggest clubs having all released their financial data, the top four have seemingly been revealed ahead of time.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Los Blancos, who came out on top last year, have now been dethroned by arch-rivals FC Barcelona heading into the year 2020.</p>
      <p>The Catalan giants rise to the top after seeing their revenue grow from €690 million (R11.2 billion) in 2018 to €852 million (R13.8 billion) in 2019.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Conversely, Real's revenue increased by only €6 million (R97 million) from €751 million (R12.2 billion) to €757 million (R12.3 billion).</p>
      <p>Manchester United and Bayern Munich, who were ranked third and fourth, respectively, in 2018, are expected to occupy the same positions in next year's Deloitte Money League.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils' annual turnover was reported to be €732 million (R11.9 billion) while Bayern's comparative revenue amounts to a reported figure of €652 million (R10.6 billion).</p>

      <p>Despite the above rankings, the report also revealed that Real are in "better health" than Barca when considering player wages and earnings before interest, among other factors.</p>
