      <h1>Fire Damages Cardboard &amp; Packaging Plant in Lehavim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:59:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>Firefighters from Be’er Sheva, the Bedouin city of Rahat and a number of district stations worked for hours to combat a blaze Monday morning in the <a href="http://www.cargal.co.il/">Kargal cardboard and packaging factory</a> at the Idan Ha’Negev industrial park.</p>
      <p>The park is located in Lehavim, near Be’er Sheva.</p>
      <p>One of the main concerns was to keep the fire from spreading to a fuel tank located in the factory, according to Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson Adir Naim.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported. It’s not clear what started the blaze.</p>
