      <h2>The iconic red hat makes way for a blue and red cap</h2>

      <p>With an aim to make traffic police personnel feel more comfortable during long hours on weekends, the Police Department has changed their uniform from white shirt to white-blue T-shirt. Traffic police will sport blue cotton headgear in place of the conventional red caps, the hallmark of the men in uniform since the French rule, on weekends.</p>
      <p>“We have started posting men with the new attire since last weekend. The decision was taken after the traffic police made a request to change the uniform on weekends as they feel uncomfortable,” Niharika Bhatt, Senior Superintendent of Police (Traffic), told <i>The Hindu</i>. The new uniform would be effective on long holidays, she added.</p>
      <p>The heavy inflow of tourist on weekends stretched the working hours of traffic constables beyond their regular stipulated duty hours, said the senior police officer.</p>
      <p>On certain days, the personnel would not be able to take a break. “On such occasions wearing the conventional shirt is not comfortable considering the humid condition,” the officer said. On weekends, around 100 traffic constables would be on the roads to regulate traffic in the town and suburban areas.</p>
