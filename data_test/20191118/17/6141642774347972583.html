      <p>Max Verstappen claimed his third victory of the season following a superb drive in Brazil.</p>
      <p>But the penultimate round of the Formula One season will be remembered for Sebastian Vettel’s collision with Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency looks at five things we learned from Sunday’s race.</p>
      <h3>1. How do you solve a problem like Ferrari?</h3>

      <p>Verstappen passed Hamilton twice en route to claiming his third win of the season. The Red Bull driver proved his once-in-a-generation talent with a dazzling 75 seconds following his first stop. Verstappen lost the lead after backmarker Robert Kubica almost put him in the pit-wall following an unsafe release by the Pole’s Williams team. Verstappen emerged well behind Hamilton but followed the Mercedes driver through when he overtook Leclerc, and then passed Hamilton at the first corner with a fine move. To cap a brilliant day for Verstappen, his Red Bull team smashed the pit-stop world record, changing all four of the Dutchman’s tyres in just 1.82 seconds.</p>

      <p>The madness of Sunday’s race was perhaps best summed up when Toro Rosso driver Pierre Gasly outgunned Hamilton’s Mercedes to the chequered flag, beating the world champion to the runner-up spot by just 0.062 seconds. This has not been an easy campaign for the 23-year-old Frenchman, dropped by Red Bull after just 12 races. But after claiming a career-best second place, Gasly said: “As a kid, you dream about being in Formula One. And then when it happens, it becomes the best day of your life. You then dream of your first podium, and this is now the best day of my life.”</p>
