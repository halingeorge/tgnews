        <b>Jose Mourinho was warned about signing 'big baby' Romelu Lukaku, according to Everton's former director of football Steve Walsh.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Walsh was at Everton when United signed Lukaku in 2017 and says he warned the then Old Trafford boss about the Belgian's behaviour.</p>
      <p>Former Leicester scout Walsh, who was credited with playing a key role in the Foxes' Premier League triumph in 2016, had previously worked with Mourinho at Chelsea during his first spell at the club.</p>
      <p>Walsh told <a href="https://theathletic.com/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/"><i>The Athletic</i>:</a> "When Jose [Mourinho] signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, I remember saying to him, 'You have to be careful with Lukaku. He is a big baby, you know'.</p>

      <p>"He said he could handle him. I don't think he really got Lukaku on-side mentally, which you have to do.</p>
      <p>"That is the case with him and Paul Pogba. They aren't my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team. I wouldn't have touched them. Because they are good players doesn't mean you are going to get a good team out of it."</p>
      <p>Walsh was sacked by Everton in May 2018, with Marcel Brands taking on the director of football role.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who started Lukaku regularly, was sacked last December less than 18 months after signing the Belgium international striker, who followed the Portuguese manager out of the <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11860/11779868/inter-milan-sign-romelu-lukaku-from-manchester-united">Old Trafford exit door this summer</a>, moving to Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old told Belgian newspaper <i>Het Belang van Limburg</i> at the weekend that he had decided in March that he wanted to leave United.</p>
      <p>Lukaku scored 42 goals in 96 appearances during his time in Manchester and already has nine goals in 15 appearances this season for Inter.</p>
