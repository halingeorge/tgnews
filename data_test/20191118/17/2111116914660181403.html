      <p>Honor is set to unveil its Watch Magic 2 smartwatch on November 26 in China, and more than a week ahead of the launch TechRadar can share some exclusive pictures of the smartwatch.</p>
      <p>While they're not hugely revealing, they show us enough about the upcoming wearable to give us a good idea of what to expect when it launches.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Could this be one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/best-smart-watches-what-s-the-best-wearable-tech-for-you-1154074">best smartwatches?</a></li>
        <li>What do we expect to see in the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/honor-view-30">Honor View 30</a>?</li>
        <li>These are the best <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cheap-smartwatch">cheap smartwatches</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Something we can tell from the images is that the body of the Honor Watch Magic 2 has seen a re-design from its predecessor – the bezel looks to be thinner, and rises less from the screen of the watch. </p>
      <p>This indicates a departure from the 'classic' look of a wristwatch, which many smartwatches mimic.</p>
      <p>The Watch Magic 2 also looks more monochromatic than before, with the device all black (save a red ring on the crown, like in the original Watch Magic), and white text around the dial instead of pink like before.</p>

      <p>Of course, this could be just the style of the one device TechRadar was shown, with other colored variants available at launch. It's also possible this is a design decision to make the Watch Magic 2 look more sleek.</p>
      <p>The strap also looks to be leather, like the Watch Magic, but again it's monochromatic black, unlike the older device which had a brown leather strap with white cotton threads.</p>
      <p>The images show the Honor Watch Magic 2 as a more modern-looking device, shirking the classic wristwatch look of old for a more decidedly 'smartwatch' feel. We don't know much about the specs or internals of the device yet, but there's not long to go until it's officially unveiled.</p>
      <p>That's set to happen alongside the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/honor-view-30">Honor V30</a> launch in China, which is happening in Beijing on November 26.</p>
