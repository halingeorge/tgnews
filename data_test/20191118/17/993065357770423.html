      <p>POLICE in Banbridge are appealing for information after a man suffered a blade injury to his face in what has been described as a "totally reckless and brutal attack".</p>
      <p>The incident occurred in the Scarva Street area of the Co Down town between 2 and 3am yesterday when the victim went to help another man who was lying on the ground.</p>
      <p>He was attacked by two or three males and suffered a "significant cut" to his jawline, which police believe could have been caused by a Stanley knife.</p>
      <p>A PSNI spokesman said: "The man attended hospital and received stitches to his injury; and his condition is, thankfully, not believed to be life-threatening at this time."</p>
      <p>Urging anyone who was in the area at the time to come forward, the spokesman added: "This was a totally reckless and brutal attack, which could have had devastating consequences. The man, understandably, remains badly shaken from this disturbing ordeal."</p>
