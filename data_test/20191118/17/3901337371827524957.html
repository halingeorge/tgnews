      <p>In the most recent international break, Southgate's troops were at their free-scoring best, winning 7-0 and 4-0 in their latest two encounters, respectively.</p>
      <p>Managing to get on the scoresheet in both games was United's Rashford, who has now contributed 11 goals in his past 10 matches for club and country.</p>
      <p>In the Three Lions' recent 4-0 win over Kosovo, the United attacker produced a bit of skill that had fans on social media comparing it to a move often done by former Red Devils superstar Ronaldo.</p>
