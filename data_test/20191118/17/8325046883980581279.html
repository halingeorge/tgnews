      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/venmo">Venmo</a>, one of the most popular money transfer apps, makes it easy to pay back your friends after an outing or event, without the hassle of handing out cash or making change.</p>
      <p>However, if you want to pay someone back for something, and the balance on your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/venmo">Venmo</a> account isn’t enough to cover it, the app will take the entire sum out of your linked bank account or card instead, which can be annoying.</p>
      <p>If you want to avoid this, you can add money from your linked bank account to the app manually, as long as you’ve been approved for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-a-venmo-card">Venmo Card</a>.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t been approved for, or don’t want, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/venmo-card">Venmo Card</a>, you can still add money to your account – you just have to do it from your computer.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to add money to your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/venmo">Venmo</a> account.</p>
