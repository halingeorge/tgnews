      <h1>Gorgeous BMW M8 Gran Coupe Enters Production</h1>
      <h2>The new BMW 8 Series family is now complete.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:45:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>The new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/8-series-gran-coupe">BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe</a> is one of the Bavarian automaker's best-looking models yet. But it didn't take long to get even better. Back in October, BMW <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/say-hello-to-the-2020-bmw-m8-gran-coupe">introduced the more powerful M8 version of the elegant four-door coupe</a>, and we've been swooning over it ever since.</p>
      <p>Now, the first-ever <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m8-gran-coupe">BMW M8 Gran Coupe</a> has entered production at the automaker's plant in Dingolfing, Germany, completing the new 8 Series family. BMW's Dingolfing plant produces up to 60 units of the BMW M8 model family per day, but the Gran Coupe is already proving popular as it accounts for over 40 percent of the M8's production volume.</p>

      <p>"With the new BMW M8 Gran Coupe, the location once again proved what it is made of. After five successful attempts in 2019, we once again topped the top of our model portfolio and strengthened our position as the leader of the luxury segment. All employees can be proud of that," said Christoph Schroder, Head of BMW Group's Dingolfing plant.</p>
      <p>Like all other M8 models, the gorgeous Gran Coupe is powered by a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 that sends 600 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Competition variant increases the output to 617 hp. 0-62 mph in the regular M8 Gran Coupe takes just 3.1 seconds, while the Competition model can do the same sprint a tenth of a second quicker. Both cars max out at an electronically limited 155 mph, but this can be increased to 190 mph with the optional M Driver's Package.</p>
