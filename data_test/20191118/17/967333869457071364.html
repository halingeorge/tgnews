      <p>Pakistan has historically been uneasy with its Hindu heritage but things seem to be changing under the ruling Imran Khan government.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.radio.gov.pk/13-11-2019/govt-decides-to-reopen-hindu-temples-pti-spokesperson">Pakistan’s ruling party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's spokesperson</a> Ahman Jawad has announced plans to restore Hindu places of worship. </p>
      <p>The India-Pakistan partition in 1947 resulted in the closure Hindu and Sikh shrines in the country.</p>
      <p>A survey by the All-Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement earlier this year revealed that at the time of partition, 428 Hindu temples existed in Pakistan but only 20 remain operational.</p>
      <p>In April this year, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911091077259629-sikhs-rejoice-as-indo-pak-corridor-paves-the-way-for-pilgrims-to-visit-shrine-in-pakistan-/">Pakistan government</a> announced plans to re-open 400 of the 428 temples. It also cleared a plan to allow Indian tourists to visit Sharda Peeth, an ancient Hindu religious and cultural site in<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911091077263218-prime-minister-modi-thanks-pakistans-imran-khan-for-cooperation-on-sikh-corridor-/"> Pakistan-administered Kashmir</a>.</p>
      <p>Taking another positive step towards the minority Hindus, Jagannath Temple in Pakistan’s Sialkot city was reopened in July after 72 years.</p>

      <p>The changes are not just at the bureaucratic level, but also at the judicial level, with the Supreme Court of Pakistan making judgements in favour of Hindus.</p>
      <p>Similarly, in September 2019, Muslims escorted Hindus to a temple in Ghotki district after riots broke out in the area over an alleged blasphemy committed by a Hindu teacher.</p>
      <p>Pakistan also plans to begin the renovation of two to three historic and heritage temples every year. The restoration process will begin with two historic temples – the 1,000-year-old Shivalaya Teja Singh Temple in Sialkot and Gorakhnath Temple in Peshawar.</p>
