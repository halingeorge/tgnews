      <h1>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg returns to bench after illness</h1>

      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg returned to the bench Monday after missing oral arguments last Wednesday <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/ruth-bader-ginsburg-misses-oral-arguments-due-to-illness/">due to a stomach bug</a>.</p>
      <p>The 86-year-old justice was seen climbing the three steps to the bench and taking her seat for a brief court session while wearing one of her signature lace collars.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg and the other justices were present to grant new admissions to the bar, which allows those attorneys to argue before the nation’s highest bench.</p>
      <p>Justice Stephen Breyer was not present Monday because he is traveling, according to CNN.</p>
      <p>While Ginsburg was absent Wednesday, the last time prior to Monday that the justices met in public, she was in the building Friday to take part in the court’s closed-door conference, where CNN reports they presumably took the first initial vote on the fate of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has been treated for cancer twice in the past year, including receiving radiation for a tumor on her pancreas over the summer. She missed court sessions in January during her recovery from lung cancer surgery.</p>
      <p>Last Tuesday, the senior liberal on the bench was an active questioner when the court was in debate over DACA, despite her illness the following day when the court heard two other cases, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-back-bench-n1084806">according to NBC News</a>.</p>
      <p>In October, Justice Clarence Thomas, 71, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/07/justice-clarence-thomas-out-sick-as-supreme-court-begins-new-term/">was out sick</a> with what was believed to be the flu as the high court opened its new term.</p>
      <p>The health of the Brooklyn-born justice is regularly in the spotlight, as her retirement or death would give President Trump a third Supreme Court pick within his first term on a bench where conservatives already hold a 5-4 majority.</p>
