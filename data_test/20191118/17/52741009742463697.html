      <p>Cambridge OPP are looking for a suspect in connection with a gas and dash, plus dangerous driving incident in the city.</p>
      <p>The incident happened around 7 a.m. on Monday, October 21 at a gas station on Hespeler Road.</p>
      <p>An OPP officer was fueling his cruiser, when he was alerted by an employee at the station that a person may not be paying for the gas they just put in their vehicle.</p>
      <p>"The officer spoke to the person with the vehicle ... and directed that person to pay for the fuel. The person indicated they'd be paying momentarily, just looking to do something else, or looking for a method of payment and would be attending into paying for the fuel," said OPP Constable Lauren Ball.</p>
      <p>Shortly after that is when police allege the vehicle left the gas station parking lot in a dangerous manner.</p>
      <p>"They turned the wrong way onto Hespeler Road, travelling north in the southbound lanes - caused the traffic that was travelling southbound to swerve to avoid a collision,"</p>
      <p>The vehicle was then last observed on the 401 overpass.</p>
      <p>Police are looking for a grey Chevrolet Impala.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has information is asked to call Cambridge OPP at 519-654-0150.<br/>Â </p>
