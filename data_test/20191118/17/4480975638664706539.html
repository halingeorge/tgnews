      <p>Fedspeak has resumed on Monday with Cleveland president Mester (hawk) at the University of Maryland who has stated that the US economy is doing well and that the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Fed</a> is on hold while watching how it evolves. </p>
      <h3>Further comments:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>US economic growth is basically around trend.</li>
        <li>There is still solid growth in the labour market.</li>
        <li>The underlying inflation rate looks like it is rising toward Fed's 2% goal.</li>
        <li>Some risks remain, such as uncertainty on U.S. trade policy.</li>
        <li>The U.S. consumer has been strong and resilient.</li>
        <li>Monetary policy is now well-calibrated to the economy.</li>
        <li>The Fed is basically "on hold," watching how US economy evolves.</li>
        <li>She is watching for any signs of sectoral weakness spreading to wider US economy.</li>
        <li>She preferred not to cut interest rates at the Fed's last meeting.</li>
        <li>She is sympathetic to the view though that those interest rate cuts made sense and was a close call.</li>
        <li>Says the Fed should be reviewing its framework periodically.</li>
        <li>Fed is talking about whether to have standing repo facility. </li>
        <li>Fed has not come yet to a determination as to whether to set up a standing repo facility. </li>
        <li>Negative interest rates are negative in Europe and are working better than anticipated.</li>
        <li>She doesn't support using negative rates in the US. </li>

      <h4>FX market implications:</h4>
      <p>There has been no reaction to the comments from Mester, a known hawk, despite her sympathy for the recent rate cuts which took some sting out of the US Dollar which reached a peak of 99.67 back on the 1st of October earlier this year. The DXY is currently trading at 97.74, -0.27% on the day having travelled between 97.68 and 97.98. Manwhile, and according to analysts at Westpac, the markets are pricing a "minimal chance of easing at the December meeting and a terminal rate of 1.27% (vs 1.63% currently)." </p>
