      <h2>The stories behind the matches - these memorable Rams games happened this week in the club's history</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Nicholson</a></address>
      <p>Here, we take a look back at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> matches that took place this week in the club's history.</p>
      <p>But rather than recalling just the match and the result, we look at the stories behind the matches.</p>
      <p>
        <b>24 YEARS AGO ... Nov 21, 1995: Birmingham City 1 Derby County 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>This away win signalled that Derby had found their feet after an early-season struggle.</p>
      <p>The Rams had lost their previous away game 5-1 at Tranmere but successive home wins against West Bromwich Albion and Charlton saw them travel to Birmingham in a more confident mood.</p>
      <p>Goals from Dean Sturridge, Ron Willems, Marco Gabbiadini and Darryl Powell - his first for Derby - gave the Rams victory.</p>
      <p>
        <b>27 YEARS AGO ... 1992: Cosenza 0 Derby County 3</b>
      </p>
      <p>Headers from Andy Comyn and Paul Kitson, and an emphatic finish by Marco Gabbiadini had Derby three up by half time in this Anglo-Italian Cup tie against Cosenza in front of 4,263 at the San Vito Stadium. Derby reached the final of the competition where they were beaten 3-1 by Cremonese at Wembley.</p>

        <b>29 YEARS AGO ... Nov 24, 1990: Derby County 2 Nottingham Forest 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>Derby had won only two of 13 league games going into this home game against rivals Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>Craig Ramage, with his first league goal of the season, and Dean Saunders gave the Rams a 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p>Derby finished the season bottom of Division One and they were relegated.</p>
      <p>
        <b>31 YEARS AGO ... Nov 19, 1988: Aston Villa 1 Derby County 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dean Saunders and Paul Goddard double act was in full swing for Derby.</p>
      <p>They both scored in this 2-1 victory over Aston Villa at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>It was Saunders' fifth goal in four league appearances since he had become Derby's first £1m signing.</p>
      <p>The strikers scored 21 league goals between them during the season as the Rams finished fifth in the top division under Arthur Cox.</p>
      <p>Derby would have qualified for the UEFA Cup but for the ban on English clubs.</p>

        <b>34 YEARS AGO ... 1985: Bolton Wanderers 0 Derby County 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>Forgive the personal indulgence but this was the first Derby County first-team game I covered for the Derby Evening Telegraph having been at the Telegraph for less than a month. Sports editor Gerald Mortimer could not make the fixture at Burnden Park and so I was sent to report on a Gary Micklewhite goal sinking Bolton. John Gregory made his league debut for Derby that afternoon.</p>
      <p>If only to refresh my own memory, the Derby team that day was: Wallington; Blades, Buckley, Williams, Hindmarch, MacLaren, Micklewhite, Christie, Davison, Gregory, Chandler (Garner, 66).</p>
      <p>
        <b>40 YEARS AGO ... Nov 24, 1979: Derby County 4 Nottingham Forest 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>Derby sent reigning European champions Nottingham Forest packing on a remarkable afternoon at the Baseball Ground.</p>
      <p>All pre-match caution about Derby's prospects for this meeting with their rivals was swept away in a delirious burst of goals in the first half.</p>
      <p>Three times in the space of four minutes, the world's best goalkeeper Peter Shilton was left to pick the ball out of the net as Gerry Daly, John Duncan and Steve Emery scored to put Derby 3-0 up inside 17 minutes.</p>
      <p>Forest pulled one back in the second half through John Robertson's penalty, but Duncan put the game out of reach 13 minutes from the end with Derby's fourth.</p>

        <b>47 YEARS AGO ... Nov 18, 1972: West Ham United 1 Derby County 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was so much to admire in this First Division clash at Upton Park.</p>
      <p>The brilliance of Colin Todd and Roy McFarland, the classy Trevor Brooking, the unruffed Bobby Moore, John McGovern's work rate, the control of John O'Hare and the elusive running of Kevin Hector.</p>
      <p>Hector scored both of Derby's goals, the second coming from what was described as a "masterpiece" of a move.</p>
      <p>McGovern swept a pass to Alan Hinton, he turned the ball first-time inside to Terry Hennessey and ran for the return. Hinton's centre to the near post was one few players could have accomplished and there was O'Hare, throwing himself forward, twisting, and sending the ball crashing against the underside of the bar before Hector tucked in the rebound.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Goals from Dave Mackay, John O'Hare and Willie Carlin were not enough to give Derby County victory on a day when the conditions played a big part in the result.</p>
      <p>The rain teemed down in the second half and left the players up to their ankles in mud and standing water on the Baseball Ground pitch.</p>
      <p>The ball shot anywhere and everywhere, and so did players who tried to stop dead or turn quickly.</p>
      <p>The Second Division fixture ended 3-3, but maintained Derby's unbeaten league run that would stretch for 13 matches.</p>
