      <p>And officers have now confirmed a 16-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the alleged incident.</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Officers are carrying out enquiries after receiving a report of a 14-year-old girl having been seriously sexually assaulted in the Royston area of Glasgow on Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>"A 16-year-old male youth has been arrested in connection with the incident and enquiries are ongoing."</p>
      <p>In an unrelated incident, we told earlier how a brute whose girlfriend took her own life after he injured her has been revealed as the drug dealer who <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4968210/lewis-reid-chelsea-bruce-codey-robson/">supplied another tragic teen</a> with ecstasy.</p>
      <p>Lewis Reid, 22, known as Gucci, sold the Class A substance to friends of Chelsea Bruce, who took ill and died after taking some.</p>
      <p>Reid earlier left partner Codey Brown, 18, seriously hurt after accelerating away while she was leaning into his car.</p>
      <p>The popular dance student was found dead months later.</p>
      <p>A court heard how Reid supplied drugs to a group of youngsters who then took them at a house in the city's Springburn area.</p>
      <p>Tragic Chelsea suffered a fit and fell unconscious before being taken by ambulance to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where she died.</p>
