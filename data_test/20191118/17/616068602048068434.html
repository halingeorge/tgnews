      <p>At about 8 a.m. this morning, Armstrong RCMP were notified of a stolen vehicle that was parked on Six Mile Creek Road.</p>
      <p>The officers found the vehicle with a person inside it, but the suspect drove off. He didn't get very far, as the police threw down a spike belt and left the vehicle not driveable.</p>
      <p>The thief then took off on foot into the woods. Using the help of police dogs, the RCMP were able to locate the man and apprehended him.</p>
      <p>"We also had a helicopter deployed to help with our search," says Sgt. Justin Thiessen. "Our officers did an outstanding job to track down the suspect."</p>
      <p>The call took a total of approximately 3 and a half hours, as the RCMP were leaving the scene before noon.</p>
