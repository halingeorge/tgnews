        <b>Max Verstappen stole the show at a chaotic Brazilian Grand Prix with a perfect performance for his third win of the season. But how did the rest of the grid rate? Here are our Interlagos ratings.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Max Verstappen - 10</h3>
      <p>Flawless from the Dutchman who came back after almost having his race ruined by Robert Kubica. Verstappen's pace all weekend was on point and when he had to get his elbows out, he did. Without a doubt a ten!</p>
      <h3>Pierre Gasly - 9.5</h3>
      <p>A memorable day for Pierre Gasly and in complete contrast to the rest of his season. After failing to finish on the podium during his spell at Red Bull, who would've thought he'd kick it with the big boys at Interlagos. Well done Pierre. </p>
      <h3>Carlos Sainz - 9.5</h3>
      <p>To start 20th and finish on the podium is some feet. Not many drivers can boast that accomplishment but after a brief delay Carlos Sainz can. Another great drive from the Spaniard to put himself in contention when it mattered. Another sign of his growing prowess.</p>
      <h3>Kimi Raikkonen - 8.5</h3>
      <p>A great result for Alfa Romeo kicks off with Kimi Raikkonen's P4. His first points finish since racing returned after the summer break and what a result to end his baron spell. </p>
      <h3>Antonio Giovinazzi - 8.5</h3>
      <p>Part two of Alfa's fantastic showing from the Brazilian Grand Prix, Antonio Giovinazzi more than tripled his points tally for the season with his P5. Despite his and his teammate's result going slightly under the radar amidst all the chaos, it was a much-needed result for the constructor.</p>
      <h3>Daniel Ricciardo - 8</h3>
      <p>After being given a penalty for hitting Kevin Magnussen and sitting plumb last all looked lost. However, a great recovery drive to overcome the five-second penalty saw Ricciardo finish sixth. A very satisfying result given the early forecast.</p>
      <h3>Lewis Hamilton - 6</h3>
      <p>He's had plenty of memorable races for the right reasons this season, but the Brazilian Grand Prix of 2019 won't be one of Hamilton's fondest. A bizarre late pit stop dropped him down to third and his clash with Alex Albon caused him even more problems. </p>
      <h3>Lando Norris - 8 </h3>
      <p>A mighty fine result for McLaren is rounded off with a points finish for Norris. After an early battle with Daniel Ricciardo, the Brit had a quiet race but was in the right place at the right time to get some points.</p>
      <h3>Sergio Perez - 8.5</h3>
      <p>Another good result for Perez considering he started in 15th. His result shadowed by the fact there was so much drama elsewhere.</p>
      <h3>Daniil Kvyat - 7.5</h3>
      <p>A great result for Toro Rosso and although Pierre Gasly's performance will grab the headlines Kvyat's solitary point has helped in the battle for midfield supremacy.</p>
      <h3>Kevin Magnussen - 7</h3>
      <p>A frustrating day for the Dane who's race hopes were dented when he came together with Daniel Ricciardo. It could have been a whole lot worse for K-Mag given Haas' struggles this season, but maybe a case of what could've been for Magnussen.</p>
      <h3>George Russell - 8</h3>
      <p>A great result for Russell who scored his second-highest finish at Interlagos. The rookie Brit avoided the drama to finish 12th and continue his rise despite Williams' struggles.</p>
      <h3>Romain Grosjean - 7</h3>
      <p>Was running seventh a one point looking good for the points but after he didn't pit under the safety car things went south. Grosjean dropped down further when he was forced wide by Carlos Sainz. Another case of what if for Haas.</p>
      <h3>Alex Albon - 9</h3>
      <p>It could've been so much better for Albon who suffered heartbreak on the penultimate lap. On course for his first F1 podium and a Red Bull one-two, Hamilton sent an audacious move down the inside resulting in a collision. It ended the Thai driver's hopes of any points, leaving him very frustrated. Up until then he was flawless, so gets a nine from us. </p>
      <h3>Nico Hulkenberg - 6.5</h3>
      <p>A very very quiet day for the Hulk, outperformed by his teammate despite Ricciardo's struggles and he finished down in 15th. His F1 career in danger of peetering out.</p>
      <h3>Robert Kubica - 6.5</h3>
      <p>Unable to keep pace with most of the field as per the majority of the season. Beaten by his teammate again and much like Hulkenberg his season in danger of petering out, not much he can do about it though.</p>
      <h3>Sebastian Vettel - 5</h3>
      <p>The primary catalyst for the collision between himself and his teammate. It had been a tidy drive up until that point despite conceeding P2 early in the race. The damage caused to the team from the collision remains to be seen.</p>
      <h3>Charles Leclerc - 7 </h3>
      <p>Not really to blame for the crash that ended his race and up until that point had been having a great race despite starting down in 14th. </p>
      <h3>Lance Stroll - 6</h3>
      <p>Another late victim in the Albon-Hamilton collision. Stroll was forced to retire with damage picked up from the debris but was classified 19th. Unfortunate for the Canadian.</p>
      <h3>Valtteri Bottas - 7</h3>
      <p>His retirement was not his fault and his racing was going under the radar as he battled back from an average qualifying session. Unfortunate to be the only official retiree from the race.</p>
