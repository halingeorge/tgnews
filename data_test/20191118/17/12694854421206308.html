      <h1>Samsung’s Android 10 beta is about to hit the Galaxy S9 and Note 9</h1>

        <b>The Galaxy S9 and Note 9 are set to join the S10 and <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10">Note 10</a> in Samsung’s Android 10 beta programme – but you might need to wait a little longer to get it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a community manager on Samsung’s Korean community website, the Galaxy Note 9 will join the One UI 2.0 beta early this week. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S9 will be added at some point next week.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this rollout schedule will likely only apply to S9 and Note 9 users who are based in South Korea. Samsung system updates generally land in Korea first, with a global rollout following shortly after − so UK users may need to wait a little longer to update to Android 10.</p>
      <p>That said, the Korean rollout is still a positive sign that Samsung has plans to release the OS on its 2018 flagship models, meaning that S9 and Note 9 users can look forward to seeing One UI 2.0 in the near future regardless of whether or not they decide to update their handsets this year.</p>
      <p>Google initially released Android 10 back in September, with Samsung following with the One UI 2.0 beta for the Galaxy S10 in mid-October.</p>
      <p>Aside from the standard Android 10 updates, Samsung’s custom overlay promises smaller pop-ups, embedded loading bars and simpler button arrangements than found on Android 9 Pie to minimise distractions for users when they stream content on their phones.</p>

      <p>One UI 2.0 also comes with new digital wellness features, a more advanced mode and a smarter battery-saving lock screen.</p>
