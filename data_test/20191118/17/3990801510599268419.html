      <h1>Senior UK judges say cryptoassets, including Bitcoin, are property</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:10:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>Cryptoassets can be treated as tradeable property and smart contracts are “enforceable agreements” under English law.</p>
      <p>That’s according to the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce of the Lawtech Deliver Panel, which today published <a href="https://technation.io/about-us/lawtech-panel/">a 46-page legal statement</a> stating:</p>
      <p>“Cryptoassets, including but not restricted to, virtual currencies, can be treated in principle as property […] smart contracts are capable of satisfying the requirements of contracts in English law and are thus enforceable by the courts. Statutory requirements for a signature can be met by techniques such as private key encryption.”</p>
      <p>The statement comes after a six-month consultation period and provides relative clarity for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.</p>
      <p>Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the High Court, said the initiative was “a watershed for English law and the UK‘s jurisdictions. No other jurisdiction has attempted anything like it.”</p>
      <p>Vos added that the statement represented “not what they would like the law to be, but what they believe English law to be now.”</p>
      <p>“Other jurisdictions have addressed the problem differently, starting with regulations and remedies, and worked backwards […] There is no point in introducing regulations until you understand the legal status of the asset class you are seeking to regulate,” he added.</p>
      <p>The taskforce has now asked the Law Commission – tasked with keeping the law of England and Wales under review and to recommend reforms — to confirm if any legislation would be desirable.</p>
