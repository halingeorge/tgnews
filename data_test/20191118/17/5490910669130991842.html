      <h1>Prada Revamps Web Site, Introduces Time Capsule Project</h1>
      <h2>Each month, the brand will release a limited-edition product available to purchase exclusively on its e-commerce and just for 24 hours.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:04:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Sandra Salibian</a></address>
      <p><b>NEW PRAD-UCT:</b> Iconic <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/prada-2/">Prada</a> archival pieces may now be just a click away from customers’ wardrobes.</p>
      <p>As part of the revamp of its web site, next month the fashion house will launch the new <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/north-sails-to-create-capsule-for-americas-cup-1203372774/">Prada</a> Time Capsule section, where special product for men and women will be available for purchase exclusively on the platform and just for a 24-hour period. Changing every month and often bowing from the brand’s archives, each item will be offered in a limited-edition and bear a serial number.</p>
      <p>Although keeping details under wraps, the company said on Monday that the first drop will focus on a ready-to-wear item.</p>
      <p>The Prada Time Capsule project heightens the company’s increasingly strong digital focus. As part of the strategy, the label has revamped its web site and e-commerce platform with a sleek layout and editorial content boosting its user-friendly, flexible and omnichannel features.</p>
      <p>The web site offers an interactive experience via mini-videos playing during navigation and personalized contents varying through a modular framework based on users’ needs, all available from any device.</p>

      <p>In particular, the “Pradasphere” section offers a tour through fashion shows, special projects, campaigns, films, events and locations of the Prada universe via two browsing paths, with the possibility to apply filters by category and year.</p>
      <p>Currently available only in Europe, the revamped prada.com will be rolled out to other markets throughout 2020.</p>
