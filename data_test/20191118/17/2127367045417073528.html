According to information received on Monday, Kohli and Rahane are scheduled to land at 9:40 am on Tuesday, much ahead of the rest of the team.</p>
      <p>It's still unclear whether the captain would visit the Eden Gardens on Tuesday to have a look at the pitch, but there are chances of him dropping by, according to sources.</p>
      <p>The Eden track is expected to be a green top which the red hot Indian pace bowling battery would relish. The 22-yard strip was under covers on Monday with pitch curator Sujan Mukherjee saying that there won't be any pink ball testing before the action starts at 1 pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>Besides Kohli and Rahane, Rohit Sharma will land in the wee hours of Wednesday, at 1:55 am while pacers Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav will arrive a bit later on the same day, at 9:35 am.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma will also reach on Tuesday, at 10:45 in the night. The rest of the team is expected to come together at 12:30 pm on Tuesday along with the Bangladesh team.</p>
