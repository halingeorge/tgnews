      <h2>Exciting times for Stadia fans. With the release tomorrow, Google has revealed its launch catalogue of titles.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T17:13:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Osborn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-osborn/</a></address>
      <p>Stadia is Google's new game streaming platform that they say is "set to revolutionise the way gamers access, play and enjoy their favourite games."</p>
      <p>Stadia is a cloud base gaming platform boasting up to 4K at 60 Frames Per Second with the Pro subscription. <br/><br/>The base Stadia can run at 1080p at 60FPS. Users will be able to play on any Chrome browser, Pixel 3/3a and 4. <br/><br/>The Stadia controller is the real mastermind of the show, connecting directly to the game running in Google's data centres.</p>
      <p>Not only does this allow you to play games with no download, but also switch seamlessly from browser to phone using the controller's smart capabilities to pause the state of your game whilst loading it up on another device.</p>
