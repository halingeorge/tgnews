      <p>It is expected to benefit around 15% their employees.</p>
      <p>Confirming the news Maeve Mc Cleane, HR Director of <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/lidl">Lidl</a> Ireland said: “We are delighted to be the first major nationwide food retailer to commit to the latest Living Wage in Ireland.</p>
