      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liam-payne/">Liam Payne</a> is braver than most as he stripped off for a new music video, taking a dip in the chilly English sea on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Never one to miss an opportunity to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/liam-payne-basically-shot-soft-core-porn-as-he-poses-naked-with-stella-maxwell-for-hugo-campaign-11036671/">get his kit off</a>, we think the singer-turned-underwear-model might have gone a little bit too far this time, as he submerged himself below the British waters on a nippy November day.</p>
      <p>Shooting the music video for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/liam-payne-kisses-maya-henry-break-shooting-live-forever-music-video-topless-freezing-weather-11078153/">his new single Live Forever</a>, the former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> star braved the English Channel on a chilly morning, with the temperature dipping to just 12 degrees.</p>
      <p>Forgetting to bring his trunks with him (silly boy!), Liam, 26, was forced to head into the sea in his trousers, giving us a major throwback to that one school swimming lesson where we had to swim in our pyjamas.</p>
      <p>No? Just us?</p>
      <p>Dipping his head below the surface in order to acclimatise to the near-Arctic temperatures (honestly, how do you ever get used to that?), the singer did his thing as he moodily stared into the camera, tattoos proudly displayed.</p>

      <p>While filming in icy water on a Monday on the Isle of Wight might not be everyone’s cup of tea – it’s definitely not ours – the cold conditions might have served to be the ultimate hangover cure for Liam, who was photographed out at a London nightclub with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/liam-payne-holds-hands-maya-henry-date-night-opening-cheryl-split-11126305/">girlfriend Maya Henry</a> in the early hours of the morning.</p>

      <p>Sort of like splashing your face with water, just on a really large scale.</p>

      <p>However, while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/liam-payne-kisses-maya-henry-break-shooting-live-forever-music-video-topless-freezing-weather-11078153/">Maya was present during the first day of filming</a> for the video last week, we’re guessing the cold weather was a bit much for the 19-year-old model this time, with Liam braving the beach alone.</p>
      <p>Honestly, we don’t blame her.</p>
