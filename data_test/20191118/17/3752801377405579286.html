      <p>A recent flare-up in gang violence in Hanover Park has claimed the life of a bystander, as a woman was caught in the crossfire on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Police responded to the scene in Donegal Court, Hanover Park, on Sunday afternoon, where they found the body of the 28-year-old victim.</p>
      <p>She had been shot in her upper body.</p>
      <p>Provincial police spokesperson Mihlali Majikela said the circumstances surrounding the incident were still under investigation.</p>
      <p>However, police sources have told News24 that the woman had not been the intended target of the shooting.</p>
      <p>Two people have been arrested in connection with the shooting, News24 has been informed. Provincial police, however, could not immediately confirm this.</p>
      <p>Gang tensions in the area flared up earlier this month between the Americans and the Ghetto Kids, resulting in gunfire and unrest.</p>
      <p>Hanover Park, which falls under the Philippi police precinct, is one of 10 areas where the army has been deployed to help in joint operations with the police.</p>
      <p>Together with Elsies River, Bishop Lavis, Mitchells Plain, Delft, Nyanga, Khayelitsha, Mfuleni, Kraaifontein and Manenberg, the precinct has the province's highest attempted murder rate.</p>
      <p>After an initial two-month deployment, President Cyril Ramaphosa extended the SANDF's stay in September for an additional six months, to March 31, 2020.</p>
