      <p>For its latest true-crime docuseries, <i>The Confession Killer, </i>Netflix is tackling the case of Henry Lee Lucas, a serial killer who confessed to the murder of hundreds of people — and not only did Lucas confess, he made a show of sketching out victims and describing their deaths in detail to investigators. </p>
      <p>However, Lucas's copious confessions proved implausible when lawyers, journalists, and forensic DNA analysis poked holes in his seemingly endless killing spree. Such implausibilities forced investigators to open cases that Lucas's confessions had closed, and upended the closure grieving families had found in those confessions.</p>
      <p>Dubbed "The Deadly Drifter" in the 1980s, the entire ordeal surrounding the plausibility of Lucas's confessions earned him a new nickname: <i>The Confession Killer</i>. The five-part docuseries explores the truth behind Henry Lee Lucas and how his story revealed inadequacies in the United States justice system.</p>
      <p><i>The Confession Killer </i>debuts on Netflix on Dec. 6.</p>
