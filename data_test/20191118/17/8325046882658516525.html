There’s a ton of holiday content to stream, so you might as well get started now to get it all in before it’s New Year’s Day before you know it.</p>
      <p>We’ve rounded up the best holiday offerings on Hulu to help you cut down on tedious decision making so you can get down to that warm and fuzzy, feel good, deck-the-halls Christmas movie binging.</p>
      <p>Don’t have Hulu yet? We’ve got you covered. While a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-hulu-basic">Hulu Basic subscription</a> might serve you ads, it’s by far the cheapest streaming service on the market at just <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=42392&amp;amp;u1=biipf_092019_best-christmas-movies-hulu&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fwelcome">$5.99 a month</a>. Since I can’t stand ads, I <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hulu-premium-review">recommend upgrading to Hulu Premium</a>, so you can stream uninterrupted. It’s a bit of a price jump at $12.99 a month, but I’ve never regretted it. If you’re still not sure which level of service is right for you, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-is-hulu">check out this complete price breakdown</a> of everything Hulu has to offer.
