      <p>A former occult member and a former aide to the leader and founder of Ebenezer Miracle Worship Center Rev. Obampour, identified as Dominic William Appiah has revealed the reason why his former boss can’t travel.</p>
      <p>It has now become a common practice to see rich men of God travel outside their countries to a different country either to go for a programme, seek treatment or just to relax and chill after winning souls for Christ.</p>
      <p>In Ghana, the likes of Rev. Obofour and Angel Bishop Daniel Obinim are typical examples of men of God who travel out of the country anyhow.</p>
      <p>Rev. Obamfour real name Ebenezer Adarkwa Yiadom is one of the big pastors we have in the country. Though he is rich he has never traveled out shared photos of him traveling or having fun outside Ghana.</p>
      <p>Many people have questioned why he doesn’t travel out whiles others believe he travels out but doesn’t share it.</p>
      <p>Well, according to Dominic Appiah in an exclusive interview with Ghpage TV has revealed his former boss has never traveled outside Ghana before because it’s a taboo for him to cross a river or a sea.</p>
      <p>Watch the interview below:</p>

      <p>He stated that whenever Opambour whom he refers to as a bad person crosses any water he gets an accident and because of that he is scared to travel outside of Kumasi.</p>
      <p>Evangelist Dominic also in the interview asked that if people think he is telling lies they should just go straight to Opambour and ask him why the church branch in Accra collapsed.</p>
