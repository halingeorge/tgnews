      <p>The Buffalo Sabres opened practice shortly after noon today in KeyBank Center and the injury news got particularly darker for the team just as it stepped on the ice.</p>
      <p>In their weekly injury report, the Sabres acknowledged that veteran winger Kyle Okposo suffered another concussion Saturday night against Ottawa and is listed as out indefinitely. The club also announced that winger Tage Thompson is out 3-5 weeks with an upper-body injury. He appeared to injure his shoulder in a collision with the glass with less than three minutes to go in Sunday's 4-1 loss in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Centers Marcus Johansson and Johan Larsson (both upper body) are listed as day to day but neither practiced Monday. Vladimir Sobotka (lower body) is listed as out 4-6 weeks. Coach Ralph Krueger said after practice thatÂ  Johansson and Larsson will be out for Tuesday's game against Minnesota here but could be possible for the upcoming road trip that opens Thursday in Boston.</p>
      <p>"It was a really long stretch with the same four forwards lines and there was some good synergy there," coach Ralph Krueger said after practice. "The process seemed to be quite automatic, especially the way we want to be connected on the ice. Losing a forward a game for five games now has been quite disruptive but the guys are working hard to find the right path."</p>
      <p>Defenseman Zach Bogosian, on the road back from hip surgery, has been upgraded to day to day and was skating at forward in practice so the team could work out with four lines.</p>

      <p>The Okposo news is particularly grim because that would be his fourth concussion since joining the Sabres and his second in this calendar year. Okposo suffered another in a fight in February with New York Rangers defenseman Tony DeAngelo.</p>
      <p>Okposo, of course, had serious issues with post-concussion rehab in the summer of 2017, landing in the Neuro ICU unit of Buffalo General Hospital. He still has three more years remaining on his contract that has a cap hit of $6 million per season. He has just one goal and four assists in 19 games this season.</p>
      <p>The Sabres are exceptionally thin at forward now, as the only players left at Rochester on NHL contracts are J-S Dea and Andrew Oglevie. Remi Elie, Scott Wilson and C.J. Smith are all out long-term in Rochester with injuries.</p>
      <p>Krueger said the team could dress 11 forwards and seven defensemen for the game against the Wild but is also pondering a callup of one of the two remaining forwards in Rochester. Krueger said the team is not currently considering a callup of No. 1 draft choice Dylan Cozens on an emergency basis from Lethbridge of the Western Hockey League.</p>
