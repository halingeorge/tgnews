      <p>This week’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/trump-impeachment-major-players-timeline-what-comes-next-2019-11">impeachment hearings</a> will kick off on Tuesday with four current and former administration officials scheduled to testify in open session.</p>
      <p>Here’s who’s testifying:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council.</li>
        <li>Jennifer Williams, a foreign service aide detailed to Vice President Mike Pence.</li>
        <li>Tim Morrison, the NSC’s former official in charge of overseeing Russia and Europe policy.</li>
        <li>Kurt Volker, the US’s former Special Representative to Ukraine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Vindman and Williams will testify together beginning at 9 a.m. ET before the House Intelligence Committee. Morrison and Volker will jointly testify in a second hearing beginning at 2:30 p.m. ET.</p>
      <p>The hearings will be broadcast live on C-SPAN and all the major cable news networks. They will also be streamed on YouTube, and Insider will embed a livestream of both hearings here when they begin.</p>
      <p>Both Williams and Vindman directly listened in on the July 25 call between President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that’s at the centre of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Vindman also witnessed efforts by John Eisenberg, the NSC’s chief lawyer, to bury records of the call after several officials sounded the alarm over what Trump had said.</p>
      <p>During the phone call, Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Joe Biden</a> and his son for corruption. He also asked Zelensky to look into a bogus conspiracy theory suggesting it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election and that it did so to benefit Hillary Clinton’s campaign.</p>
      <p>Volker and Morrison will give testimony showing how the phone call was just one data point in a months-long shadow foreign policy campaign to strongarm Ukraine into delivering Trump the political dirt he wanted. While doing so, the president withheld a $US391 million vital military aid package to Ukraine as well as a White House meeting for Zelensky.</p>
      <p>Three officials are scheduled to testify on Wednesday: Gordon Sondland, the US’s ambassador to the European Union; Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department; and David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs at the State Department.</p>
      <p>The last hearing this week will take place on Thursday morning, with just one official scheduled to appear: Fiona Hill, the NSC’s former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs.</p>
