      <p><i>Behind the Wheel</i> is a new video series that shows you a bit of what it’s like to work at <i>Autoblog</i>. The editors and video producers will show you the cars passing through our fleet, and you’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the personalities who help make the site run. </p>
      <p>Episode 3 features the 2020 <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/">Toyota</a> GR <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/toyota+supra/">Supra</a> and <i>Autoblog</i> Editor Zac Palmer. We were so excited to hear how it sounded, we couldn't help but rev the motor in our parking lot under the building. Apparently, the exhaust note of this BMW-Toyota collab was so loud it could be heard from inside our second-floor office.</p>
      <p>Do you like this video? Disagree with our take on the Supra? What cars do you want to see in our fleet? We’d love to hear from you so please comment below!</p>
