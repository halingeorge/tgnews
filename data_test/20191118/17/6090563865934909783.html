      <p>Defending Afcon champions Algeria are now leading Group H with 6 points from 2 matches after beating battling Botswana Zebras 1 nil.</p>
      <p>The visitors scored after 14 minutes direct from a corner kick taken by Youcef Belaili. Botswana reacted by pouring men forward but their final act was not good enough to trouble the Algerian goalkeeper.<br/>The Zebras finished the match with 10 men after one of theirs was given marching orders for picking a second booking with ten minutes to go.<br/>But they still threw men forward until the final whistle against a not so perfect Algeria.<br/>Zimbabwe will consolidate their second position on the table if they avoid a defeat away in Zambia where they are playing the other Group H fixture later today.</p>
