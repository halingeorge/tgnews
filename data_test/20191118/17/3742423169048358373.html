      <h1>Ease Your Way Into Sherry With The Adonis</h1>

      <p>There are many advantages to having cocktail experts for friends. Besides being excellent hosts, they often (quite generously) provide me with inspiration and recipes for this column. Usually, they end up directing me to classic cocktails I had somehow missed. It’s <i>very</i> helpful.</p>
      <p>About a week ago, I messaged my friend Devojka who runs an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pinkpanthermtl/">invite-only cocktail party</a> in Montreal, asking her to please help because I was out of cocktail ideas. She sent me back a long list of classics, which included the Adonis—a cocktail comprised of equal parts Fino Sherry and sweet vermouth. I have been on a <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/11/this-vermouth-and-pear-cocktail-is-ideal-for-crisp-evenings">Carpano Antica kick</a> recently, so this one called to me.</p>
      <p>If you’ve never really gotten “into” sherry, the Adonis is a great entry point. With only two ingredients, it’s a good chance to explore the flavour of the almond-forward, straw coloured sherry, and figure out your preferences in terms of ratios and brands. Devojka also pointed out that “with so few ingredients, it’s a really great opportunity to put care into the basics like foundations and techniques, like freezing ice in a block to chip versus using refrigerator ice.” The Adonis is a stirred cocktail, but you can play around with format by trying it up or on a big rock, or you can build the whole thing directly in a lowball. To make it, you will need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>45ml Fino Sherry</li>
        <li>45ml ounces sweet vermouth</li>
        <li>2 dashes orange bitters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Add everything to a glass filled with ice and stir for about 30 seconds. Strain into a lowball over a big rock and garnish with a strip of lemon zest, expressing the oils from the strip before hanging it on the edge of the glass. (Yes, this will technically raise your ingredient count to four, so skip it if you’re not into that.)</p>
