      <p>Notts County have been given an initial allocation of 954 tickets for their FA Cup clash at Northampton Town.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> head to Sixfields on Sunday, December 1, with a 2pm kick-off with the game set to feature on the BBC’s Final Score programme.</p>
      <p>Tickets have now gone on priority sale to season ticket holders, and members of Lifeline and the Official Supporters’ Association.</p>
      <p>Prices are £15 for adults, seniors are £12, juniors are £5 and under-7s are free.</p>
      <p>Tickets can be purchased online by clicking <a href="https://www.eticketing.co.uk/nottscountyfc/">here</a>, or by calling 0115 955 7210 or in person at the Meadow Lane ticket office.</p>

      <p>Tickets to the value of £1.50 and above will be subject to a 60p per ticket admin fee when purchased online or by phone.</p>
      <p>The Magpies will hope to take a sizable following to Sixfields where Notts were held to a goalless draw last term under previous manager Harry Kewell.</p>
      <p>They then hosted the Cobblers at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/meadow-lane">Meadow Lane</a> in April and again the sides could not be separated as the game finished 2-2.</p>
      <p>Northampton are now managed by Keith Curle, who is a former manager of Notts and they are currently seventh in League Two.</p>
