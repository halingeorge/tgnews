        <li>The entertainer said that she couldn’t recall specific instances, but added that she was affected by the perception.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jennifer-lopez">Jennifer Lopez</a> says that years ago, she was perceived as a “diva” because of her identity.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Jessica Pressler, the writer of the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/12/robin-hood-strippers-scores-c-v-r.html#_ga=2.256878859.1080210481.1574097550-1506774276.1574097550">New York magazine article that inspired “Hustlers,”</a> for <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-icon-of-the-year-2019">GQ</a>, Lopez was asked: “You have been through so much in your career, like there was that whole early-2000s ‘She’s a diva’ thing. Now that we are in this period of sort of increased awareness of that, do you ever have moments where you look back and you’re like, ‘Wow, that was sexist or racist’-or otherwise, you know, f—edup?”</p>
      <p>“For sure,” the 50-year-old <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/hustlers">“Hustlers”</a> star said in response. “Because I was Latin, and I was a woman, and I was Puerto Rican, and they were not giving me the same pass that they gave everybody else at certain times.”</p>
      <p>Lopez continued: “It’s hard to remember specifics. I wish I could. But honestly, I don’t like to harp on the negative or feel sorry for myself. You know, it, it just is what it is.”</p>
      <p>The entertainer went on to say that the public’s perception briefly affected her, but it also pushed her to do more, “be better, all the time,” and make opportunities for herself.</p>
      <p>“Just, be resilient. They’ll give up,” she added.</p>
      <p>In the early-2000s, Lopez made strides as a musician and as an actress. She released her second studio album, “J.Lo,” in January 2001 and dropped another album the following year titled “This Is Me… Then.” The albums included popular songs like “Love Don’t Cost a Thing,” “Jenny From the Block,” and “All I Have.”</p>
      <p>She made history as the first woman to have a No. 1 movie and album in the same week in 2001, thanks to “The Wedding Planner” and “J.Lo.”</p>
      <p>Lopez also appeared in romantic comedies like “The Wedding Planner,” “Maid in Manhattan,” and “Shall We Dance.” In addition, she starred alongside ex-fiancé Ben Affleck in the poorly-received 2003 movie “Gigli.” Her romantic relationships with Affleck, ex-husband Cris Judd, Sean “Diddy” Combs, and ex-husband Marc Anthony also gained a lot of attention from the media and fans.</p>
      <p>Now, Lopez is <a href="https://www.insider.com/jennifer-lopez-shakira-performing-2020-super-bowl-halftime-show-2019-9">preparing for her Super Bowl halftime show with Shakira</a>, <a href="https://www.insider.com/alex-rodriguez-exes-invited-to-jennifer-lopez-wedding-video-2019-9">wedding planning with fiancé Alex Rodriguez</a>, and receiving plenty of <a href="https://www.insider.com/jennifer-lopez-oscar-buzz-for-hustlers-is-deserved-2019-9">Oscar buzz</a> for her <a href="https://www.insider.com/hustlers-movie-review-jennifer-lopez-constance-wu-cardi-b-lizzo-2019-8">performance as a stripper named Ramona in the female-led film “Hustlers.”</a></p>
