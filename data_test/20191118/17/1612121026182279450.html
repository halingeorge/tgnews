      <p>If you have a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343104-sony-xperia-august-2019-security-patch/">Sony device</a> you’re probably itching to get a taste of Android 10. While Sony is usually pretty good about pushing out updates quickly, we still haven’t seen the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343746-android-10-official/">latest Android OS</a> on Xperia phones yet.</p>
      <p>The company has released a roadmap of what phones will be getting Android 10, and when that update is happening. Check if yours is on the list.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>From December 2019</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/337593-sony-xperia-1-with-219-4k-oled-display-and-4-cameras-launched-at-mwc-2019/">Xperia 1</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343793-sony-xperia-5-ifa-2019/">Xperia 5</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>From early 2020</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Xperia 10</li>
            <li>Xperia 10 Plus</li>
            <li>Xperia XZ2</li>
            <li>Xperia XZ2 Compact</li>
            <li>Xperia XZ2 Premium</li>
            <li>Xperia XZ3</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their newest devices, like the Xperia 1 and Xperia 5, should see the update next month. Older devices are set to follow at the beginning of next year, which is only a couple months away. The only disappointment here is the lack of many mid-range devices, aside from the Xperia 10 phones. Some of those will still likely get Android 10, we just don’t have an official roadmap for it yet.</p>
