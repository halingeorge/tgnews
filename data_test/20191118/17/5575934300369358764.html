        <li>First, consider the symptoms. Allergies cause itchy eyes and nose whereas the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/common-cold">common cold</a> comes with headaches and body aches.</li>
        <li>Keep track of how long your symptoms last. The common cold typically lasts <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-long-does-a-cold-last">7-10 days</a> whereas allergies can last for much longer.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to the time of year when you feel symptoms. If your sniffles hit in wintertime, chances are you have a common cold, not allergies.</li>

      <p>There’s a lot of overlap between cold and allergy symptoms, and it’s not always easy to tell what’s causing your sniffles.</p>
      <p>“But there are some clues,” says <a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler">David Cutler</a>, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Centre.</p>
      <h3>Is it a cold or allergies?</h3>
      <p>First, consider the symptoms. Colds and allergies both lead to sneezing, sniffling, and congestion, <a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/memorialcare-medical-group/find-providers/physician/kristine-arthur-md">Kristine Arthur</a>, an internist at MemorialCare Medical Group, says. But there are some key symptoms that set each illness apart.</p>
      <p>Got an itchy sensation in your eyes or nose? That’s a tipoff you have allergies.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you’re suffering from a headache, body aches, and a mild fever, those are signature symptoms of a <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-long-is-a-cold-contagious">cold</a>, not allergies.</p>
      <p>And while it might be gross, take a good look at your snot. If it’s thin and clear, you probably have allergies. But if it’s thick and discolored, then it’s probably a cold, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>
      <p>In addition to identifying what your symptoms are, keep track of how quickly they came on and how long they have lasted. This is also helpful to figure out whether you have allergies or a cold.</p>
      <p>Often a person will feel OK for long periods before the cold’s nasal and throat symptoms fully set in, Cutler says. And a cold typically lasts three to 10 days – although it can stick around for several weeks – according to the Mayo Clinic.</p>
      <p>By contrast, allergies ramp up more quickly and symptoms tend to last for as long as the allergen is present.</p>
      <p>So while your body will eventually recover from a cold in <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-long-does-a-cold-last">7 to 10 days</a>, you’ll continue to suffer from allergies as long as you’re exposed to what’s triggering them. And that brings us to the final clue: the season.</p>
      <p>A common allergy for many is hay fever, which is an allergy to plant pollen. It will usually strike from February through June when blooming plants distribute their pollen. But the exact timing can vary depending on when plants bloom and release pollen. To suss out if the pollen counts are high where you live, check out the pollen map on the <a href="https://www.aaaai.org/global/nab-pollen-counts">National Allergy Bureau website</a>.</p>
      <p>If sniffles hit during the wintertime – and particularly if people around you have similar symptoms – odds are you have a cold, not allergies, Arthur says.</p>
      <h3>How to treat allergies and a cold</h3>
      <p>Allergies are caused by your body’s immune system responding to a commonplace trigger, like pollen or cat dander. To fight off the trigger, your immune system releases chemicals called histamines that cause an allergic reaction.</p>
      <p>To <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-get-rid-of-a-runny-nose">treat allergies</a>, you’ll need to either avoid the trigger altogether or take medications, like antihistamines, to counteract your immune system’s response. Antihistamines help by blocking the effect of histamines, hence the term antihistamine. This, in turn, helps relieve your symptoms.</p>
      <p>“Some people need to stay on antihistamines long term if they have year-round allergies,” Arthur adds.</p>
      <p>A cold is caused by a virus. There’s no cure that can treat the virus, but there are medications that can relieve your symptoms. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help alleviate pain and reduce your fever, while decongestants will reduce congestion. <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-sleep-with-a-stuffy-nose">Get rest</a> and drink a <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-to-eat-when-you-have-a-cold">lot of fluids</a>.</p>
      <p>Then there’s always a possibility you’ll be struck with allergies and the cold simultaneously. So if your symptoms aren’t easing, and you’re just not sure if it’s a cold, allergies, or both, make an appointment with your doctor.</p>
