        <p>And it looks set to stick around as Fitbit has also got the same price on the <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/shop/versa?color=petal">Versa 2 over at the Fitbit Store</a>.</p>
        <p>We would be surprised to see a better deal than this over the course of Black Friday - but of course, there's plenty of time for retailers to try and go one better.</p>

        <p>We gave the <a href="https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-versa-2-review-7533">Fitbit Versa 2</a> a 4/5 review, concluding "Alexa is the star of the show here, but it’s the small improvements in the design and software that really make the Versa 2 feel like a leap ahead."</p>
        <p>If you haven't been following along, Amazon Alexa is the biggest addition to the Fitbit Versa 2. This lets you use Amazon's digital assistant straight from your wrist to do pretty much anything Alexa is famed for.</p>

          <p>There's also a new Spotify app and other software improvements including the debut of Sleep Score, Smart Wake, Sleep Mode and the Estimated Oxygen Variation Graph features.</p>

          <p>While the Amazon deal has been the best out the gate, it seems other retailers are gearing up for the big day with deals of their own. In the US we're seeing more and more Versa 2 deals get released from big retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Target and even smaller stores are running some deals.</p>
          <p>Walmart just <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fitbit-Versa-2-Smartwatch/590748121">went live with their Versa 2 deal</a> which matches Amazon's price drop and includes free shipping. Soon after we saw <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/fitbit-versa-2-smartwatch-40mm-aluminum-black-carbon-with-silicone-band/6364307.p?skuId=6364307">Best Buy release their deal</a> and <a href="https://www.target.com/p/fitbit-versa-2-smartwatch/-/A-77677108?preselect=76633970#lnk=sametab">Target followed suit</a> dropping the price to just $149.95.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing some department stores with price drops. Macy's <a href="https://www.macys.com/shop/product/fitbit-versa-2-black-elastomer-strap-touchscreen-smart-watch-39mm?ID=10130328&amp;CategoryID=23930">has a deal</a> matching the other big retailers and Kohl's <a href="https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-3870437/fitbit-versa-2-smartwatch.jsp?color=Black%20Carbon%20Aluminum&amp;prdPV=1">dropped the price on the Versa 2 to $149.99</a> and is even throwing in $30 Kohl's Cash with purchase.</p>
          <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
          <p>While the bigger stores are having some killer Versa 2 deals this year, you don't want to overlook smaller specialty shops and warehouse clubs.</p>
          <p>Costco just released their <a href="https://www.costco.com/fitbit-versa-2-bundle,-black.product.100510619.html">Versa 2 Black Friday bundle deal</a> which members will be able to score for $139.99 and of the smaller shops we've seen B&amp;H Photo Video <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1501922-REG/fitbit_fb507bkbk_versa_2_health.html">drop $50 on the Versa 2</a>.</p>
          <p>If you do fancy waiting it out, there's a strong chance the Fitbit Versa 2 - among other Fitbit devices - will feature heavily in the Black Friday 2019 discounts. Be sure to check out our other articles as we gear up for the deals bonanza.</p>
